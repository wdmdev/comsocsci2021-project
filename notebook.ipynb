N G \\n\\nHARRY \\n\\nPOTTER \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n/ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WORST BIRTHDAY \\n\\nNot for the first time, an argument had broken out \\nover breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. \\nVernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of \\nthe morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew \\nHarry’s room. \\n\\n“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If \\nyou can’t control that owl, it’ll have to go!” \\n\\nHarry tried, yet again, to explain. \\n\\n“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around \\noutside. If I could just let her out at night — ” \\n\\n“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of \\nfried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. “I know \\nwhat 11 happen if that owl’s let out.” \\n\\nHe exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. \\n\\nHarry tried to argue back but his words were drowned \\nby a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley. \\n\\nPage | 2 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“I want more bacon.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt \\nPetunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. “We \\nmust build you up while we’ve got the chance. ... I \\ndon’t like the sound of that school food. ...” \\n\\n“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when / was \\nat Smeltings,” said Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley \\ngets enough, don’t you, son?” \\n\\nDudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over \\neither side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to \\nHarry. \\n\\n“Pass the frying pan.” \\n\\n“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry \\nirritably. \\n\\nThe effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the \\nfamily was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his \\nchair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. \\nDursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands \\nto her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins \\nthrobbing in his temples. \\n\\n“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean \\n\\n\\n\\n“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, \\nspraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ \\nWORD IN OUR HOUSE?” \\n\\n“But I — ” \\n\\n“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared \\nUncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 3 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I just — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION \\nOF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!” \\n\\nHarry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale \\naunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. \\n\\n“All right,” said Harry, “all right ...” \\n\\nUncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded \\nrhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the \\ncorners of his small, sharp eyes. \\n\\nEver since Harry had come home for the summer \\nholidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a \\nbomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry \\nPotter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he \\nwas as not normal as it is possible to be. \\n\\nHarry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his \\nfirst year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and \\nWizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have \\nhim back for the holidays, it was nothing to how \\nHarry felt. \\n\\nHe missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a \\nconstant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its \\nsecret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though \\nperhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail \\narriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, \\nsleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, \\nvisiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to \\nthe Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, \\nQuidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding \\nworld (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and \\nfourteen players on broomsticks). \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 4 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and \\ntop-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had \\nbeen locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle \\nVernon the instant Harry had come home. What did \\nthe Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House \\nQuidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all \\nsummer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went \\nback to school without any of his homework done? \\n\\nThe Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a \\ndrop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as \\nthey were concerned, having a wizard in the family \\nwas a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had \\neven padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, \\nto stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the \\nwizarding world. \\n\\nHarry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle \\nVernon was large and neckless, with an enormous \\nblack mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and \\nbony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on \\nthe other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant \\ngreen eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. \\nHe wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a \\nthin, lightning-shaped scar. \\n\\nIt was this scar that made Harry so particularly \\nunusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only \\nhint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he \\nhad been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years \\nbefore. \\n\\nAt the age of one year old, Harry had somehow \\nsurvived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all \\ntime, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and \\nwizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died \\nin Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his \\nlightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood \\nwhy — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the \\ninstant he had failed to kill Harry. \\n\\nPage | 5 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s \\nsister and her husband. He had spent ten years with \\nthe Dursleys, never understanding why he kept \\nmaking odd things happen without meaning to, \\nbelieving the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar \\nin the car crash that had killed his parents. \\n\\nAnd then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to \\nHarry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had \\ntaken up his place at wizard school, where he and his \\nscar were famous . . . but now the school year was \\nover, and he was back with the Dursleys for the \\nsummer, back to being treated like a dog that had \\nrolled in something smelly. \\n\\nThe Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today \\nhappened to be Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of course, \\nhis hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a \\nreal present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it \\ncompletely ... \\n\\nAt that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat \\nimportantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a \\nvery important day.” \\n\\nHarry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. \\n\\n“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of \\nmy career,” said Uncle Vernon. \\n\\nHarry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought \\nbitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid \\ndinner party. He’d been talking of nothing else for two \\nweeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to \\ndinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge \\norder from him (Uncle Vernon’s company made drills). \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 6 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think we should run through the schedule one \\nmore time,” said Uncle Vernon. “We should all be in \\nposition at eight o’clock. Petunia, you will be — ?” \\n\\n“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting \\nto welcome them graciously to our home.” \\n\\n“Good, good. And Dudley?” \\n\\n“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a \\nfoul, simpering smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and \\nMrs. Mason?” \\n\\n“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously. \\n\\n“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he \\nrounded on Harry. “And you?” \\n\\n“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and \\npretending I’m not there,” said Harry tonelessly. \\n\\n“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them \\ninto the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour \\nthem drinks. At eight-fifteen — ” \\n\\n“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia. \\n\\n“And, Dudley, you 11 say — ” \\n\\n“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. \\nMason?” said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an \\ninvisible woman. \\n\\n“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia. \\n\\n“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. \\n\\n“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending \\nI’m not there,” said Harry dully. \\n\\nPage | 7 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good \\ncompliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. \\n\\nMason. ... Do tell me where you bought your dress, \\nMrs. Mason. ...” \\n\\n“Perfect ... Dudley?” \\n\\n“How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our \\nhero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’ ” \\n\\nThis was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. \\nAunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, \\nwhile Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t \\nsee him laughing. \\n\\n“And you, boy?” \\n\\nHarry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. \\n\\n“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending \\nI’m not there,” he said. \\n\\n“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \\n\\n“The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s \\ngoing to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take \\nMrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, \\nand I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any \\nluck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the \\nnews at ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in \\nMajorca this time tomorrow.” \\n\\nHarry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t \\nthink the Dursleys would like him any better in \\nMajorca than they did on Privet Drive. \\n\\n“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner \\njackets for Dudley and me. And you,” he snarled at \\n\\nPage | 8 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way while she’s \\ncleaning.” \\n\\nHarry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, \\nsunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on \\nthe garden bench, and sang under his breath: \\n\\n“Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me ...” \\n\\nNo cards, no presents, and he would be spending the \\nevening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably \\ninto the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than \\nanything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing \\nQuidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron \\nWeasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn’t \\nseem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had \\nwritten to him all summer, even though Ron had said \\nhe was going to ask Harry to come and stay. \\n\\nCountless times, Harry had been on the point of \\nunlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to \\nRon and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth \\nthe risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use \\nmagic outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the \\nDursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he \\nmight turn them all into dung beetles that stopped \\nthem from locking him in the cupboard under the \\nstairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first \\ncouple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering \\nnonsense words under his breath and watching \\nDudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs \\nwould carry him. But the long silence from Ron and \\nHermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the \\nmagical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its \\nappeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten \\nhis birthday. \\n\\nWhat wouldn’t he give now for a message from \\nHogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He’d almost be \\n\\nPage | 9 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nglad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to \\nbe sure it hadn’t all been a dream. ... \\n\\nNot that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At \\nthe very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face \\nwith none other than Lord Voldemort himself. \\nVoldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he \\nwas still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to \\nregain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s \\nclutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow \\nescape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking \\nin the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where \\nVoldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his \\nwide, mad eyes — \\n\\nHarry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. \\nHe had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge \\n— and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous \\ngreen eyes had appeared among the leaves. \\n\\nHarry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated \\nacross the lawn. \\n\\n“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward \\nhim. \\n\\nThe huge eyes blinked and vanished. \\n\\n“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot \\nwhere they had been. \\n\\n“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right \\nup to him. \\n\\n“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the \\ndays of the week.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 10 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come \\nyou haven’t got any cards? Haven’t you even got \\nfriends at that freak place?” \\n\\n“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my \\nschool,” said Harry coolly. \\n\\nDudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping \\ndown his fat bottom. \\n\\n“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said \\nsuspiciously. \\n\\n“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to \\nset it on fire,” said Harry. \\n\\nDudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic \\non his fat face. \\n\\n“You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic \\n— he said hell chuck you out of the house — and you \\nhaven’t got anywhere else to go — you haven’t got any \\nfriends to take you — ” \\n\\n“ Jiggery pokeryV ’ said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus \\npocus — squiggly wiggly — ” \\n\\n“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet \\nas he dashed back toward the house. “MUUUUM! \\n\\nHe’s doing you know what!” \\n\\nHarry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither \\nDudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt \\nPetunia knew he hadn’t really done magic, but he still \\nhad to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head \\nwith the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to \\ndo, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d \\nfinished. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 11 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice \\ncream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, \\nmowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and \\nwatered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. \\nThe sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his \\nneck. Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s \\nbait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had \\nbeen thinking himself ... maybe he didn’t have any \\nfriends at Hogwarts. ... \\n\\nWish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he \\nthought savagely as he spread manure on the flower \\nbeds, his back aching, sweat running down his face. \\n\\nIt was half past seven in the evening when at last, \\nexhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him. \\n\\n“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!” \\n\\nHarry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming \\nkitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: \\na huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. \\nA loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. \\n\\n“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped \\nAunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a \\nlump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already \\nwearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. \\n\\nHarry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful \\nsupper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia \\nwhisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!” \\n\\nAs he passed the door to the living room, Harry \\ncaught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow \\nties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the \\nupstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle \\nVernon’s furious face appeared at the foot of the \\nstairs. \\n\\nPage | 12 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Remember, boy — one sound — ” \\n\\nHarry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped \\ninside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his \\nbed. \\n\\nThe trouble was, there was already someone sitting \\non it. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 13 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDOBBY’S WARNING \\n\\nHarry managed not to shout out, but it was a close \\nthing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat- \\nlike ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis \\nballs. Harry knew instantly that this was what had \\nbeen watching him out of the garden hedge that \\nmorning. \\n\\nAs they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s \\nvoice from the hall. \\n\\n“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?” \\n\\nThe creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low \\nthat the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. \\nHarry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an \\nold pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. \\n\\n“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously. \\n\\n“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched \\nvoice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. “So \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 14 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nlong has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir ... Such an \\nhonor it is. ...” \\n\\n“Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along the wall and \\nsinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was \\nasleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, “What are \\nyou?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead \\nhe said, “Who are you?” \\n\\n“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said \\nthe creature. \\n\\n“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be \\nrude or anything, but — this isn’t a great time for me \\nto have a house-elf in my bedroom.” \\n\\nAunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the \\nliving room. The elf hung his head. \\n\\n“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry \\nquickly, “but, er, is there any particular reason you’re \\nhere?” \\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come \\nto tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders \\nwhere to begin. ...” \\n\\n“Sit down,” said Harry politely, pointing at the bed. \\n\\nTo his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy \\ntears. \\n\\n“S-sit down).” he wailed. “Never ... never ever ...” \\n\\nHarry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter. \\n\\n“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to offend you \\nor anything — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 15 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Offend Dobby!” choked the elf. “Dobby has never \\nbeen asked to sit down by a wizard — like an equal — \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, trying to say “Shh!” and look comforting at the \\nsame time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where \\nhe sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly \\ndoll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat \\nwith his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of \\nwatery adoration. \\n\\n“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said \\nHarry, trying to cheer him up. \\n\\nDobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he \\nleapt up and started banging his head furiously on \\nthe window, shouting, “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!” \\n\\n“Don’t — what are you doing?” Harry hissed, \\nspringing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed — \\nHedwig had woken up with a particularly loud \\nscreech and was beating her wings wildly against the \\nbars of her cage. \\n\\n“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who \\nhad gone slightly cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill \\nof his family, sir. ...” \\n\\n“Your family?” \\n\\n“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. ... Dobby is a \\nhouse-elf — bound to serve one house and one family \\nforever. ...” \\n\\n“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously. \\nDobby shuddered. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 16 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself \\nmost grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will \\nhave to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they \\never knew, sir — ” \\n\\n“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the \\noven door?” \\n\\n“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to \\npunish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get \\non with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do \\nextra punishments. ...” \\n\\n“But why don’t you leave? Escape?” \\n\\n“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will \\nnever set Dobby free . . . Dobby will serve the family \\nuntil he dies, sir. ...” \\n\\nHarry stared. \\n\\n“And I thought I had it bad staying here for another \\nfour weeks,” he said. “This makes the Dursleys sound \\nalmost human. Can’t anyone help you? Can’t I?” \\n\\nAlmost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken. \\n\\nDobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude. \\n\\n“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet. \\nIf the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you’re \\nhere — ” \\n\\n“Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . Dobby has \\nheard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, \\nDobby never knew. ...” \\n\\nHarry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \\n“Whatever you’ve heard about my greatness is a load \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 17 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof rubbish. I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; \\nthat’s Hermione, she — ” \\n\\nBut he stopped quickly, because thinking about \\nHermione was painful. \\n\\n“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby \\nreverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. “Harry Potter \\nspeaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be- \\nNamed — ” \\n\\n“Voldemort?” said Harry. \\n\\nDobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and \\nmoaned, “Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the \\nname!” \\n\\n“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people \\ndon’t like it. My friend Ron — ” \\n\\nHe stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, \\ntoo. \\n\\nDobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as \\nheadlights. \\n\\n“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry \\nPotter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just \\nweeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped yet again.” \\n\\nHarry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with \\ntears. \\n\\n“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of \\nthe grubby pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter \\nis valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers \\nalready! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, \\nto warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 18 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe oven door later. . . . Harry Potter must not go back \\nto Hogwarts.” \\n\\nThere was a silence broken only by the chink of \\nknives and forks from downstairs and the distant \\nrumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice. \\n\\n“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back \\n— term starts on September first. It’s all that’s \\nkeeping me going. You don’t know what it’s like here. \\n\\nI don’t belong here. I belong in your world — at \\nHogwarts.” \\n\\n“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so \\nhard his ears flapped. “Harry Potter must stay where \\nhe is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry \\nPotter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal \\ndanger.” \\n\\n“Why?” said Harry in surprise. \\n\\n“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most \\nterrible things happen at Hogwarts School of \\nWitchcraft and Wizardry this year,” whispered Dobby, \\nsuddenly trembling all over. “Dobby has known it for \\nmonths, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in \\nperil. He is too important, sir!” \\n\\n“What terrible things?” said Harry at once. “Who’s \\nplotting them?” \\n\\nDobby made a funny choking noise and then banged \\nhis head frantically against the wall. \\n\\n“All right!” cried Harry, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop \\nhim. “You can’t tell me. I understand. But why are \\nyou warning me?” A sudden, unpleasant thought \\nstruck him. “Hang on — this hasn’t got anything to \\ndo with Vol — sorry — with You-Know-Who, has it? \\nPage | 19 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou could just shake or nod,” he added hastily as \\nDobby’s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again. \\n\\nSlowly, Dobby shook his head. \\n\\n“Not — not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir — ” \\n\\nBut Dobby’s eyes were wide and he seemed to be \\ntrying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was \\ncompletely lost. \\n\\n“He hasn’t got a brother, has he?” \\n\\nDobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever. \\n\\n“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a \\nchance of making horrible things happen at \\nHogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore, \\nfor one thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t \\nyou?” \\n\\nDobby bowed his head. \\n\\n“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster \\nHogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby \\nhas heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of He- \\nWho-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his \\nstrength. But, sir” — Dobby’s voice dropped to an \\nurgent whisper — “there are powers Dumbledore \\ndoesn’t ... powers no decent wizard ...” \\n\\nAnd before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off \\nthe bed, seized Harry’s desk lamp, and started \\nbeating himself around the head with earsplitting \\nyelps. \\n\\nA sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later \\nHarry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 20 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncoming into the hall, calling, “Dudley must have left \\nhis television on again, the little tyke!” \\n\\n“Quick! In the closet!” hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby \\nin, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the \\nbed just as the door handle turned. \\n\\n“What — the — devil — are — you — doing?” said \\nUncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly \\nclose to Harry’s. “You’ve just ruined the punch line of \\nmy Japanese golfer joke. ... One more sound and \\nyou’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!” \\n\\nHe stomped flat-footed from the room. \\n\\nShaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet. \\n\\n“See what it’s like here?” he said. “See why I’ve got to \\ngo back to Hogwarts? It’s the only place I’ve got — \\nwell, I think I’ve got friends.” \\n\\n“Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?” said \\nDobby slyly. \\n\\n“I expect they’ve just been — wait a minute,” said \\nHarry, frowning. “How do you know my friends \\nhaven’t been writing to me?” \\n\\nDobby shuffled his feet. \\n\\n“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Dobby \\ndid it for the best — ” \\n\\n“Have you been stopping my letters?” \\n\\n“Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf. Stepping \\nnimbly out of Harry’s reach, he pulled a thick wad of \\nenvelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was \\nwearing. Harry could make out Hermione’s neat \\n\\nPage | 21 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwriting, Ron’s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that \\nlooked as though it was from the Hogwarts \\ngamekeeper, Hagrid. \\n\\nDobby blinked anxiously up at Harry. \\n\\n“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry. ... Dobby hoped ... if \\nHarry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him . . . \\nHarry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry wasn’t listening. He made a grab for the letters, \\nbut Dobby jumped out of reach. \\n\\n“Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his \\nword that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this \\nis a danger you must not face! Say you won’t go back, \\nsir!” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry angrily. “Give me my friends’ letters!” \\n\\n“Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,” said the \\nelf sadly. \\n\\nBefore Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the \\nbedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the \\nstairs. \\n\\nMouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, \\ntrying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six \\nsteps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking \\naround for Dobby. From the dining room he heard \\nUncle Vernon saying, \"... tell Petunia that very funny \\nstory about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. \\nShe’s been dying to hear ...” \\n\\nHarry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his \\nstomach disappear. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 22 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAunt Petunia’s masterpiece of a pudding, the \\nmountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating \\nup near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the \\ncorner crouched Dobby. \\n\\n“No,” croaked Harry. “Please ... they’ll kill me. ...” \\n“Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school \\n\\n\\n\\n“Dobby ... please ...” \\n\\n“Say it, sir — ” \\n\\n“I can’t — ” \\n\\nDobby gave him a tragic look. \\n\\n“Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own \\ngood.” \\n\\nThe pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping \\ncrash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the \\ndish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby \\nvanished. \\n\\nThere were screams from the dining room and Uncle \\nVernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with \\nshock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia’s \\npudding. \\n\\nAt first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would \\nmanage to gloss the whole thing over. (“Just our \\nnephew — very disturbed — meeting strangers upsets \\nhim, so we kept him upstairs. ...”) He shooed the \\nshocked Masons back into the dining room, promised \\nHarry he would flay him to within an inch of his life \\nwhen the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. \\nAunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer \\nPage | 23 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the \\nkitchen clean. \\n\\nUncle Vernon might still have been able to make his \\ndeal — if it hadn’t been for the owl. \\n\\nAunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after- \\ndinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through \\nthe dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. \\nMason’s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason \\nscreamed like a banshee and ran from the house \\nshouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long \\nenough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally \\nafraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask \\nwhether this was their idea of a joke. \\n\\nHarry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for \\nsupport, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a \\ndemonic glint in his tiny eyes. \\n\\n“Read it!” he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the \\nowl had delivered. “Go on — read it!” \\n\\nHarry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings. \\n\\nDear Mr. Potter, \\n\\nWe have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was \\nused at your place of residence this evening at twelve \\nminutes past nine. \\n\\nAs you know, underage wizards are not permitted to \\nperform spells outside school, and further spellwork on \\nyour part may lead to expulsion from said school \\n(Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage \\nSorcery, 1875, Paragraph C). \\n\\nWe would also ask you to remember that any magical \\nactivity that risks notice by members of the non- \\n\\nP a g e | 24 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmagical community (Muggles) is a serious offense \\nunder section 13 of the International Confederation of \\nWarlocks’ Statute of Secrecy. \\n\\nEnjoy your holidays! \\n\\nYours sincerely, \\n\\nMafalda Hopkirk \\n\\nIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE \\nMinistry of Magic \\n\\nHarry looked up from the letter and gulped. \\n\\n“You didn’t tell us you weren’t allowed to use magic \\noutside school,” said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam \\ndancing in his eyes. “Forgot to mention it. ... Slipped \\nyour mind, I daresay. ...” \\n\\nHe was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, \\nall his teeth bared. “Well, I’ve got news for you, boy. ... \\nI’m locking you up. ... You’re never going back to that \\nschool . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself \\nout — they 11 expel you!” \\n\\nAnd laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back \\nupstairs. \\n\\nUncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following \\nmorning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window. \\nHe himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so \\nthat small amounts of food could be pushed inside \\nthree times a day. They let Harry out to use the \\nbathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was \\nlocked in his room around the clock. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 25 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThree days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign \\nof relenting, and Harry couldn’t see any way out of his \\nsituation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking \\nbehind the bars on the window and wondered \\nmiserably what was going to happen to him. \\n\\nWhat was the good of magicking himself out of his \\nroom if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life \\nat Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that \\nthe Dursleys knew they weren’t going to wake up as \\nfruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might \\nhave saved Harry from horrible happenings at \\nHogwarts, but the way things were going, he’d \\nprobably starve to death anyway. \\n\\nThe cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia’s hand \\nappeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the \\nroom. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, \\njumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone- \\ncold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he \\ncrossed the room to Hedwig’s cage and tipped the \\nsoggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her \\nempty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave \\nhim a look of deep disgust. \\n\\n“It’s no good turning your beak up at it — that’s all \\nwe’ve got,” said Harry grimly. \\n\\nHe put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the \\ncat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even \\nhungrier than he had been before the soup. \\n\\nSupposing he was still alive in another four weeks, \\nwhat would happen if he didn’t turn up at Hogwarts? \\nWould someone be sent to see why he hadn’t come \\nback? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let \\nhim go? \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 26 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach \\nrumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable \\nquestions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep. \\n\\nHe dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card \\nreading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. \\nPeople goggled through the bars at him as he lay, \\nstarving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby’s \\nface in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, \\nbut Dobby called, “Harry Potter is safe there, sir!” and \\nvanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley \\nrattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him. \\n\\n“Stop it,” Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in \\nhis sore head. “Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I’m \\ntrying to sleep. ...” \\n\\nHe opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through \\nthe bars on the window. And someone was goggling \\nthrough the bars at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired, \\nlong-nosed someone. \\n\\nRon Weasley was outside Harry’s window. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 27 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BURROW \\n\\n“Ron\\\\” breathed Harry, creeping to the window and \\npushing it up so they could talk through the bars. \\n“Ron, how did you — What the — ?” \\n\\nHarry’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he \\nwas seeing hit him. Ron was leaning out of the back \\nwindow of an old turquoise car, which was parked in \\nmidair. Grinning at Harry from the front seats were \\nFred and George, Ron’s elder twin brothers. \\n\\n“All right, Harry?” asked George. \\n\\n“What’s been going on?” said Ron. “Why haven’t you \\nbeen answering my letters? I’ve asked you to stay \\nabout twelve times, and then Dad came home and \\nsaid you’d got an official warning for using magic in \\nfront of Muggles — ” \\n\\n“It wasn’t me — and how did he know?” \\n\\n“He works for the Ministry,” said Ron. “You know \\nwe’re not supposed to do spells outside school — ” \\n\\nPage | 28 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“You should talk,” said Harry, staring at the floating \\ncar. \\n\\n“Oh, this doesn’t count,” said Ron. “We’re only \\nborrowing this. It’s Dad’s, we didn’t enchant it. But \\ndoing magic in front of those Muggles you live with — ” \\n\\n“I told you, I didn’t — but it’ll take too long to explain \\nnow — look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the \\nDursleys have locked me up and won’t let me come \\nback, and obviously I can’t magic myself out, because \\nthe Ministry’ll think that’s the second spell I’ve done \\nin three days, so — ” \\n\\n“Stop gibbering,” said Ron. “We’ve come to take you \\nhome with us.” \\n\\n“But you can’t magic me out either — ” \\n\\n“We don’t need to,” said Ron, jerking his head toward \\nthe front seat and grinning. “You forget who I’ve got \\nwith me.” \\n\\n“Tie that around the bars,” said Fred, throwing the \\nend of a rope to Harry. \\n\\n“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he \\ntied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up \\nthe car. \\n\\n“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.” \\n\\nHarry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, \\nwho seemed to have realized how important this was \\nand kept still and silent. The car revved louder and \\nlouder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the \\nbars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred \\ndrove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the \\nwindow to see the bars dangling a few feet above the \\nPage | 29 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. \\nHarry listened anxiously, but there was no sound \\nfrom the Dursleys’ bedroom. \\n\\nWhen the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, \\nFred reversed as close as possible to Harry’s window. \\n\\n“Get in,” Ron said. \\n\\n“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my \\nbroomstick — ” \\n\\n“Where is it?” \\n\\n“Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t \\nget out of this room — ” \\n\\n“No problem,” said George from the front passenger \\nseat. “Out of the way, Harry.” \\n\\nFred and George climbed catlike through the window \\ninto Harry’s room. You had to hand it to them, \\nthought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin \\nfrom his pocket and started to pick the lock. \\n\\n“A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing \\nthis sort of Muggle trick,” said Fred, “but we feel \\nthey’re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit \\nslow.” \\n\\nThere was a small click and the door swung open. \\n\\n“So — we’ll get your trunk — you grab anything you \\nneed from your room and hand it out to Ron,” \\nwhispered George. \\n\\n“Watch out for the bottom stair — it creaks,” Harry \\nwhispered back as the twins disappeared onto the \\ndark landing. \\n\\nPage | 30 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry dashed around his room, collecting his things \\nand passing them out of the window to Ron. Then he \\nwent to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the \\nstairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough. \\n\\nAt last, panting, they reached the landing, then \\ncarried the trunk through Harry’s room to the open \\nwindow. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with \\nRon, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom \\nside. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window. \\n\\nUncle Vernon coughed again. \\n\\n“A bit more,” panted Fred, who was pulling from \\ninside the car. “One good push — ” \\n\\nHarry and George threw their shoulders against the \\ntrunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat \\nof the car. \\n\\n“Okay, let’s go,” George whispered. \\n\\nBut as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came \\na sudden loud screech from behind him, followed \\nimmediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon’s voice. \\n\\n“THAT RUDDY OWL!” \\n\\n“I’ve forgotten Hedwig!” \\n\\nHarry tore back across the room as the landing light \\nclicked on — he snatched up Hedwig’s cage, dashed \\nto the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was \\nscrambling back onto the chest of drawers when \\nUncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door — and \\nit crashed open. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 31 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the \\ndoorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull \\nand dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle. \\n\\nRon, Fred, and George seized Harry’s arms and pulled \\nas hard as they could. \\n\\n“Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “He’s getting away! \\nHE’S GETTING AWAY!” \\n\\nBut the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry’s leg \\nslid out of Uncle Vernon’s grasp — Harry was in the \\ncar — he’d slammed the door shut — \\n\\n“Put your foot down, Fred!” yelled Ron, and the car \\nshot suddenly toward the moon. \\n\\nHarry couldn’t believe it — he was free. He rolled \\ndown the window, the night air whipping his hair, \\nand looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet \\nDrive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were \\nall hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry’s window. \\n\\n“See you next summer!” Harry yelled. \\n\\nThe Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled \\nback in his seat, grinning from ear to ear. \\n\\n“Let Hedwig out,” he told Ron. “She can fly behind us. \\nShe hasn’t had a chance to stretch her wings for \\nages.” \\n\\nGeorge handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment \\nlater, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to \\nglide alongside them like a ghost. \\n\\n“So — what’s the story, Harry?” said Ron impatiently. \\n“What’s been happening?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 32 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d \\ngiven Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. \\nThere was a long, shocked silence when he had \\nfinished. \\n\\n“Very fishy,” said Fred finally. \\n\\n“Definitely dodgy,” agreed George. “So he wouldn’t \\neven tell you who’s supposed to be plotting all this \\nstuff?” \\n\\n“I don’t think he could,” said Harry. “I told you, every \\ntime he got close to letting something slip, he started \\nbanging his head against the wall.” \\n\\nHe saw Fred and George look at each other. \\n\\n“What, you think he was lying to me?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Well,” said Fred, “put it this way — house-elves have \\ngot powerful magic of their own, but they can’t \\nusually use it without their master’s permission. I \\nreckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back \\nto Hogwarts. Someone’s idea of a joke. Can you think \\nof anyone at school with a grudge against you?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry and Ron together, instantly. \\n\\n“Draco Malfoy,” Harry explained. “He hates me.” \\n\\n“Draco Malfoy?” said George, turning around. “Not \\nLucius Malfoy’s son?” \\n\\n“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said \\nHarry. “Why?” \\n\\n“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He \\nwas a big supporter of You-Know-Who.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 33 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, \\ncraning around to look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came \\nback saying he’d never meant any of it. Load of dung \\n— Dad reckons he was right in You-Know- Who’s \\ninner circle.” \\n\\nHarry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family \\nbefore, and they didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy \\nmade Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, \\nand sensitive boy. \\n\\n“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. \\n\\n...” said Harry. \\n\\n“Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding \\nfamily, and they’ll be rich,” said Fred. \\n\\n“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to \\ndo the ironing,” said George. “But all we’ve got is a \\nlousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the \\ngarden. House-elves come with big old manors and \\ncastles and places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in \\nour house. ...” \\n\\nHarry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco \\nMalfoy usually had the best of everything, his family \\nwas rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy \\nstrutting around a large manor house. Sending the \\nfamily servant to stop Harry from going back to \\nHogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing \\nMalfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take \\nDobby seriously? \\n\\n“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I \\nwas getting really worried when you didn’t answer \\nany of my letters. I thought it was Errol’s fault at first \\n\\n\\n\\n“Who’s Errol?” \\n\\nPage | 34 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Our owl. He’s ancient. It wouldn’t be the first time \\nhe’d collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow \\nHermes — ” \\n\\n“Who?” \\n\\n“The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was \\nmade prefect,” said Fred from the front. \\n\\n“But Percy wouldn’t lend him to me,” said Ron. “Said \\nhe needed him.” \\n\\n“Percy’s been acting very oddly this summer,” said \\nGeorge, frowning. “And he has been sending a lot of \\nletters and spending a load of time shut up in his \\nroom. ... I mean, there’s only so many times you can \\npolish a prefect badge. ... You’re driving too far west, \\nFred,” he added, pointing at a compass on the \\ndashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel. \\n\\n“So, does your dad know you’ve got the car?” said \\nHarry, guessing the answer. \\n\\n“Er, no,” said Ron, “he had to work tonight. Hopefully \\nwe’ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum \\nnoticing we flew it.” \\n\\n“What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, \\nanyway?” \\n\\n“He works in the most boring department,” said Ron. \\n“The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.” \\n\\n“The what?” \\n\\n“It’s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle- \\nmade, you know, in case they end up back in a \\nMuggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch \\ndied and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. \\n\\nPage | 35 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried \\nto serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare — \\nDad was working overtime for weeks.” \\n\\n“What happened?” \\n\\n“The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all \\nover the place and one man ended up in the hospital \\nwith the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was \\ngoing frantic — it’s only him and an old warlock \\ncalled Perkins in the office — and they had to do \\nMemory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up — \\n\\n\\n\\n“But your dad — this car — ” \\n\\nFred laughed. “Yeah, Dad’s crazy about everything to \\ndo with Muggles; our shed’s full of Muggle stuff. He \\ntakes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back \\ntogether again. If he raided our house he’d have to put \\nhimself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.” \\n\\n“That’s the main road,” said George, peering down \\nthrough the windshield. “We’ll be there in ten \\nminutes. ... Just as well, it’s getting light. ...” \\n\\nA faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to \\nthe east. \\n\\nFred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark \\npatchwork of fields and clumps of trees. \\n\\n“We’re a little way outside the village,” said George. \\n“Ottery St. Catchpole.” \\n\\nLower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a \\nbrilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 36 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Touchdown!” said Fred as, with a slight bump, they \\nhit the ground. They had landed next to a \\ntumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked \\nout for the first time at Ron’s house. \\n\\nIt looked as though it had once been a large stone \\npigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and \\nthere until it was several stories high and so crooked \\nit looked as though it were held up by magic (which, \\nHarry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five \\nchimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A \\nlopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance \\nread, THE BURROW. Around the front door lay a \\njumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. \\nSeveral fat brown chickens were pecking their way \\naround the yard. \\n\\n“It’s not much,” said Ron. \\n\\n“It’s wonderful,” said Harry happily, thinking of Privet \\nDrive. \\n\\nThey got out of the car. \\n\\n“Now, we’ll go upstairs really quietly,” said Fred, “and \\nwait for Mum to call us for breakfast. Then, Ron, you \\ncome bounding downstairs going, ‘Mum, look who \\nturned up in the night!’ and she’ll be all pleased to \\nsee Harry and no one need ever know we flew the \\ncar.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Ron. “Come on, Harry, I sleep at the — \\nat the top — ” \\n\\nRon had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on \\nthe house. The other three wheeled around. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, \\nscattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind- \\n\\nP a g e | 37 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfaced woman, it was remarkable how much she \\nlooked like a saber-toothed tiger. \\n\\n“Ah,” said Fred. \\n\\n“Oh, dear,” said George. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her \\nhands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the \\nnext. She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand \\nsticking out of the pocket. \\n\\n“So,” she said. \\n\\n“ ’Morning, Mum,” said George, in what he clearly \\nthought was a jaunty, winning voice. \\n\\n“Have you any idea how worried I’ve been?” said Mrs. \\nWeasley in a deadly whisper. \\n\\n“Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to — ” \\n\\nAll three of Mrs. Weasley’s sons were taller than she \\nwas, but they cowered as her rage broke over them. \\n\\n“Beds empty\\\\ No note\\\\ Car gone — could have crashed \\n— out of my mind with worry — did you care? — \\nnever, as long as I’ve lived — you wait until your father \\ngets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or \\nCharlie or Percy — ” \\n\\n“Perfect Percy,” muttered Fred. \\n\\n“YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF \\nPERCY’S BOOK!” yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a \\nfinger in Fred’s chest. “You could havedied, you could \\nhave been seen, you could have lost your father his \\njob \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 38 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had \\nshouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, \\nwho backed away. \\n\\n“I’m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,” she said. \\n“Come in and have some breakfast.” \\n\\nShe turned and walked back into the house and \\nHarry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded \\nencouragingly, followed her. \\n\\nThe kitchen was small and rather cramped. There \\nwas a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the \\nmiddle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, \\nlooking around. He had never been in a wizard house \\nbefore. \\n\\nThe clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand \\nand no numbers at all. Written around the edge were \\nthings like Time to make tea, Time to feed the \\nchickens, and You’re late. Books were stacked three \\ndeep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm \\nYour Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One \\nMinute Feasts — It’s Magid And unless Harry’s ears \\nwere deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had \\njust announced that coming up was “Witching Hour, \\nwith the popular singing sorceress, Celestina \\nWarbeck.” \\n\\nMrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking \\nbreakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at \\nher sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan. \\nEvery now and then she muttered things like “don’t \\nknow what you were thinking of,” and “never would \\nhave believed it.” \\n\\n“I don’t blame you, dear,” she assured Harry, tipping \\neight or nine sausages onto his plate. “Arthur and I \\nhave been worried about you, too. Just last night we \\n\\nPage | 39 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwere saying we’d come and get you ourselves if you \\nhadn’t written back to Ron by Friday. But really” (she \\nwas now adding three fried eggs to his plate), “flying \\nan illegal car halfway across the country — anyone \\ncould have seen you — ” \\n\\nShe flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the \\nsink, which began to clean themselves, clinking \\ngently in the background. \\n\\n“It was cloudy, Mum!” said Fred. \\n\\n“You keep your mouth closed while you’re eating!” \\nMrs. Weasley snapped. \\n\\n“They were starving him, Mum!” said George. \\n\\n“And you!” said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a \\nslightly softened expression that she started cutting \\nHarry bread and buttering it for him. \\n\\nAt that moment there was a diversion in the form of a \\nsmall, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who \\nappeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran \\nout again. \\n\\n“Ginny,” said Ron in an undertone to Harry. “My \\nsister. She’s been talking about you all summer.” \\n\\n“Yeah, she’ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,” Fred \\nsaid with a grin, but he caught his mother’s eye and \\nbent his face over his plate without another word. \\nNothing more was said until all four plates were \\nclean, which took a surprisingly short time. \\n\\n“Blimey, I’m tired,” yawned Fred, setting down his \\nknife and fork at last. “I think I’ll go to bed and — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 40 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You will not,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “It’s your own \\nfault you’ve been up all night. You’re going to de- \\ngnome the garden for me; they’re getting completely \\nout of hand again — ” \\n\\n“Oh, Mum — ” \\n\\n“And you two,” she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \\n\\n“You can go up to bed, dear,” she added to Harry. \\n\\n“You didn’t ask them to fly that wretched car — ” \\n\\nBut Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, “I’ll help \\nRon. I’ve never seen a de-gnoming — ” \\n\\n“That’s very sweet of you, dear, but it’s dull work,” \\nsaid Mrs. Weasley. “Now, let’s see what Lockhart’s got \\nto say on the subject — ” \\n\\nAnd she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the \\nmantelpiece. George groaned. \\n\\n“Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden — ” \\n\\nHarry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley’s book. \\nWritten across it in fancy gold letters were the words \\nGilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests. There \\nwas a big photograph on the front of a very good- \\nlooking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue \\neyes. As always in the wizarding world, the \\nphotograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry \\nsupposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking \\ncheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down \\nat him. \\n\\n“Oh, he is marvelous,” she said. “He knows his \\nhousehold pests, all right, it’s a wonderful book. ...” \\n\\n“Mum fancies him,” said Fred, in a very audible \\nwhisper. \\n\\nPage | 41 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t be so ridiculous, Fred,” said Mrs. Weasley, her \\ncheeks rather pink. “All right, if you think you know \\nbetter than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, \\nand woe betide you if there’s a single gnome in that \\ngarden when I come out to inspect it.” \\n\\nYawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched \\noutside with Harry behind them. The garden was \\nlarge, and in Harry’s eyes, exactly what a garden \\nshould be. The Dursleys wouldn’t have liked it — \\nthere were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed \\ncutting — but there were gnarled trees all around the \\nwalls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every \\nflower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs. \\n\\n“Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,” Harry \\ntold Ron as they crossed the lawn. \\n\\n“Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes,” \\nsaid Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, \\n“like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods. ...” \\n\\nThere was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush \\nshuddered, and Ron straightened up. “ This is a \\ngnome,” he said grimly. \\n\\n“Gerroff me! Gerroff me!” squealed the gnome. \\n\\nIt was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small \\nand leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head \\nexactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm’s length as it \\nkicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped \\nit around the ankles and turned it upside down. \\n\\n“This is what you have to do,” he said. He raised the \\ngnome above his head (“Gerroff me!”) and started to \\nswing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the \\nshocked look on Harry’s face, Ron added, “It doesn’t \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 42 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhurt them — you’ve just got to make them really dizzy \\nso they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes.” \\n\\n\\n\\nHe let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet \\ninto the air and landed with a thud in the field over \\nthe hedge. \\n\\n“Pitiful,” said Fred. “I bet I can get mine beyond that \\nstump.” \\n\\nHarry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the \\ngnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he \\ncaught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing \\nweakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry’s \\nfinger and he had a hard job shaking it off — until — \\n\\n“Wow, Harry — that must’ve been fifty feet. ...” \\n\\nThe air was soon thick with flying gnomes. \\n\\n“See, they’re not too bright,” said George, seizing five \\nor six gnomes at once. “The moment they know the \\nde-gnoming’s going on they storm up to have a look. \\nYou’d think they’d have learned by now just to stay \\nput.” \\n\\nSoon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking \\naway in a straggling line, their little shoulders \\nhunched. \\n\\n“They’ll be back,” said Ron as they watched the \\ngnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of \\nthe field. “They love it here. ... Dad’s too soft with \\nthem; he thinks they’re funny. ...” \\n\\nJust then, the front door slammed. \\n\\n“He’s back!” said George. “Dad’s home!” \\n\\nPage | 43 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey hurried through the garden and back into the \\nhouse. \\n\\nMr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his \\nglasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, \\ngoing bald, but the little hair he had was as red as \\nany of his children’s. He was wearing long green \\nrobes, which were dusty and travel-worn. \\n\\n“What a night,” he mumbled, groping for the teapot as \\nthey all sat down around him. “Nine raids. Nine! And \\nold Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me \\nwhen I had my back turned. ...” \\n\\nMr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed. \\n\\n“Find anything, Dad?” said Fred eagerly. \\n\\n“All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting \\nkettle,” yawned Mr. Weasley. “There was some pretty \\nnasty stuff that wasn’t my department, though. \\nMortlake was taken away for questioning about some \\nextremely odd ferrets, but that’s the Committee on \\nExperimental Charms, thank goodness. ...” \\n\\n“Why would anyone bother making door keys \\nshrink?” said George. \\n\\n“Just Muggle-baiting,” sighed Mr. Weasley. “Sell them \\na key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can \\nnever find it when they need it. ... Of course, it’s very \\nhard to convict anyone because no Muggle would \\nadmit their key keeps shrinking — they’ll insist they \\njust keep losing it. Bless them, they’ll go to any \\nlengths to ignore magic, even if it’s staring them in \\nthe face. ... But the things our lot have taken to \\nenchanting, you wouldn’t believe — ” \\n\\n“LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?” \\n\\nPage | 44 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like \\na sword. Mr. Weasley’s eyes jerked open. He stared \\nguiltily at his wife. \\n\\n“C-cars, Molly, dear?” \\n\\n“Yes, Arthur, cars,” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes \\nflashing. “Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and \\ntelling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it \\napart to see how it worked, while really he was \\nenchanting it to make it fly.” \\n\\nMr. Weasley blinked. \\n\\n“Well, dear, I think you’ll find that he would be quite \\nwithin the law to do that, even if — er — he maybe \\nwould have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth. \\n... There’s a loophole in the law, you’ll find. ... As long \\nas he wasn’t intending to fly the car, the fact that the \\ncar could fly wouldn’t — ” \\n\\n“Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole \\nwhen you wrote that law!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. \\n“Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that \\nMuggle rubbish in your shed! And for your \\ninformation, Harry arrived this morning in the car \\nyou weren’t intending to fly!” \\n\\n“Harry?” said Mr. Weasley blankly. “Harry who?” \\n\\nHe looked around, saw Harry, and jumped. \\n\\n“Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet \\nyou, Ron’s told us so much about — ” \\n\\n“ Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back \\nlast nighti” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “What have you got \\nto say about that, eh?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 45 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Did it go \\nall right? I — I mean,” he faltered as sparks flew from \\nMrs. Weasley’s eyes, “that — that was very wrong, \\nboys — very wrong indeed. ...” \\n\\n“Let’s leave them to it,” Ron muttered to Harry as \\nMrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. “Come on, I’ll \\nshow you my bedroom.” \\n\\nThey slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow \\npassageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its \\nway, zigzagging up through the house. On the third \\nlanding, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of \\na pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it \\nclosed with a snap. \\n\\n“Ginny,” said Ron. “You don’t know how weird it is for \\nher to be this shy. She never shuts up normally — ” \\n\\nThey climbed two more flights until they reached a \\ndoor with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, \\nsaying RONALD’S ROOM. \\n\\nHarry stepped in, his head almost touching the \\nsloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a \\nfurnace: Nearly everything in Ron’s room seemed to \\nbe a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, \\neven the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had \\ncovered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper \\nwith posters of the same seven witches and wizards, \\nall wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, \\nand waving energetically. \\n\\n“Your Quidditch team?” said Harry. \\n\\n“The Chudley Cannons,” said Ron, pointing at the \\norange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two \\ngiant black C’s and a speeding cannonball. “Ninth in \\nthe league.” \\n\\nPage | 46 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon’s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a \\ncorner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to \\nfeature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad \\nMuggle. Ron’s magic wand was lying on top of a fish \\ntank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his \\nfat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of \\nsun. \\n\\nHarry stepped over a pack of Self- Shuffling playing \\ncards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. \\nIn the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes \\nsneaking one by one back through the Weasleys’ \\nhedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was \\nwatching him almost nervously, as though waiting for \\nhis opinion. \\n\\n“It’s a bit small,” said Ron quickly. “Not like that room \\nyou had with the Muggles. And I’m right underneath \\nthe ghoul in the attic; he’s always banging on the \\npipes and groaning. ...” \\n\\nBut Harry, grinning widely, said, “This is the best \\nhouse I’ve ever been in.” \\n\\nRon’s ears went pink. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 47 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS \\n\\nLife at the Burrow was as different as possible from \\nlife on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything \\nneat and ordered; the Weasleys’ house burst with the \\nstrange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first \\ntime he looked in the mirror over the kitchen \\nmantelpiece and it shouted, “ Tuck your shirt in, \\nscruff yV’ The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped \\npipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, \\nand small explosions from Fred and George’s \\nbedroom were considered perfectly normal. What \\nHarry found most unusual about life at Ron’s, \\nhowever, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking \\nghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to \\nlike him. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and \\ntried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. \\nMr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the \\ndinner table so that he could bombard him with \\nquestions about life with Muggles, asking him to \\nexplain how things like plugs and the postal service \\nworked. \\n\\nPage | 48 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“ Fascinating !” he would say as Harry talked him \\nthrough using a telephone. “Ingenious, really, how \\nmany ways Muggles have found of getting along \\nwithout magic.” \\n\\nHarry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about \\na week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and \\nRon went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. \\nWeasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen \\ntable. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally \\nknocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud \\nclatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things \\nover whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under \\nthe table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her \\nface glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn’t \\nnoticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. \\nWeasley offered him. \\n\\n“Letters from school,” said Mr. Weasley, passing \\nHarry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish \\nparchment, addressed in green ink. “Dumbledore \\nalready knows you’re here, Harry — doesn’t miss a \\ntrick, that man. You two’ve got them, too,” he added, \\nas Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas. \\n\\nFor a few minutes there was silence as they all read \\ntheir letters. Harry’s told him to catch the Hogwarts \\nExpress as usual from King’s Cross station on \\nSeptember first. There was also a list of the new \\nbooks he’d need for the coming year. \\n\\nSECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE: \\n\\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda \\nGoshawk \\n\\nBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\nGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\nPage | 49 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\nTravels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\nVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\nWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\nYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\nFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at \\nHarry’s. \\n\\n“You’ve been told to get all Lockhart’s books, too!” he \\nsaid. “The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher \\nmust be a fan — bet it’s a witch.” \\n\\nAt this point, Fred caught his mother’s eye and \\nquickly busied himself with the marmalade. \\n\\n“That lot won’t come cheap,” said George, with a \\nquick look at his parents. “Lockhart’s books are really \\nexpensive. ...” \\n\\n“Well, we’ll manage,” said Mrs. Weasley, but she \\nlooked worried. “I expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot \\nof Ginny’s things secondhand.” \\n\\n“Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?” Harry \\nasked Ginny. \\n\\nShe nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, \\nand put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no \\none saw this except Harry, because just then Ron’s \\nelder brother Percy walked in. He was already \\ndressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his \\nsweater vest. \\n\\n“Morning, all,” said Percy briskly. “Lovely day.” \\n\\nPage | 50 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up \\nagain almost immediately, pulling from underneath \\nhim a molting, gray feather duster — at least, that \\nwas what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it \\nwas breathing. \\n\\n“Errol!” said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and \\nextracting a letter from under its wing. “Finally — he’s \\ngot Hermione’s answer. I wrote to her saying we were \\ngoing to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.” \\n\\nHe carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door \\nand tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped \\nstraight off again so Ron laid him on the draining \\nboard instead, muttering, “Pathetic.” Then he ripped \\nopen Hermione’s letter and read it out loud: \\n\\n“ ‘Dear Ron, and Harry if you’re there, \\n\\n“ ‘I hope everything went all right and that Harry is \\nokay and that you didn’t do anything illegal to get him \\nout, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, \\ntoo. I’ve been really worried and if Harry is all right, \\nwill you please let me know at once, but perhaps it \\nwould be better if you used a different owl, because I \\nthink another delivery might finish your one off \\n\\n“ ‘I’m very busy with schoolwork, of course’ — How can \\nshe be?” said Ron in horror. “We’re on vacation! — \\n‘and we’re going to London next Wednesday to buy my \\nnew books. Why don’t we meet in Diagon Alley? \\n\\n“ ‘Let me know what’s happening as soon as you can. \\nLove from Hermione.’ ” \\n\\n“Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your \\nthings then, too,” said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear \\nthe table. “What ’re you all up to today?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 51 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up \\nthe hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It \\nwas surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of \\nthe village below, meaning that they could practice \\nQuidditch there, as long as they didn’t fly too high. \\nThey couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, which would \\nhave been hard to explain if they had escaped and \\nflown away over the village; instead they threw apples \\nfor one another to catch. They took turns riding \\nHarry’s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the \\nbest broom; Ron’s old Shooting Star was often \\noutstripped by passing butterflies. \\n\\nFive minutes later they were marching up the hill, \\nbroomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked \\nPercy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he \\nwas busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so \\nfar; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time. \\n\\n“Wish I knew what he was up to,” said Fred, frowning. \\n“He’s not himself. His exam results came the day \\nbefore you did; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated \\nat all.” \\n\\n“Ordinary Wizarding Levels,” George explained, seeing \\nHarry’s puzzled look. “Bill got twelve, too. If we’re not \\ncareful, we’ll have another Head Boy in the family. I \\ndon’t think I could stand the shame.” \\n\\nBill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next \\nbrother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry \\nhad never met either of them, but knew that Charlie \\nwas in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt \\nworking for the wizard’s bank, Gringotts. \\n\\n“Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our \\nschool stuff this year,” said George after a while. “Five \\nsets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a \\nwand and everything. ...” \\n\\nPage | 52 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in \\nan underground vault at Gringotts in London was a \\nsmall fortune that his parents had left him. Of course, \\nit was only in the wizarding world that he had money; \\nyou couldn’t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in \\nMuggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts \\nbank account to the Dursleys; he didn’t think their \\nhorror of anything connected with magic would \\nstretch to a large pile of gold. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley woke them all early the following \\nWednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon \\nsandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. \\nWeasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece \\nand peered inside. \\n\\n“We’re running low, Arthur,” she sighed. “We’ll have \\nto buy some more today. ... Ah well, guests first! After \\nyou, Harry dear!” \\n\\nAnd she offered him the flowerpot. \\n\\nHarry stared at them all watching him. \\n\\n“W-what am I supposed to do?” he stammered. \\n\\n“He’s never traveled by Floo powder,” said Ron \\nsuddenly. “Sorry, Harry, I forgot.” \\n\\n“Never?” said Mr. Weasley. “But how did you get to \\nDiagon Alley to buy your school things last year?” \\n\\n“I went on the Underground — ” \\n\\n“Really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Were there \\nescapators? How exactly — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 53 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not now, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Floo powder’s \\na lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you’ve never \\nused it before — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“He’ll be all right, Mum,” said Fred. “Harry, watch us \\nfirst.” \\n\\nHe took a pinch of glittering powder out of the \\nflowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the \\npowder into the flames. \\n\\nWith a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose \\nhigher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, \\n“Diagon Alley!” and vanished. \\n\\n“You must speak clearly, dear,” Mrs. Weasley told \\nHarry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot. \\n“And be sure to get out at the right grate. ...” \\n\\n“The right what?” said Harry nervously as the fire \\nroared and whipped George out of sight, too. \\n\\n“Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose \\nfrom, you know, but as long as you’ve spoken clearly \\n\\n\\n\\n“He’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss,” said Mr. Weasley, \\nhelping himself to Floo powder, too. \\n\\n“But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain \\nto his aunt and uncle?” \\n\\n“They wouldn’t mind,” Harry reassured her. “Dudley \\nwould think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a \\nchimney, don’t worry about that — ” \\n\\n“Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,” said Mrs. \\nWeasley. “Now, when you get into the fire, say where \\nyou’re going — ” \\n\\nPage | 54 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And keep your elbows tucked in,” Ron advised. \\n\\n“And your eyes shut,” said Mrs. Weasley. “The soot — \\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t fidget,” said Ron. “Or you might well fall out of \\nthe wrong fireplace — ” \\n\\n“But don’t panic and get out too early; wait until you \\nsee Fred and George.” \\n\\nTrying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a \\npinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the \\nfire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into \\nthe flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a \\nwarm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately \\nswallowed a lot of hot ash. \\n\\n“D-Dia-gon Alley,” he coughed. \\n\\nIt felt as though he were being sucked down a giant \\ndrain. He seemed to be spinning very fast — the \\nroaring in his ears was deafening — he tried to keep \\nhis eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him \\nfeel sick — something hard knocked his elbow and he \\ntucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning — now \\nit felt as though cold hands were slapping his face — \\nsquinting through his glasses he saw a blurred \\nstream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the \\nrooms beyond — his bacon sandwiches were \\nchurning inside him — he closed his eyes again \\nwishing it would stop, and then — \\n\\nHe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the \\nbridge of his glasses snap. \\n\\nDizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to \\nhis feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He \\nwas quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. \\n\\nPage | 55 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll he could tell was that he was standing in the stone \\nfireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard’s \\nshop — but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a \\nHogwarts school list. \\n\\nA glass case nearby held a withered hand on a \\ncushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring \\nglass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the \\nwalls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the \\ncounter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from \\nthe ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry \\ncould see through the dusty shop window was \\ndefinitely not Diagon Alley. \\n\\nThe sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still \\nstinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his \\nway swiftly and silently toward the door, but before \\nhe’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on \\nthe other side of the glass — and one of them was the \\nvery last person Harry wanted to meet when he was \\nlost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: \\nDraco Malfoy. \\n\\nHarry looked quickly around and spotted a large \\nblack cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled \\nthe doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer \\nthrough. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy \\nstepped into the shop. \\n\\nThe man who followed could only be Draco’s father. \\n\\nHe had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, \\ngray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily \\nat the items on display, and rang a bell on the \\ncounter before turning to his son and saying, “Touch \\nnothing, Draco.” \\n\\nMalfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I \\nthought you were going to buy me a present.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 56 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his \\nfather, drumming his fingers on the counter. \\n\\n“What’s the good of that if I’m not on the House \\nteam?” said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. \\n“Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. \\nSpecial permission from Dumbledore so he could play \\nfor Gryffindor. He’s not even that good, it’s just \\nbecause he’s famous ... famous for having a stupid \\nscar on his forehead. ...” \\n\\nMalfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls. \\n\\n\"... everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful Potter \\nwith his scar and his broomstick — ” \\n\\n“You have told me this at least a dozen times \\nalready,” said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his \\nson. “And I would remind you that it is not — prudent \\n— to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when \\nmost of our kind regard him as the hero who made \\nthe Dark Lord disappear — ah, Mr. Borgin.” \\n\\nA stooping man had appeared behind the counter, \\nsmoothing his greasy hair back from his face. \\n\\n“Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said \\nMr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. “Delighted — \\nand young Master Malfoy, too — charmed. How may I \\nbe of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and \\nvery reasonably priced — ” \\n\\n“I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” said \\nMr. Malfoy. \\n\\n“Selling?” The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin ’s \\nface. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 57 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is \\nconducting more raids,” said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll \\nof parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it \\nfor Mr. Borgin to read. “I have a few — ah — items at \\nhome that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were \\nto call. ...” \\n\\nMr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and \\nlooked down the list. \\n\\n“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, \\nsurely?” \\n\\nMr. Malfoy’s lip curled. \\n\\n“I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still \\ncommands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows \\never more meddlesome. There are rumors about a \\nnew Muggle Protection Act — no doubt that flea- \\nbitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry felt a hot surge of anger. \\n\\n“ — and as you see, certain of these poisons might \\nmake it appear — ” \\n\\n“I understand, sir, of course,” said Mr. Borgin. “Let \\nme see ...” \\n\\n“Can I have that?” interrupted Draco, pointing at the \\nwithered hand on its cushion. \\n\\n“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr. Borgin, abandoning \\nMr. Malfoy’s list and scurrying over to Draco. “Insert a \\ncandle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend \\nof thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, \\nsir.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 58 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a \\nplunderer, Borgin,” said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. \\nBorgin said quickly, “No offense, sir, no offense meant \\n\\n\\n\\n“Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy, \\nmore coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for \\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s not my fault,” retorted Draco. “The teachers all \\nhave favorites, that Hermione Granger — ” \\n\\n“I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of \\nno wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped \\nMr. Malfoy. \\n\\n“Ha!” said Harry under his breath, pleased to see \\nDraco looking both abashed and angry. \\n\\n“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily \\nvoice. “Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere — \\n\\n\\n\\n“Not with me,” said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils \\nflaring. \\n\\n“No, sir, nor with me, sir,” said Mr. Borgin, with a \\ndeep bow. \\n\\n“In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,” said \\nMr. Malfoy shortly. “I am in something of a hurry, \\nBorgin, I have important business elsewhere today — ” \\n\\nThey started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as \\nDraco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, \\nexamining the objects for sale. Draco paused to \\nexamine a long coil of hangman’s rope and to read, \\nsmirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 59 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed — Has \\nClaimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date. \\n\\n\\n\\nDraco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front \\nof him. He walked forward — he stretched out his \\nhand for the handle — \\n\\n“Done,” said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. “Come, Draco \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco \\nturned away. \\n\\n“Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. Ill expect you at the \\nmanor tomorrow to pick up the goods.” \\n\\nThe moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped \\nhis oily manner. \\n\\n“Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories \\nare true, you haven’t sold me half of what’s hidden in \\nyour manor. ...” \\n\\nMuttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back \\nroom. Harry waited for a minute in case he came \\nback, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the \\ncabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop \\ndoor. \\n\\nClutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared \\naround. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that \\nseemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the \\nDark Arts. The one he’d just left, Borgin and Burkes, \\nlooked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty \\nwindow display of shrunken heads and, two doors \\ndown, a large cage was alive with gigantic black \\nspiders. Two shab by-looking wizards were watching \\nhim from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each \\nother. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his \\nPage | 60 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nglasses on straight and hoping against hope he’d be \\nable to find a way out of here. \\n\\nAn old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling \\npoisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn \\nAlley. This didn’t help, as Harry had never heard of \\nsuch a place. He supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly \\nenough through his mouthful of ashes back in the \\nWeasleys’ fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what \\nto do. \\n\\n“Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in his ear, \\nmaking him jump. \\n\\nAn aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of \\nwhat looked horribly like whole human fingernails. \\n\\nShe leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry \\nbacked away. \\n\\n“I’m fine, thanks,” he said. “I’m just — ” \\n\\n“HARRY! What d’yeh think yer doin’ down there?” \\n\\nHarry’s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of \\nfingernails cascaded down over her feet and she \\ncursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts \\ngamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black \\neyes flashing over his great bristling beard. \\n\\n“Hagrid!” Harry croaked in relief. “I was lost — Floo \\npowder — ” \\n\\nHagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and \\npulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray \\nright out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them all \\nthe way along the twisting alleyway out into bright \\nsunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble \\nbuilding in the distance — Gringotts Bank. Hagrid \\nhad steered him right into Diagon Alley. \\n\\nPage | 61 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yer a mess!” said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off \\nHarry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a \\nbarrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary. \\n\\n“Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — dodgy \\nplace, Harry — don’ want no one ter see yeh down \\nthere — ” \\n\\n“I realized that,” said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made \\nto brush him off again. “I told you, I was lost — what \\nwere you doing down there, anyway?” \\n\\n“ I was lookin’ fer a Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent,” \\ngrowled Hagrid. “They’re ruinin’ the school cabbages. \\nYer not on yer own?” \\n\\n“I’m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,” \\nHarry explained. “I’ve got to go and find them. ...” \\n\\nThey set off together down the street. \\n\\n“How come yeh never wrote back ter me?” said Hagrid \\nas Harry jogged alongside him (he had to take three \\nsteps to every stride of Hagrid ’s enormous boots). \\nHarry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys. \\n\\n“Lousy Muggles,” growled Hagrid. “If I’d’ve known — ” \\n\\n“Harry! Harry! Over here!” \\n\\nHarry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing \\nat the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She \\nran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying \\nbehind her. \\n\\n“What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid — Oh, \\nit’s wonderful to see you two again — Are you coming \\ninto Gringotts, Harry?” \\n\\n“As soon as I’ve found the Weasleys,” said Harry. \\n\\nPage | 62 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeh won’t have long ter wait,” Hagrid said with a \\ngrin. \\n\\nHarry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the \\ncrowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and \\nMr. Weasley. \\n\\n“Harry,” Mr. Weasley panted. “We hoped you’d only \\ngone one grate too far. ...” He mopped his glistening \\nbald patch. “Molly’s frantic — she’s coming now — ” \\n\\n“Where did you come out?” Ron asked. \\n\\n“Knockturn Alley,” said Hagrid grimly. \\n\\n“Excellent.” said Fred and George together. \\n\\n“We’ve never been allowed in,” said Ron enviously. \\n\\n“I should ruddy well think not,” growled Hagrid. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her \\nhandbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just \\nclinging onto the other. \\n\\n“Oh, Harry — oh, my dear — you could have been \\nanywhere — ” \\n\\nGasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush \\nout of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid \\nhadn’t managed to beat away. Mr. Weasley took \\nHarry’s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and \\nreturned them, good as new. \\n\\n“Well, gotta be off,” said Hagrid, who was having his \\nhand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (“Knockturn Alley! If you \\nhadn’t found him, Hagrid!”). “See yer at Hogwarts!” \\nAnd he strode away, head and shoulders taller than \\nanyone else in the packed street. \\n\\nPage | 63 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?” Harry \\nasked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the \\nGringotts steps. “Malfoy and his father.” \\n\\n“Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?” said Mr. Weasley \\nsharply behind them. \\n\\n“No, he was selling — ” \\n\\n“So he’s worried,” said Mr. Weasley with grim \\nsatisfaction. “Oh, I’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for \\nsomething. ...” \\n\\n“You be careful, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply \\nas they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the \\ndoor. “That family’s trouble. Don’t go biting off more \\nthan you can chew — ” \\n\\n“So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius Malfoy?” \\nsaid Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted \\nalmost at once by the sight of Hermione’s parents, \\nwho were standing nervously at the counter that ran \\nall along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione \\nto introduce them. \\n\\n“But you’re Mugglesl” said Mr. Weasley delightedly. \\n“We must have a drink! What’s that you’ve got there? \\nOh, you’re changing Muggle money. Molly, look!” He \\npointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr. \\nGranger’s hand. \\n\\n“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the \\nWeasleys and Harry were led off to their underground \\nvaults by another Gringotts goblin. \\n\\nThe vaults were reached by means of small, goblin- \\ndriven carts that sped along minature train tracks \\nthrough the bank’s underground tunnels. Harry \\nenjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys’ \\n\\nPage | 64 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in \\nKnock- turn Alley, when it was opened. There was a \\nvery small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one \\ngold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners \\nbefore sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt \\neven worse when they reached his vault. He tried to \\nblock the contents from view as he hastily shoved \\nhandfuls of coins into a leather bag. \\n\\nBack outside on the marble steps, they all separated. \\nPercy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. \\nFred and George had spotted their friend from \\nHogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were \\ngoing to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was \\ninsisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky \\nCauldron for a drink. \\n\\n“Well all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to \\nbuy your schoolbooks,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting off \\nwith Ginny. “And not one step down Knockturn \\nAlley!” she shouted at the twins’ retreating backs. \\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the \\nwinding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and \\nbronze jangling cheerfully in Harry’s pocket was \\nclamoring to be spent, so he bought three large \\nstrawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they \\nslurped happily as they wandered up the alley, \\nexamining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed \\nlongingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the \\nwindows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until \\nHermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment \\nnext door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke \\nShop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who \\nwere stocking up on Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet- \\nStart, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full \\nof broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old \\ncloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 65 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndeeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book \\ncalled Prefects Who Gained Power. \\n\\n“A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers,” \\nRon read aloud off the back cover. “That sounds \\nfascinating. ...” \\n\\n“Go away,” Percy snapped. \\n\\n“ ’Course, he’s very ambitious, Percy, he’s got it all \\nplanned out. ... He wants to be Minister of Magic ...” \\nRon told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they \\nleft Percy to it. \\n\\nAn hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. \\nThey were by no means the only ones making their \\nway to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw \\nto their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the \\ndoors, trying to get in. The reason for this was \\nproclaimed by a large banner stretched across the \\nupper windows: \\n\\nGILDEROY LOCKHART \\n\\nwill be signing copies of his autobiography \\n\\nMAGICAL ME \\n\\ntoday 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. \\n\\n“We can actually meet him!” Hermione squealed. “I \\nmean, he’s written almost the whole booklist!” \\n\\nThe crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches \\naround Mrs. Weasley’s age. A harassed-looking wizard \\nstood at the door, saying, “Calmly, please, ladies. ... \\nDon’t push, there ... mind the books, now. ...” \\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long \\nline wound right to the back of the shop, where \\nGilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each \\n\\nPage | 66 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngrabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade \\n2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the \\nWeasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger. \\n\\n“Oh, there you are, good,” said Mrs. Weasley. She \\nsounded breathless and kept patting her hair. “Well \\nbe able to see him in a minute. ...” \\n\\nGilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a \\ntable surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all \\nwinking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the \\ncrowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget- \\nme-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his \\npointed wizard’s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his \\nwavy hair. \\n\\nA short, irritable-looking man was dancing around \\ntaking photographs with a large black camera that \\nemitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding \\nflash. \\n\\n“Out of the way, there,” he snarled at Ron, moving \\nback to get a better shot. “This is for the Daily Prophet \\n\\n\\n\\n“Big deal,” said Ron, rubbing his foot where the \\nphotographer had stepped on it. \\n\\nGilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw \\nRon — and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he \\nleapt to his feet and positively shouted, “It can’t be \\nHarry Potter?” \\n\\nThe crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart \\ndived forward, seized Harry’s arm, and pulled him to \\nthe front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry’s face \\nburned as Lockhart shook his hand for the \\nphotographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting \\nthick smoke over the Weasleys. \\n\\nPage | 67 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nice big smile, Harry,” said Lockhart, through his \\nown gleaming teeth. “Together, you and I are worth \\nthe front page.” \\n\\nWhen he finally let go of Harry’s hand, Harry could \\nhardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to \\nthe Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his \\nshoulders and clamped him tightly to his side. \\n\\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said loudly, waving for \\nquiet. “What an extraordinary moment this is! The \\nperfect moment for me to make a little announcement \\nI’ve been sitting on for some time! \\n\\n“When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and \\nBlotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography \\n— which I shall be happy to present him now, free of \\ncharge — ” The crowd applauded again. “He had no \\nidea,” Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake \\nthat made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, “that \\nhe would shortly be getting much, much more than \\nmy book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in \\nfact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and \\ngentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in \\nannouncing that this September, I will be taking up \\nthe post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at \\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!” \\n\\nThe crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found \\nhimself being presented with the entire works of \\nGilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their \\nweight, he managed to make his way out of the \\nlimelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was \\nstanding next to her new cauldron. \\n\\n“You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the \\nbooks into the cauldron. “I’ll buy my own — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 68 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said a voice \\nHarry had no trouble recognizing. He straightened up \\nand found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, \\nwho was wearing his usual sneer. \\n\\n“Famous Harry Potter,” said Malfoy. “Can’t even go \\ninto a bookshop without making the front page.” \\n\\n“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny. \\nIt was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry. \\nShe was glaring at Malfoy. \\n\\n“Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend).” drawled \\nMalfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione \\nfought their way over, both clutching stacks of \\nLockhart’s books. \\n\\n“Oh, it’s you,” said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he \\nwere something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. \\n“Bet you’re surprised to see Harry here, eh?” \\n\\n“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, \\nWeasley,” retorted Malfoy. “I suppose your parents \\nwill go hungry for a month to pay for all those.” \\n\\nRon went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into \\nthe cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but \\nHarry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket. \\n\\n“Ron!” said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred \\nand George. “What are you doing? It’s too crowded in \\nhere, let’s go outside.” \\n\\n“Well, well, well — Arthur Weasley.” \\n\\nIt was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco’s \\nshoulder, sneering in just the same way. \\n\\n“Lucius,” said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly. \\n\\nPage | 69 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy. \\n“All those raids ... I hope they’re paying you \\novertime?” \\n\\nHe reached into Ginny’s cauldron and extracted, from \\namid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very \\nbattered copy of A Beginner’s Guide to Transfiguration. \\n\\n“Obviously not,” Mr. Malfoy said. “Dear me, what’s \\nthe use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if \\nthey don’t even pay you well for it?” \\n\\nMr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny. \\n\\n“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the \\nname of wizard, Malfoy,” he said. \\n\\n“Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to \\nMr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching \\napprehensively. “The company you keep, Weasley ... \\nand I thought your family could sink no lower — ” \\n\\nThere was a thud of metal as Ginny’s cauldron went \\nflying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, \\nknocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of \\nheavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their \\nheads; there was a yell of, “Get him, Dad!” from Fred \\nor George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, “No, Arthur, \\nno!”; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more \\nshelves over; “Gentlemen, please — please!” cried the \\nassistant, and then, louder than all — \\n\\n“Break it up, there, gents, break it up — ” \\n\\nHagrid was wading toward them through the sea of \\nbooks. In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and \\nMr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. \\nMalfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of \\nToadstools. He was still holding Ginny’s old \\nPage | 70 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTransfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes \\nglittering with malice. \\n\\n“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your \\nfather can give you — ” Pulling himself out of Hagrid’s \\ngrip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop. \\n\\n“Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid, \\nalmost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he \\nstraightened his robes. “Rotten ter the core, the whole \\nfamily, everyone knows that — no Malfoy’s worth \\nlistenin’ ter — bad blood, that’s what it is — come on \\nnow — let’s get outta here.” \\n\\nThe assistant looked as though he wanted to stop \\nthem from leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid’s \\nwaist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried \\nup the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and \\nMrs. Weasley beside herself with fury. \\n\\n“A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in \\npublic ... what Gilderoy Lockhart must’ve thought — ” \\n\\n“He was pleased,” said Fred. “Didn’t you hear him as \\nwe were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the \\nDaily Prophet if he’d be able to work the fight into his \\nreport — said it was all publicity — ” \\n\\nBut it was a subdued group that headed back to the \\nfireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the \\nWeasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling \\nback to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said \\ngood-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub \\nfor the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley \\nstarted to ask them how bus stops worked, but \\nstopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley’s face. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 71 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry took off his glasses and put them safely in his \\npocket before helping himself to Floo powder. It \\ndefinitely wasn’t his favorite way to travel. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 72 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WHOMPING WILLOW \\n\\nThe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for \\nHarry’s liking. He was looking forward to getting back \\nto Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been \\nthe happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel \\njealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and \\nthe sort of welcome he could expect next time he \\nturned up on Privet Drive. \\n\\nOn their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a \\nsumptuous dinner that included all of Harry’s favorite \\nthings, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. \\nFred and George rounded off the evening with a \\ndisplay of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen \\nwith red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to \\nwall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a \\nlast mug of hot chocolate and bed. \\n\\nIt took a long while to get started next morning. They \\nwere up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to \\nhave a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley dashed about in \\na bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people \\nkept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of \\nPage | 73 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\ntoast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke \\nhis neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed \\nthe yard carrying Ginny’s trunk to the car. \\n\\nHarry couldn’t see how eight people, six large trunks, \\ntwo owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small \\nFord Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the \\nspecial features that Mr. Weasley had added. \\n\\n“Not a word to Molly,” he whispered to Harry as he \\nopened the trunk and showed him how it had been \\nmagically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily. \\n\\nWhen at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley \\nglanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, \\nGeorge, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by \\nside, and said, “Muggles do know more than we give \\nthem credit for, don’t they?” She and Ginny got into \\nthe front seat, which had been stretched so that it \\nresembled a park bench. “I mean, you’d never know it \\nwas this roomy from the outside, would you?” \\n\\nMr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled \\nout of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at \\nthe house. He barely had time to wonder when he’d \\nsee it again when they were back — George had \\nforgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes \\nafter that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that \\nFred could run in for his broomstick. They had \\nalmost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked \\nthat she’d left her diary. By the time she had \\nclambered back into the car, they were running very \\nlate, and tempers were running high. \\n\\nMr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his \\nwife. \\n\\n“Molly, dear — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 74 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, Arthur — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“No one would see — this little button here is an \\nInvisibility Booster I installed — that’d get us up in \\nthe air — then we fly above the clouds. We’d be there \\nin ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser — ” \\n\\n“I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight — ” \\n\\nThey reached King’s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. \\nWeasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for \\ntheir trunks and they all hurried into the station. \\n\\nHarry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous \\nyear. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine \\nand three-quarters, which wasn’t visible to the \\nMuggle eye. What you had to do was walk through \\nthe solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It \\ndidn’t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that \\nnone of the Muggles noticed you vanishing. \\n\\n“Percy first,” said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at \\nthe clock overhead, which showed they had only five \\nminutes to disappear casually through the barrier. \\n\\nPercy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. \\nWeasley went next; Fred and George followed. \\n\\n“I’ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,” Mrs. \\nWeasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny’s hand \\nand setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone. \\n\\n“Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute,” Ron said \\nto Harry. \\n\\nHarry made sure that Hedwig’s cage was safely \\nwedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley \\naround to face the barrier. He felt perfectly confident; \\nthis wasn’t nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo \\n\\nPage | 75 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npowder. Both of them bent low over the handles of \\ntheir trolleys and walked purposefully toward the \\nbarrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they \\nbroke into a run and — \\n\\nCRASH. \\n\\nBoth trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; \\nRon’s trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was \\nknocked off his feet, and Hedwig’s cage bounced onto \\nthe shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking \\nindignantly; people all around them stared and a \\nguard nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think \\nyou’re doing?” \\n\\n“Lost control of the trolley,” Harry gasped, clutching \\nhis ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who \\nwas causing such a scene that there was a lot of \\nmuttering about cruelty to animals from the \\nsurrounding crowd. \\n\\n“Why can’t we get through?” Harry hissed to Ron. \\n\\n“I dunno — ” \\n\\nRon looked wildly around. A dozen curious people \\nwere still watching them. \\n\\n“We’re going to miss the train,” Ron whispered. “I \\ndon’t understand why the gateway’s sealed itself — ” \\n\\nHarry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening \\nfeeling in the pit of his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine \\nseconds ... \\n\\nHe wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was \\nright against the barrier and pushed with all his \\nmight. The metal remained solid. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 76 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThree seconds ... two seconds ... one second ... \\n\\n“It’s gone,” said Ron, sounding stunned. “The train’s \\nleft. What if Mum and Dad can’t get back through to \\nus? Have you got any Muggle money?” \\n\\nHarry gave a hollow laugh. “The Dursleys haven’t \\ngiven me pocket money for about six years.” \\n\\nRon pressed his ear to the cold barrier. \\n\\n“Can’t hear a thing,” he said tensely. “What’re we \\ngoing to do? I don’t know how long it’ll take Mum and \\nDad to get back to us.” \\n\\nThey looked around. People were still watching them, \\nmainly because of Hedwig’s continuing screeches. \\n\\n“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said \\nHarry. “We’re attracting too much atten — ” \\n\\n“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!” \\n\\n“What about it?” \\n\\n“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!” \\n\\n“But I thought — ” \\n\\n“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, \\nhaven’t we? And even underage wizards are allowed to \\nuse magic if it’s a real emergency, section nineteen or \\nsomething of the Restriction of Thingy — ” \\n\\n“But your mum and dad ...” said Harry, pushing \\nagainst the barrier again in the vain hope that it \\nwould give way. “How will they get home?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 77 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They \\nknow how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and \\nreappear at home! They only bother with Floo powder \\nand the car because we’re all underage and we’re not \\nallowed to Apparate yet. ...” \\n\\nHarry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to \\nexcitement. \\n\\n“Can you fly it?” \\n\\n“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to \\nface the exit. “C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able \\nto follow the Hogwarts Express — ” \\n\\nAnd they marched off through the crowd of curious \\nMuggles, out of the station and back onto the side \\nroad where the old Ford Anglia was parked. \\n\\nRon unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of \\ntaps from his wand. They heaved their luggage back \\nin, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the \\nfront. \\n\\n“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the \\nignition with another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his \\nhead out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along \\nthe main road ahead, but their street was empty. \\n\\n“Okay,” he said. \\n\\nRon pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. \\nThe car around them vanished — and so did they. \\nHarry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear \\nthe engine, feel his hands on his knees and his \\nglasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had \\nbecome a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the \\nground in a dingy street full of parked cars. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 78 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let’s go,” said Ron’s voice from his right. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the ground and the dirty buildings on either side \\nfell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in \\nseconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and \\nglittering, below them. \\n\\nThen there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, \\nand Ron reappeared. \\n\\n“Uh-oh,” said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \\n“It’s faulty — ” \\n\\nBoth of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it \\nflickered back again. \\n\\n“Hold on!” Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the \\naccelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly \\nclouds and everything turned dull and foggy. \\n\\n“Now what?” said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of \\ncloud pressing in on them from all sides. \\n\\n“We need to see the train to know what direction to go \\nin,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Dip back down again — quickly — ” \\n\\nThey dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted \\naround in their seats, squinting at the ground. \\n\\n“I can see it!” Harry yelled. “Right ahead — there!” \\n\\nThe Hogwarts Express was streaking along below \\nthem like a scarlet snake. \\n\\n“Due north,” said Ron, checking the compass on the \\ndashboard. “Okay, we’ll just have to check on it every \\nhalf hour or so — hold on — ” \\n\\nPage | 79 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, \\nthey burst out into a blaze of sunlight. \\n\\nIt was a different world. The wheels of the car \\nskimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, \\nendless blue under the blinding white sun. \\n\\n“All we’ve got to worry about now are airplanes,” said \\nRon. \\n\\nThey looked at each other and started to laugh; for a \\nlong time, they couldn’t stop. \\n\\nIt was as though they had been plunged into a \\nfabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely the \\nonly way to travel — past swirls and turrets of snowy \\ncloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat \\npack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the \\nprospect of seeing Fred’s and George’s jealous faces \\nwhen they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the \\nsweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle. \\n\\nThey made regular checks on the train as they flew \\nfarther and farther north, each dip beneath the \\nclouds showing them a different view. London was \\nsoon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields \\nthat gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great \\ncity alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages \\nwith tiny toy churches. \\n\\nSeveral uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to \\nadmit that some of the fun was wearing off. The \\ntoffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had \\nnothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their \\nsweaters, but Harry’s T-shirt was sticking to the back \\nof his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the \\nend of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the \\nfantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking \\nlongingly of the train miles below, where you could \\nPage | 80 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbuy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a \\nplump witch. Why hadn’t they been able to get onto \\nplatform nine and three-quarters? \\n\\n“Can’t be much further, can it?” croaked Ron, hours \\nlater still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of \\ncloud, staining it a deep pink. “Ready for another \\ncheck on the train?” \\n\\nIt was still right below them, winding its way past a \\nsnowcapped mountain. It was much darker beneath \\nthe canopy of clouds. \\n\\nRon put his foot on the accelerator and drove them \\nupward again, but as he did so, the engine began to \\nwhine. \\n\\nHarry and Ron exchanged nervous glances. \\n\\n“It’s probably just tired,” said Ron. “It’s never been \\nthis far before. ...” \\n\\nAnd they both pretended not to notice the whining \\ngrowing louder and louder as the sky became steadily \\ndarker. Stars were blossoming in the blackness. \\n\\nHarry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the \\nway the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as \\nthough in protest. \\n\\n“Not far,” said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, \\n\\n“not far now,” and he patted the dashboard \\nnervously. \\n\\nWhen they flew back beneath the clouds a little while \\nlater, they had to squint through the darkness for a \\nlandmark they knew. \\n\\n“There!” Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig \\njump. “Straight ahead!” \\n\\nPage | 81 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSilhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over \\nthe lake, stood the many turrets and towers of \\nHogwarts castle. \\n\\nBut the car had begun to shudder and was losing \\nspeed. \\n\\n“Come on,” Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering \\nwheel a little shake, “nearly there, come on — ” \\n\\nThe engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were \\nissuing from under the hood. Harry found himself \\ngripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew \\ntoward the lake. \\n\\nThe car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his \\nwindow, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface \\nof the water, a mile below. Ron’s knuckles were white \\non the steering wheel. The car wobbled again. \\n\\n“Come on,” Ron muttered. \\n\\nThey were over the lake — the castle was right ahead \\n— Ron put his foot down. \\n\\nThere was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine \\ndied completely. \\n\\n“Uh-oh,” said Ron, into the silence. \\n\\nThe nose of the car dropped. They were falling, \\ngathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle \\nwall. \\n\\n“IVoooooo!” Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel \\naround; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as \\nthe car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark \\ngreenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out \\nover the black lawns, losing altitude all the time. \\n\\nPage | 82 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled \\nhis wand out of his back pocket — \\n\\n\\n\\n“STOP! STOP!” he yelled, whacking the dashboard \\nand the windshield, but they were still plummeting, \\nthe ground flying up toward them — \\n\\n“WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!” Harry bellowed, \\nlunging for the steering wheel, but too late — \\n\\nCRUNCH. \\n\\nWith an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit \\nthe thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a \\nheavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the \\ncrumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a \\ngolf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on Harry’s head \\nwhere he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron \\nlet out a low, despairing groan. \\n\\n“Are you okay?” Harry said urgently. \\n\\n“My wand,” said Ron, in a shaky voice. “Look at my \\nwand — ” \\n\\nIt had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling \\nlimply, held on by a few splinters. \\n\\nHarry opened his mouth to say he was sure they’d be \\nable to mend it up at the school, but he never even \\ngot started. At that very moment, something hit his \\nside of the car with the force of a charging bull, \\nsending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an \\nequally heavy blow hit the roof. \\n\\n“What’s happen — ?” \\n\\nRon gasped, staring through the windshield, and \\nHarry looked around just in time to see a branch as \\n\\nPage | 83 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthick as a python smash into it. The tree they had hit \\nwas attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost \\ndouble, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every \\ninch of the car it could reach. \\n\\n“Aaargh!” said Ron as another twisted limb punched a \\nlarge dent into his door; the windshield was now \\ntrembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like \\ntwigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was \\npounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be \\ncaving — \\n\\n“Run for it!” Ron shouted, throwing his full weight \\nagainst his door, but next second he had been \\nknocked backward into Harry’s lap by a vicious \\nuppercut from another branch. \\n\\n“We’re done for!” he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but \\nsuddenly the floor of the car was vibrating — the \\nengine had restarted. \\n\\n“Reverse!” Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; \\nthe tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear \\nits roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing \\nout at them as they sped out of reach. \\n\\n“That,” panted Ron, “was close. Well done, car — ” \\n\\nThe car, however, had reached the end of its tether. \\nWith two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry \\nfelt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was \\nsprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told him \\nthat the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; \\nHedwig’s cage flew through the air and burst open; \\nshe rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off \\ntoward the castle without a backward look. Then, \\ndented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off \\ninto the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 84 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come back!” Ron yelled after it, brandishing his \\nbroken wand. “Dad’ll kill me!” \\n\\nBut the car disappeared from view with one last snort \\nfrom its exhaust. \\n\\n“Can you believe our luck?” said Ron miserably, \\nbending down to pick up Scabbers. “Of all the trees \\nwe could’ve hit, we had to get one that hits back.” \\n\\nHe glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, \\nwhich was still flailing its branches threateningly. \\n\\n“Come on,” said Harry wearily, “we’d better get up to \\nthe school. ...” \\n\\nIt wasn’t at all the triumphant arrival they had \\npictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends \\nof their trunks and began dragging them up the \\ngrassy slope, toward the great oak front doors. \\n\\n“I think the feast’s already started,” said Ron, \\ndropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and \\ncrossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window. \\n“Hey — Harry — come and look — it’s the Sorting!” \\n\\nHarry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered \\nin at the Great Hall. \\n\\nInnumerable candles were hovering in midair over \\nfour long, crowded tables, making the golden plates \\nand goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, \\nwhich always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with \\nstars. \\n\\nThrough the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, \\nHarry saw a long line of scared-looking first years \\nfiling into the Hall. Ginny was among them, easily \\nvisible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile, \\n\\nPage | 85 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her \\nhair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts \\nSorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers. \\n\\nEvery year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and \\ndirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts \\nhouses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and \\nSlytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, \\nexactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its \\ndecision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few \\nhorrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going \\nto put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned \\nout more Dark witches and wizards than any other — \\nbut he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, \\nHermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, \\nHarry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House \\nChampionship, beating Slytherin for the first time in \\nseven years. \\n\\nA very small, mousy-haired boy had been called \\nforward to place the hat on his head. Harry’s eyes \\nwandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, \\nthe headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the \\nstaff table, his long silver beard and half-moon \\nglasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several \\nseats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in \\nrobes of aquamarine. And there at the end was \\nHagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his \\ngoblet. \\n\\n“Hang on ...” Harry muttered to Ron. “There’s an \\nempty chair at the staff table. ... Where’s Snape?” \\n\\nProfessor Severus Snape was Harry’s least favorite \\nteacher. Harry also happened to be Snape ’s least \\nfavorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by \\neverybody except the students from his own House \\n(Slytherin), Snape taught Potions. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 86 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Maybe he’s ill!” said Ron hopefully. \\n\\n“Maybe he’s left,” said Harry, “because he missed out \\non the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again).” \\n\\n“Or he might have been sacked).” said Ron \\nenthusiastically. “I mean, everyone hates him — ” \\n\\n“Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them, \\n“he’s waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the \\nschool train.” \\n\\nHarry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in \\na cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin \\nman with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, \\nshoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he \\nwas smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were \\nin very deep trouble. \\n\\n“Follow me,” said Snape. \\n\\nNot daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron \\nfollowed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing \\nentrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A \\ndelicious smell of food was wafting from the Great \\nHall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and \\nlight, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the \\ndungeons. \\n\\n“In!” he said, opening a door halfway down the cold \\npassageway and pointing. \\n\\nThey entered Snape’s office, shivering. The shadowy \\nwalls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in \\nwhich floated all manner of revolting things Harry \\ndidn’t really want to know the name of at the \\nmoment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape \\nclosed the door and turned to look at them. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 87 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“So,” he said softly, “the train isn’t good enough for \\nthe famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick, \\nWeasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?” \\n\\n“No, sir, it was the barrier at King’s Cross, it — ” \\n\\n“Silence!” said Snape coldly. “What have you done \\nwith the car?” \\n\\nRon gulped. This wasn’t the first time Snape had \\ngiven Harry the impression of being able to read \\nminds. But a moment later, he understood, as Snape \\nunrolled today’s issue of the Evening Prophet \\n\\n“You were seen,” he hissed, showing them the \\nheadline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES \\nMUGGLES. He began to read aloud: “Two Muggles in \\nLondon, convinced they saw an old car flying over the \\nPost Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty \\nBayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus \\nFleet, of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven \\nMuggles in all. I believe your father works in the \\nMisuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?” he said, looking \\nup at Ron and smiling still more nastily. “Dear, dear \\n... his own son ...” \\n\\nHarry felt as though he’d just been walloped in the \\nstomach by one of the mad tree’s larger branches. If \\nanyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car \\n...he hadn’t thought of that. ... \\n\\n“I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable \\ndamage seems to have been done to a very valuable \\nWhomping Willow,” Snape went on. \\n\\n“That tree did more damage to us than we — ” Ron \\nblurted out. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 88 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Silence!” snapped Snape again. “Most unfortunately, \\nyou are not in my House and the decision to expel \\nyou does not rest with me. I shall go and fetch the \\npeople who do have that happy power. You will wait \\nhere.” \\n\\nHarry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. \\nHarry didn’t feel hungry anymore. He now felt \\nextremely sick. He tried not to look at a large, slimy \\nsomething suspended in green liquid on a shelf \\nbehind Snape ’s desk. If Snape had gone to fetch \\nProfessor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they \\nwere hardly any better off. She might be fairer than \\nSnape, but she was still extremely strict. \\n\\nTen minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough \\nit was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him. \\nHarry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on \\nseveral occasions, but either he had forgotten just \\nhow thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen \\nher this angry before. She raised her wand the \\nmoment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, \\nbut she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, \\nwhere flames suddenly erupted. \\n\\n“Sit,” she said, and they both backed into chairs by \\nthe fire. \\n\\n“Explain,” she said, her glasses glinting ominously. \\n\\nRon launched into the story, starting with the barrier \\nat the station refusing to let them through. \\n\\n“ — so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn’t get on \\nthe train.” \\n\\n“Why didn’t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you \\nhave an owl?” Professor McGonagall said coldly to \\nHarry. \\n\\nPage | 89 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry gaped at her. Now she’d said it, that seemed \\nthe obvious thing to have done. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I — I didn’t think — ” \\n\\n“That,” said Professor McGonagall, “is obvious.” \\n\\nThere was a knock on the office door and Snape, now \\nlooking happier than ever, opened it. There stood the \\nheadmaster, Professor Dumbledore. \\n\\nHarry’s whole body went numb. Dumbledore was \\nlooking unusually grave. He stared down his very \\ncrooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found \\nhimself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up \\nby the Whomping Willow. \\n\\nThere was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, \\n“Please explain why you did this.” \\n\\nIt would have been better if he had shouted. Harry \\nhated the disappointment in his voice. For some \\nreason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the \\neyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told \\nDumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley \\nowned the bewitched car, making it sound as though \\nhe and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked \\noutside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see \\nthrough this at once, but Dumbledore asked no \\nquestions about the car. When Harry had finished, he \\nmerely continued to peer at them through his \\nspectacles. \\n\\n“Well go and get our stuff,” said Ron in a hopeless \\nsort of voice. \\n\\n“What are you talking about, Weasley?” barked \\nProfessor McGonagall. \\n\\nPage | 90 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, you’re expelling us, aren’t you?” said Ron. \\n\\nHarry looked quickly at Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Not today, Mr. Weasley,” said Dumbledore. “But I \\nmust impress upon both of you the seriousness of \\nwhat you have done. I will be writing to both your \\nfamilies tonight. I must also warn you that if you do \\nanything like this again, I will have no choice but to \\nexpel you.” \\n\\nSnape looked as though Christmas had been \\ncanceled. He cleared his throat and said, “Professor \\nDumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for \\nthe Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious \\ndamage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of \\nthis nature — ” \\n\\n“It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these \\nboys’ punishments, Severus,” said Dumbledore \\ncalmly. “They are in her House and are therefore her \\nresponsibility.” He turned to Professor McGonagall. “I \\nmust go back to the feast, Minerva, I’ve got to give out \\na few notices. Come, Severus, there’s a delicious- \\nlooking custard tart I want to sample — ” \\n\\nSnape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as \\nhe allowed himself to be swept out of his office, \\nleaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who \\nwas still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle. \\n\\n“You’d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, \\nyou’re bleeding.” \\n\\n“Not much,” said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his \\neye with his sleeve. “Professor, I wanted to watch my \\nsister being Sorted — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 91 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Sorting Ceremony is over,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall. “Your sister is also in Gryffindor.” \\n\\n“Oh, good,” said Ron. \\n\\n“And speaking of Gryffindor — ” Professor McGonagall \\nsaid sharply, but Harry cut in: “Professor, when we \\ntook the car, term hadn’t started, so — so Gryffindor \\nshouldn’t really have points taken from it — should \\nit?” he finished, watching her anxiously. \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but \\nhe was sure she had almost smiled. Her mouth \\nlooked less thin, anyway. \\n\\n“I will not take any points from Gryffindor,” she said, \\nand Harry’s heart lightened considerably. “But you \\nwill both get a detention.” \\n\\nIt was better than Harry had expected. As for \\nDumbledore’s writing to the Dursleys, that was \\nnothing. Harry knew perfectly well they’d just be \\ndisappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn’t \\nsquashed him flat. \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall raised her wand again and \\npointed it at Snape’s desk. A large plate of \\nsandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced \\npumpkin juice appeared with a pop. \\n\\n“You will eat in here and then go straight up to your \\ndormitory,” she said. “I must also return to the feast.” \\n\\nWhen the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a \\nlong, low whistle. \\n\\n“I thought we’d had it,” he said, grabbing a sandwich. \\n\\n“So did I,” said Harry, taking one, too. \\n\\nPage | 92 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can you believe our luck, though?” said Ron thickly \\nthrough a mouthful of chicken and ham. “Fred and \\nGeorge must’ve flown that car five or six times and no \\nMuggle ever saw them.” He swallowed and took \\nanother huge bite. “Why couldn’t we get through the \\nbarrier?” \\n\\nHarry shrugged. “We’ll have to watch our step from \\nnow on, though,” he said, taking a grateful swig of \\npumpkin juice. “Wish we could’ve gone up to the \\nfeast. ...” \\n\\n“She didn’t want us showing off,” said Ron sagely. \\n“Doesn’t want people to think it’s clever, arriving by \\nflying car.” \\n\\nWhen they had eaten as many sandwiches as they \\ncould (the plate kept refilling itself), they rose and left \\nthe office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor \\nTower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast \\nwas over. They walked past muttering portraits and \\ncreaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of \\nstone stairs, until at last they reached the passage \\nwhere the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was \\nhidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in \\na pink silk dress. \\n\\n“Password?” she said as they approached. \\n\\n“Er — ” said Harry. \\n\\nThey didn’t know the new year’s password, not having \\nmet a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost \\nimmediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them \\nand turned to see Hermione dashing toward them. \\n\\n“There you are! Where have you been? The most \\nridiculous rumors — someone said you’d been \\nexpelled for crashing a flying car — ” \\n\\nPage | 93 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, we haven’t been expelled,” Harry assured her. \\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re not telling me you did fly here?” said \\nHermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor \\nMcGonagall. \\n\\n“Skip the lecture,” said Ron impatiently, “and tell us \\nthe new password.” \\n\\n“It’s ‘wattlebird,’ ” said Hermione impatiently, “but \\nthat’s not the point — ” \\n\\nHer words were cut short, however, as the portrait of \\nthe fat lady swung open and there was a sudden \\nstorm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of \\nGryffindor House was still awake, packed into the \\ncircular common room, standing on the lopsided \\ntables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to \\narrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull \\nHarry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble \\nin after them. \\n\\n“Brilliant!” yelled Lee Jordan. “Inspired! What an \\nentrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping \\nWillow, people’ll be talking about that one for years — \\n\\n\\n\\n“Good for you,” said a fifth year Harry had never \\nspoken to; someone was patting him on the back as \\nthough he’d just won a marathon; Fred and George \\npushed their way to the front of the crowd and said \\ntogether, “Why couldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?” \\nRon was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, \\nbut Harry could see one person who didn’t look happy \\nat all. Percy was visible over the heads of some \\nexcited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get \\nnear enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged \\nRon in the ribs and nodded in Percy’s direction. Ron \\ngot the point at once. \\n\\nPage | 94 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Got to get upstairs — bit tired,” he said, and the two \\nof them started pushing their way toward the door on \\nthe other side of the room, which led to a spiral \\nstaircase and the dormitories. \\n\\n“ ’Night,” Harry called back to Hermione, who was \\nwearing a scowl just like Percy’s. \\n\\nThey managed to get to the other side of the common \\nroom, still having their backs slapped, and gained the \\npeace of the staircase. They hurried up it, right to the \\ntop, and at last reached the door of their old \\ndormitory, which now had a sign on it saying \\nSECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular \\nroom, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet \\nand its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been \\nbrought up for them and stood at the ends of their \\nbeds. \\n\\nRon grinned guiltily at Harry. \\n\\n“I know I shouldn’t ’ve enjoyed that or anything, but — \\n\\n\\n\\nThe dormitory door flew open and in came the other \\nsecond year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean \\nThomas, and Neville Longbottom. \\n\\n“Unbelievablel” beamed Seamus. \\n\\n“Cool,” said Dean. \\n\\n“Amazing,” said Neville, awestruck. \\n\\nHarry couldn’t help it. He grinned, too. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 95 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGILDEROY LOCKHART \\n\\nThe next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. \\nThings started to go downhill from breakfast in the \\nGreat Hall. The four long House tables were laden \\nwith tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains \\nof toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the \\nenchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry \\nand Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to \\nHermione, who had her copy of Voyages with \\nVampires propped open against a milk jug. There was \\na slight stiffness in the way she said “ ’Morning,” \\nwhich told Harry that she was still disapproving of the \\nway they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the \\nother hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a \\nround-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst \\nmemory of anyone Harry had ever met. \\n\\n“Mail’s due any minute — I think Gran’s sending a \\nfew things I forgot.” \\n\\nHarry had only just started his porridge when, sure \\nenough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a \\nhundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and \\n\\nPage | 96 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\ndropping letters and packages into the chattering \\ncrowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville’s \\nhead and, a second later, something large and gray \\nfell into Hermione’s jug, spraying them all with milk \\nand feathers. \\n\\n“Errol\\\\” said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by \\nthe feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, \\nhis legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his \\nbeak. \\n\\n“Oh, no — ” Ron gasped. \\n\\n“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said Hermione, prodding \\nErrol gently with the tip of her finger. \\n\\n“It’s not that — it’s that.” \\n\\nRon was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite \\nordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both \\nlooking at it as though they expected it to explode. \\n\\n“What’s the matter?” said Harry. \\n\\n“She’s — she’s sent me a Howler,” said Ron faintly. \\n\\n“You’d better open it, Ron,” said Neville in a timid \\nwhisper. “It’ll be worse if you don’t. My gran sent me \\none once, and I ignored it and” — he gulped — “it was \\nhorrible.” \\n\\nHarry looked from their petrified faces to the red \\nenvelope. \\n\\n“What’s a Howler?” he said. \\n\\nBut Ron’s whole attention was fixed on the letter, \\nwhich had begun to smoke at the corners. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 97 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Open it,” Neville urged. “It’ll all be over in a few \\nminutes — ” \\n\\nRon stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope \\nfrom Errol’s beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his \\nfingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew \\nwhy. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar \\nof sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the \\nceiling. \\n\\n“— STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN \\nSURPRISED IF THEY’D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT \\nTILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON’T SUPPOSE YOU \\nSTOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I \\nWENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE — ” \\n\\nMrs. Weasley’s yells, a hundred times louder than \\nusual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, \\nand echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People \\nthroughout the hall were swiveling around to see who \\nhad received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his \\nchair that only his crimson forehead could be seen. \\n\\n“— LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I \\nTHOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, \\n\\nWE DIDN’T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, \\nYOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED — ” \\n\\nHarry had been wondering when his name was going \\nto crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he \\ncouldn’t hear the voice that was making his eardrums \\nthrob. \\n\\n“— ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER’S \\nFACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR \\nFAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE \\nWE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 98 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had \\ndropped from Ron’s hand, burst into flames and \\ncurled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as \\nthough a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few \\npeople laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke \\nout again. \\n\\nHermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked \\ndown at the top of Ron’s head. \\n\\n“Well, I don’t know what you expected, Ron, but you \\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t tell me I deserved it,” snapped Ron. \\n\\nHarry pushed his porridge away. His insides were \\nburning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry \\nat work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for \\nhim over the summer . . . \\n\\nBut he had no time to dwell on this; Professor \\nMcGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, \\nhanding out course schedules. Harry took his and \\nsaw that they had double Herbology with the \\nHufflepuffs first. \\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, \\ncrossed the vegetable patch, and made for the \\ngreenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At \\nleast the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione \\nseemed to think they had now been punished enough \\nand was being perfectly friendly again. \\n\\nAs they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of \\nthe class standing outside, waiting for Professor \\nSprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just \\njoined them when she came striding into view across \\nthe lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. \\n\\nProfessor Sprout’s arms were full of bandages, and \\nPage | 99 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the \\nWhomping Willow in the distance, several of its \\nbranches now in slings. \\n\\nProfessor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a \\npatched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually \\na large amount of earth on her clothes and her \\nfingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. \\nGilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in \\nsweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining \\nunder a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold \\ntrimming. \\n\\n“Oh, hello there!” he called, beaming around at the \\n\\nassembled students. “Just been showing Professor \\n\\nSprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! \\n\\nBut I don’t want you running away with the idea that \\n\\nI’m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to \\n\\nhave met several of these exotic plants on my travels \\n?? \\n\\n\\n\\n“Greenhouse three today, chaps!” said Professor \\nSprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at \\nall her usual cheerful self. \\n\\nThere was a murmur of interest. They had only ever \\nworked in greenhouse one before — greenhouse three \\nhoused far more interesting and dangerous plants. \\nProfessor Sprout took a large key from her belt and \\nunlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp \\nearth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume \\nof some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from \\nthe ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione \\ninside when Lockhart’s hand shot out. \\n\\n“Harry! I’ve been wanting a word — you don’t mind if \\nhe’s a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor \\nSprout?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 100 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJudging by Professor Sprout’s scowl, she did mind, \\nbut Lockhart said, “That’s the ticket,” and closed the \\ngreenhouse door in her face. \\n\\n“Harry,” said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming \\nin the sunlight as he shook his head. “Harry, Harry, \\nHarry.” \\n\\nCompletely nonplussed, Harry said nothing. \\n\\n“When I heard — well, of course, it was all my fault. \\nCould have kicked myself.” \\n\\nHarry had no idea what he was talking about. He was \\nabout to say so when Lockhart went on, “Don’t know \\nwhen I’ve been more shocked. Flying a car to \\nHogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you’d \\ndone it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.” \\n\\nIt was remarkable how he could show every one of \\nthose brilliant teeth even when he wasn’t talking. \\n\\n“Gave you a taste for publicity, didn’t I?” said \\nLockhart. “Gave you the bug. You got onto the front \\npage of the paper with me and you couldn’t wait to do \\nit again.” \\n\\n“Oh, no, Professor, see — ” \\n\\n“Harry, Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, reaching out \\nand grasping his shoulder. “I understand. Natural to \\nwant a bit more once you’ve had that first taste — \\nand I blame myself for giving you that, because it was \\nbound to go to your head — but see here, young man, \\nyou can’t start flying cars to try and get yourself \\nnoticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for \\nall that when you’re older. Yes, yes, I know what \\nyou’re thinking! ‘It’s all right for him, he’s an \\ninternationally famous wizard already! ’ But when I \\nPage | 101 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are \\nnow. In fact, I’d say I was even more of a nobody! I \\nmean, a few people have heard of you, haven’t they? \\nAll that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” \\nHe glanced at the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead. \\n\\n“I know, I know — it’s not quite as good as winning \\nWitch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award five \\ntimes in a row, as I have — but it’s a start, Harry, it’s \\na start” \\n\\nHe gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry \\nstood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering \\nhe was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened \\nthe door and slid inside. \\n\\nProfessor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench \\nin the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of \\ndifferent-colored ear-muffs were lying on the bench. \\nWhen Harry had taken his place between Ron and \\nHermione, she said, “We’ll be repotting Mandrakes \\ntoday. Now, who can tell me the properties of the \\nMandrake?” \\n\\nTo nobody’s surprise, Hermione’s hand was first into \\nthe air. \\n\\n“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” \\nsaid Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had \\nswallowed the textbook. “It is used to return people \\nwho have been transfigured or cursed to their original \\nstate.” \\n\\n“Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,” said Professor \\nSprout. “The Mandrake forms an essential part of \\nmost antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who \\ncan tell me why?” \\n\\nHermione’s hand narrowly missed Harry’s glasses as \\nit shot up again. \\n\\nPage | 102 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears \\nit,” she said promptly. \\n\\n“Precisely. Take another ten points,” said Professor \\nSprout. “Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still \\nvery young.” \\n\\nShe pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and \\neveryone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred \\nor so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were \\ngrowing there in rows. They looked quite \\nunremarkable to Harry, who didn’t have the slightest \\nidea what Hermione meant by the “cry” of the \\nMandrake. \\n\\n“Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,” said Professor \\nSprout. \\n\\nThere was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair \\nthat wasn’t pink and fluffy. \\n\\n“When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears \\nare completely covered,” said Professor Sprout. “When \\nit is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs- \\nup. Right — earmuffs on.” \\n\\nHarry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut \\nout sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, \\nfluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of \\nher robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and \\npulled hard. \\n\\nHarry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could \\nhear. \\n\\nInstead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly \\nbaby popped out of the earth. The leaves were \\ngrowing right out of his head. He had pale green, \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 103 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his \\nlungs. \\n\\nProfessor Sprout took a large plant pot from under \\nthe table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying \\nhim in dark, damp compost until only the tufted \\nleaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her \\nhands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed \\nher own earmuffs. \\n\\n“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries \\nwon’t kill yet,” she said calmly as though she’d just \\ndone nothing more exciting than water a begonia. \\n“However, they will knock you out for several hours, \\nand as I’m sure none of you want to miss your first \\nday back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in \\nplace while you work. I will attract your attention \\nwhen it is time to pack up. \\n\\n“Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here \\n\\n— compost in the sacks over there — and be careful \\nof the Venomous Tentacula, it’s teething.” \\n\\nShe gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as \\nshe spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had \\nbeen inching sneakily over her shoulder. \\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by \\na curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but \\nhad never spoken to. \\n\\n“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking \\nHarry by the hand. “Know who you are, of course, the \\nfamous Harry Potter. ... And you’re Hermione Granger \\n\\n— always top in everything” (Hermione beamed as she \\nhad her hand shaken too) “ — and Ron Weasley. \\nWasn’t that your flying car?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 104 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon didn’t smile. The Howler was obviously still on \\nhis mind. \\n\\n“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he?” said Justin \\nhappily as they began filling their plant pots with \\ndragon dung compost. “Awfully brave chap. Have you \\nread his books? I’d have died of fear if I’d been \\ncornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he \\nstayed cool and — zap — just fantastic. \\n\\n“My name was down for Eton, you know. I can’t tell \\nyou how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, \\nMother was slightly disappointed, but since I made \\nher read Lockhart’s books I think she’s begun to see \\nhow useful it’ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the \\nfamily. ...” \\n\\nAfter that they didn’t have much chance to talk. Their \\nearmuffs were back on and they needed to \\nconcentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had \\nmade it look extremely easy, but it wasn’t. The \\nMandrakes didn’t like coming out of the earth, but \\ndidn’t seem to want to go back into it either. They \\nsquirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and \\ngnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes \\ntrying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot. \\n\\nBy the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was \\nsweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone \\ntraipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then \\nthe Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration. \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall’s classes were always hard \\nwork, but today was especially difficult. Everything \\nHarry had learned last year seemed to have leaked \\nout of his head during the summer. He was supposed \\nto be turning a beetle into a button, but all he \\nmanaged to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as \\nit scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand. \\n\\nPage | 105 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon was having far worse problems. He had patched \\nup his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it \\nseemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept \\ncrackling and sparking at odd moments, and every \\ntime Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed \\nhim in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. \\nUnable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally \\nsquashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for \\na new one. Professor McGonagall wasn’t pleased. \\n\\nHarry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain \\nfelt like a wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the \\nclassroom except him and Ron, who was whacking \\nhis wand furiously on the desk. \\n\\n“Stupid — useless — thing — ” \\n\\n“Write home for another one,” Harry suggested as the \\nwand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker. \\n\\n“Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,” said Ron, \\nstuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. “ ‘It’s your \\nown fault your wand got snapped — ’ ” \\n\\nThey went down to lunch, where Ron’s mood was not \\nimproved by Hermione’s showing them the handful of \\nperfect coat buttons she had produced in \\nT ransfiguration . \\n\\n“What’ve we got this afternoon?” said Harry, hastily \\nchanging the subject. \\n\\n“Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermione at \\nonce. \\n\\n“Why,” demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, “have \\nyou outlined all Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 106 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione snatched the schedule back, blushing \\nfuriously. \\n\\nThey finished lunch and went outside into the \\novercast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone \\nstep and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires \\nagain. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch \\nfor several minutes before Harry became aware that \\nhe was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the \\nvery small, mousy-haired boy he’d seen trying on the \\nSorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though \\ntransfixed. He was clutching what looked like an \\nordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry \\nlooked at him, he went bright red. \\n\\n“All right, Harry? I’m — I’m Colin Creevey,” he said \\nbreathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. “I’m in \\nGryffindor, too. D’you think — would it be all right if \\n— can I have a picture?” he said, raising the camera \\nhopefully. \\n\\n“A picture?” Harry repeated blankly. \\n\\n“So I can prove I’ve met you,” said Colin Creevey \\neagerly, edging further forward. “I know all about you. \\nEveryone’s told me. About how you survived when \\nYou-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he \\ndisappeared and everything and how you’ve still got a \\nlightning scar on your forehead” (his eyes raked \\nHarry’s hairline) “and a boy in my dormitory said if I \\ndevelop the film in the right potion, the pictures’ll \\nmove.” Colin drew a great shuddering breath of \\nexcitement and said, “It’s amazing here, isn’t it? I \\nnever knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I \\ngot the letter from Hogwarts. My dad’s a milkman, he \\ncouldn’t believe it either. So I’m taking loads of \\npictures to send home to him. And it’d be really good \\nif I had one of you” — he looked imploringly at Harry \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 107 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n— “maybe your friend could take it and I could stand \\nnext to you? And then, could you sign it?” \\n\\n“ Signed photos? You’re giving out signed photos, \\nPotter?” \\n\\nLoud and scathing, Draco Malfoy’s voice echoed \\naround the courtyard. He had stopped right behind \\nColin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his \\nlarge and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle. \\n\\n“Everyone line up!” Malfoy roared to the crowd. “Harry \\nPotter’s giving out signed photos!” \\n\\n“No, I’m not,” said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \\n“Shut up, Malfoy.” \\n\\n“You’re just jealous,” piped up Colin, whose entire \\nbody was about as thick as Crabbe ’s neck. \\n\\n“Jealous?” said Malfoy, who didn’t need to shout \\nanymore: Half the courtyard was listening in. “Of \\nwhat? I don’t want a foul scar right across my head, \\nthanks. I don’t think getting your head cut open \\nmakes you that special, myself.” \\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly. \\n\\n“Eat slugs, Malfoy,” said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped \\nlaughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a \\nmenacing way. \\n\\n“Be careful, Weasley,” sneered Malfoy. “You don’t \\nwant to start any trouble or your mommy’ll have to \\ncome and take you away from school.” He put on a \\nshrill, piercing voice. “If you put another toe out of line \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 108 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed loudly \\nat this. \\n\\n“Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,” smirked \\nMalfoy. “It’d be worth more than his family’s whole \\nhouse — ” \\n\\nRon whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione \\nshut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and \\nwhispered, “Look out!” \\n\\n“What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart \\nwas striding toward them, his turquoise robes \\nswirling behind him. “Who’s giving out signed \\nphotos?” \\n\\nHarry started to speak but he was cut short as \\nLockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and \\nthundered jovially, “Shouldn’t have asked! We meet \\nagain, Harry!” \\n\\nPinned to Lockhart’s side and burning with \\nhumiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back \\ninto the crowd. \\n\\n“Come on then, Mr. Creevey,” said Lockhart, beaming \\nat Colin. “A double portrait, can’t do better than that, \\nand well both sign it for you.” \\n\\nColin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as \\nthe bell rang behind them, signaling the start of \\nafternoon classes. \\n\\n“Off you go, move along there,” Lockhart called to the \\ncrowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, \\nwho was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, \\nstill clasped to his side. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 109 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“A word to the wise, Harry,” said Lockhart paternally \\nas they entered the building through a side door. “I \\ncovered up for you back there with young Creevey — \\nif he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates \\nwon’t think you’re setting yourself up so much. ...” \\n\\nDeaf to Harry’s stammers, Lockhart swept him down \\na corridor lined with staring students and up a \\nstaircase. \\n\\n“Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at \\nthis stage of your career isn’t sensible — looks a tad \\nbigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a \\ntime when, like me, you’ll need to keep a stack handy \\nwherever you go, but” — he gave a little chortle — “I \\ndon’t think you’re quite there yet.” \\n\\nThey had reached Lockhart’s classroom and he let \\nHarry go at last. Harry yanked his robes straight and \\nheaded for a seat at the very back of the class, where \\nhe busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart’s \\nbooks in front of him, so that he could avoid looking \\nat the real thing. \\n\\nThe rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and \\nHermione sat down on either side of Harry. \\n\\n“You could’ve fried an egg on your face,” said Ron. \\n“You’d better hope Creevey doesn’t meet Ginny, or \\nthey’ll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.” \\n\\n“Shut up,” snapped Harry. The last thing he needed \\nwas for Lockhart to hear the phrase “Harry Potter fan \\nclub.” \\n\\nWhen the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared \\nhis throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward, \\npicked up Neville Longbottom’s copy of Travels with \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 110 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrolls, and held it up to show his own, winking \\nportrait on the front. \\n\\n“Me,” he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \\n“Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, \\nHonorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, \\nand five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most- \\nCharming- Smile Award — but I don’t talk about that. \\nI didn’t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at \\nher!” \\n\\nHe waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled \\nweakly. \\n\\n“I see you’ve all bought a complete set of my books — \\nwell done. I thought we’d start today with a little quiz. \\nNothing to worry about — just to check how well \\nyou’ve read them, how much you’ve taken in — ” \\n\\nWhen he had handed out the test papers he returned \\nto the front of the class and said, “You have thirty \\nminutes — start — now\\\\” \\n\\nHarry looked down at his paper and read: \\n\\n1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s favorite color? \\n\\n2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s secret ambition? \\n\\n3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart’s \\ngreatest achievement to date? \\n\\nOn and on it went, over three sides of paper, right \\ndown to: \\n\\n54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart’s birthday, and what \\nwould his ideal gift be? \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 111 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHalf an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and \\nrifled through them in front of the class. \\n\\n“Tut, tut — hardly any of you remembered that my \\nfavorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. \\n\\nAnd a few of you need to read Wanderings with \\nWerewolves more carefully — I clearly state in \\nchapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be \\nharmony between all magic and non-magic peoples — \\nthough I wouldn’t say no to a large bottle of Ogden’s \\nOld Firewhisky!” \\n\\nHe gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now \\nstaring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on \\nhis face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who \\nwere sitting in front, were shaking with silent \\nlaughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening \\nto Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when \\nhe mentioned her name. \\n\\n\"... but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret \\nambition is to rid the world of evil and market my \\nown range of hair-care potions — good girl! In fact” — \\nhe flipped her paper over — “full marks! Where is \\nMiss Hermione Granger?” \\n\\nHermione raised a trembling hand. \\n\\n“Excellent!” beamed Lockhart. “Quite excellent! Take \\nten points for Gryffindor! And so — to business — ” \\n\\nHe bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, \\ncovered cage onto it. \\n\\n“Now — be warned! It is my job to arm you against \\nthe foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may \\nfind yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. \\nKnow only that no harm can befall you whilst I am \\nhere. All I ask is that you remain calm.” \\n\\nPage | 112 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of \\nbooks for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a \\nhand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped \\nlaughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row \\nseat. \\n\\n“I must ask you not to scream,” said Lockhart in a \\nlow voice. “It might provoke them.” \\n\\nAs the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped \\noff the cover. \\n\\n“Yes,” he said dramatically. “ Freshly caught Cornish \\npixies.” \\n\\nSeamus Finnigan couldn’t control himself. He let out \\na snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn’t \\nmistake for a scream of terror. \\n\\n“Yes?” He smiled at Seamus. \\n\\n“Well, they’re not — they’re not very — dangerous, are \\nthey?” Seamus choked. \\n\\n“Don’t be so sure!” said Lockhart, waggling a finger \\nannoyingly at Seamus. “Devilish tricky little blighters \\nthey can be!” \\n\\nThe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches \\nhigh, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was \\nlike listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment \\nthe cover had been removed, they had started \\njabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and \\nmaking bizarre faces at the people nearest them. \\n\\n“Right, then,” Lockhart said loudly. “Let’s see what \\nyou make of them!” And he opened the cage. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 113 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every \\ndirection like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by \\nthe ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot \\nstraight through the window, showering the back row \\nwith broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the \\nclassroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. \\nThey grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with \\nthem, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from \\nthe walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags \\nand books and threw them out of the smashed \\nwindow; within minutes, half the class was sheltering \\nunder desks and Neville was swinging from the iron \\nchandelier in the ceiling. \\n\\n“Come on now — round them up, round them up, \\nthey’re only pixies,” Lockhart shouted. \\n\\nHe rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and \\nbellowed, “Peskipiksi Pesternomti” \\n\\nIt had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his \\nwand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart \\ngulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly \\navoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second \\nlater as the chandelier gave way. \\n\\nThe bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the \\nexit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart \\nstraightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \\n“Well, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them \\nback into their cage.” He swept past them and shut \\nthe door quickly behind him. \\n\\n“Can you believe him?” roared Ron as one of the \\nremaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear. \\n\\n“He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,” \\nsaid Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a \\n\\nPage | 114 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into \\ntheir cage. \\n\\n“Hands on?” said Harry, who was trying to grab a \\npixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. \\n“Hermione, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing \\n\\n\\n\\n“Rubbish,” said Hermione. “You’ve read his books — \\nlook at all those amazing things he’s done — ” \\n\\n“He says he’s done,” Ron muttered. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 115 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDBLOODS AND MURMURS \\n\\nHarry spent a lot of time over the next few days \\ndodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy \\nLockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid \\nwas Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized \\nHarry’s schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a \\nbigger thrill than to say, “All right, Harry?” six or \\nseven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,” back, \\nhowever exasperated Harry sounded when he said it. \\n\\nHedwig was still angry with Harry about the \\ndisasterous car journey and Ron’s wand was still \\nmalfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning \\nby shooting out of Ron’s hand in Charms and hitting \\ntiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, \\ncreating a large, throbbing green boil where it had \\nstruck. So with one thing and another, Harry was \\nquite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and \\nHermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday \\nmorning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several \\nhours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver \\nWood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. \\n\\nPage | 116 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets- J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“Whassamatter?” said Harry groggily. \\n\\n“Quidditch practice!” said Wood. “Come on!” \\n\\nHarry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist \\nhanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he \\nwas awake, he couldn’t understand how he could \\nhave slept through the racket the birds were making. \\n\\n“Oliver,” Harry croaked. “It’s the crack of dawn.” \\n\\n“Exactly,” said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth \\nyear and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with \\na crazed enthusiasm. “It’s part of our new training \\nprogram. Come on, grab your broom, and let’s go,” \\nsaid Wood heartily. “None of the other teams have \\nstarted training yet; we’re going to be first off the \\nmark this year — ” \\n\\nYawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of \\nbed and tried to find his Quidditch robes. \\n\\n“Good man,” said Wood. “Meet you on the field in \\nfifteen minutes.” \\n\\nWhen he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on \\nhis cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron \\nexplaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral \\nstaircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two \\nThousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the \\nportrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and \\nColin Creevey came dashing down the spiral \\nstaircase, his camera swinging madly around his \\nneck and something clutched in his hand. \\n\\n“I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, \\nHarry! Look what I’ve got here! I’ve had it developed, I \\nwanted to show you — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 117 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was \\nbrandishing under his nose. \\n\\nA moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard \\non an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was \\npleased to see that his photographic self was putting \\nup a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. \\nAs Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, \\npanting, against the white edge of the picture. \\n\\n“Will you sign it?” said Colin eagerly. \\n\\n“No,” said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that \\nthe room was really deserted. “Sorry, Colin, I’m in a \\nhurry — Quidditch practice — ” \\n\\nHe climbed through the portrait hole. \\n\\n“Oh, wow! Wait for me! I’ve never watched a Quidditch \\ngame before!” \\n\\nColin scrambled through the hole after him. \\n\\n“It’ll be really boring,” Harry said quickly, but Colin \\nignored him, his face shining with excitement. \\n\\n“You were the youngest House player in a hundred \\nyears, weren’t you, Harry? Weren’t you?” said Colin, \\ntrotting alongside him. “You must be brilliant. I’ve \\nnever flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is \\nthat the best one there is?” \\n\\nHarry didn’t know how to get rid of him. It was like \\nhaving an extremely talkative shadow. \\n\\n“I don’t really understand Quidditch,” said Colin \\nbreathlessly. “Is it true there are four balls? And two \\nof them fly around trying to knock people off their \\nbrooms?” \\n\\nPage | 118 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the \\ncomplicated rules of Quidditch. “They’re called \\nBludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who \\ncarry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. \\nFred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.” \\n\\n“And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked, \\ntripping down a couple of steps because he was \\ngazing open-mouthed at Harry. \\n\\n“Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is \\nthe one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each \\nteam throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get \\nit through the goal posts at the end of the pitch — \\nthey’re three long poles with hoops on the end.” \\n\\n“And the fourth ball — ” \\n\\n“ — is the Golden Snitch,” said Harry, “and it’s very \\nsmall, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that’s what \\nthe Seeker’s got to do, because a game of Quidditch \\ndoesn’t end until the Snitch has been caught. And \\nwhichever team’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his \\nteam an extra hundred and fifty points.” \\n\\n“And you’re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said \\nColin in awe. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started \\nacross the dew-drenched grass. “And there’s the \\nKeeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That’s it, \\nreally.” \\n\\nBut Colin didn’t stop questioning Harry all the way \\ndown the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and \\nHarry only shook him off when he reached the \\nchanging rooms; Colin called after him in a piping \\nvoice, “I’ll go and get a good seat, Harry!” and hurried \\noff to the stands. \\n\\nPage | 119 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the \\nchanging room. Wood was the only person who looked \\ntruly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, \\npuffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year \\nAlicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against \\nthe wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell \\nand Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side \\nopposite them. \\n\\n“There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood \\nbriskly. “Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all \\nbefore we actually get onto the field, because I spent \\nthe summer devising a whole new training program, \\nwhich I really think will make all the difference. ...” \\n\\nWood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch \\nfield, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and \\ncrosses in different-colored inks. He took out his \\nwand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to \\nwiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood \\nlaunched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred \\nWeasley’s head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet’s \\nshoulder and he began to snore. \\n\\nThe first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, \\nbut there was another board under that, and a third \\nunder that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood \\ndroned on and on. \\n\\n“So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a \\nwistful fantasy about what he could be eating for \\nbreakfast at this very moment up at the castle. “Is \\nthat clear? Any questions?” \\n\\n“I’ve got a question, Oliver,” said George, who had \\nwoken with a start. “Why couldn’t you have told us all \\nthis yesterday when we were awake?” \\n\\nWood wasn’t pleased. \\n\\nPage | 120 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, listen here, you lot,” he said, glowering at them \\nall. “We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year. \\nWe’re easily the best team. But unfortunately — \\nowing to circumstances beyond our control — ” \\n\\nHarry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been \\nunconscious in the hospital wing for the final match \\nof the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had \\nbeen a player short and had suffered their worst \\ndefeat in three hundred years. \\n\\nWood took a moment to regain control of himself. \\nTheir last defeat was clearly still torturing him. \\n\\n“So this year, we train harder than ever before. ... \\nOkay, let’s go and put our new theories into practice!” \\nWood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the \\nway out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still \\nyawning, his team followed. \\n\\nThey had been in the locker room so long that the \\nsun was up completely now, although remnants of \\nmist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry \\nwalked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione \\nsitting in the stands. \\n\\n“Aren’t you finished yet?” called Ron incredulously. \\n\\n“Haven’t even started,” said Harry, looking jealously \\nat the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had \\nbrought out of the Great Hall. “Wood’s been teaching \\nus new moves.” \\n\\nHe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the \\nground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air \\nwhipped his face, waking him far more effectively \\nthan Wood’s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on \\nthe Quidditch field. He soared right around the \\nstadium at full speed, racing Fred and George. \\n\\nPage | 121 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s that funny clicking noise?” called Fred as \\nthey hurtled around the corner. \\n\\nHarry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one \\nof the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture \\nafter picture, the sound strangely magnified in the \\ndeserted stadium. \\n\\n“Look this way, Harry! This way!” he cried shrilly. \\n“Who’s that?” said Fred. \\n\\n“No idea,” Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that \\ntook him as far away as possible from Colin. \\n\\n“What’s going on?” said Wood, frowning, as he \\nskimmed through the air toward them. “Why’s that \\nfirst year taking pictures? I don’t like it. He could be a \\nSlytherin spy, trying to find out about our new \\ntraining program.” \\n\\n“He’s in Gryffindor,” said Harry quickly. \\n\\n“And the Slytherins don’t need a spy, Oliver,” said \\nGeorge. \\n\\n“What makes you say that?” said Wood testily. \\n\\n“Because they’re here in person,” said George, \\npointing. \\n\\nSeveral people in green robes were walking onto the \\nfield, broomsticks in their hands. \\n\\n“I don’t believe it!” Wood hissed in outrage. “I booked \\nthe field for today! We’ll see about this!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 122 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder \\nthan he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as \\nhe dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed. \\n\\n“Flint!” Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. “This \\nis our practice time! We got up specially! You can \\nclear off now!” \\n\\nMarcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a \\nlook of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, \\n“Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.” \\n\\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There \\nwere no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood \\nshoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering \\nto a man. \\n\\n“But I booked the field!” said Wood, positively spitting \\nwith rage. “I booked it!” \\n\\n“Ah,” said Flint. “But Tve got a specially signed note \\nhere from Professor Snape. % Professor S. Snape, give \\nthe Slytherin team permission to practice today on the \\nQuidditch field owinq to the need to train their new \\nSeeker. ’ ” \\n\\n“You’ve got a new Seeker?” said Wood, distracted. \\n“Where?” \\n\\nAnd from behind the six large figures before them \\ncame a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his \\npale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy. \\n\\n“Aren’t you Lucius Malfoy’s son?” said Fred, looking \\nat Malfoy with dislike. \\n\\n“Funny you should mention Draco’s father,” said Flint \\nas the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 123 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let me show you the generous gift he’s made to the \\nSlytherin team.” \\n\\nAll seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven \\nhighly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of \\nfine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two \\nThousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors’ \\nnoses in the early morning sun. \\n\\n“Very latest model. Only came out last month,” said \\nFlint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end \\nof his own. “I believe it outstrips the old Two \\nThousand series by a considerable amount. As for the \\nold Cleansweeps” — he smiled nastily at Fred and \\nGeorge, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives — \\n“sweeps the board with them.” \\n\\nNone of the Gryffindor team could think of anything \\nto say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly \\nhis cold eyes were reduced to slits. \\n\\n“Oh, look,” said Flint. “A field invasion.” \\n\\nRon and Hermione were crossing the grass to see \\nwhat was going on. \\n\\n“What’s happening?” Ron asked Harry. “Why aren’t \\nyou playing? And what’s he doing here?” \\n\\nHe was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin \\nQuidditch robes. \\n\\n“I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,” said Malfoy, \\nsmugly. “Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms \\nmy father’s bought our team.” \\n\\nRon gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb \\nbroomsticks in front of him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 124 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good, aren’t they?” said Malfoy smoothly. “But \\nperhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some \\ngold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off \\nthose Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would \\nbid for them.” \\n\\nThe Slytherin team howled with laughter. \\n\\n“At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy \\ntheir way in,” said Hermione sharply. “They got in on \\npure talent.” \\n\\nThe smug look on Malfoy’s face flickered. \\n\\n“No one asked your opinion, you filthy little \\nMudblood,” he spat. \\n\\nHarry knew at once that Malfoy had said something \\nreally bad because there was an instant uproar at his \\nwords. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred \\nand George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How \\ndare you\\\\”, and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, \\npulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one, \\nMalfoy!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm at \\nMalfoy’s face. \\n\\nA loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of \\ngreen light shot out of the wrong end of Ron’s wand, \\nhitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling \\nbackward onto the grass. \\n\\n“Ron! Ron! Are you all right?” squealed Hermione. \\n\\nRon opened his mouth to speak, but no words came \\nout. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several \\nslugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap. \\n\\nThe Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. \\n\\nFlint was doubled up, hanging onto his new \\n\\nPage | 125 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbroomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, \\nbanging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were \\ngathered around Ron, who kept belching large, \\nglistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch \\nhim. \\n\\n“We’d better get him to Hagrid’s, it’s nearest,” said \\nHarry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair \\nof them pulled Ron up by the arms. \\n\\n“What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? \\nBut you can cure him, can’t you?” Colin had run \\ndown from his seat and was now dancing alongside \\nthem as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and \\nmore slugs dribbled down his front. \\n\\n“Oooh,” said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. \\n“Can you hold him still, Harry?” \\n\\n“Get out of the way, Colin!” said Harry angrily. He and \\nHermione supported Ron out of the stadium and \\nacross the grounds toward the edge of the forest. \\n\\n“Nearly there, Ron,” said Hermione as the \\ngamekeeper’s cabin came into view. “You’ll be all right \\nin a minute — almost there — ” \\n\\nThey were within twenty feet of Hagrid’s house when \\nthe front door opened, but it wasn’t Hagrid who \\nemerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest \\nmauve today, came striding out. \\n\\n“Quick, behind here,” Harry hissed, dragging Ron \\nbehind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat \\nreluctantly. \\n\\n“It’s a simple matter if you know what you’re doing!” \\nLockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. “If you need \\nhelp, you know where I am! I’ll let you have a copy of \\n\\nPage | 126 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmy book. I’m surprised you haven’t already got one — \\nI’ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!” \\nAnd he strode away toward the castle. \\n\\nHarry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then \\npulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid’s front \\ndoor. They knocked urgently. \\n\\nHagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but \\nhis expression brightened when he saw who it was. \\n\\n“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come \\nin, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor \\nLockhart back again — ” \\n\\nHarry and Hermione supported Ron over the \\nthreshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an \\nenormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily \\nin the other. Hagrid didn’t seem perturbed by Ron’s \\nslug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he \\nlowered Ron into a chair. \\n\\n“Better out than in,” he said cheerfully, plunking a \\nlarge copper basin in front of him. “Get ’em all up, \\nRon.” \\n\\n“I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it \\nto stop,” said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend \\nover the basin. “That’s a difficult curse to work at the \\nbest of times, but with a broken wand — ” \\n\\nHagrid was bustling around making them tea. His \\nboarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry. \\n\\n“What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?” Harry \\nasked, scratching Fang’s ears. \\n\\n“Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well,” \\ngrowled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his \\n\\nPage | 127 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nscrubbed table and setting down the teapot. “Like I \\ndon’ know. An’ bangin’ on about some banshee he \\nbanished. If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle.” \\n\\nIt was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts \\nteacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise. \\nHermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher \\nthan usual, “I think you’re being a bit unfair. \\n\\nProfessor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the \\nbest man for the job — ” \\n\\n“He was the on’y man for the job,” said Hagrid, \\noffering them a plate of treacle toffee, while Ron \\ncoughed squelchily into his basin. “An’ I mean the \\non’y one. Gettin’ very difficult ter find anyone fer the \\nDark Arts job. People aren’t too keen ter take it on, \\nsee. They’re startin’ ter think it’s jinxed. No one’s \\nlasted long fer a while now. So tell me,” said Hagrid, \\njerking his head at Ron. “Who was he tryin’ ter \\ncurse?” \\n\\n“Malfoy called Hermione something — it must’ve been \\nreally bad, because everyone went wild.” \\n\\n“It was bad,” said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the \\ntabletop looking pale and sweaty. “Malfoy called her \\n‘Mudblood,’ Hagrid — ” \\n\\nRon dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs \\nmade their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged. \\n\\n“He didn’!” he growled at Hermione. \\n\\n“He did,” she said. “But I don’t know what it means. I \\ncould tell it was really rude, of course — ” \\n\\n“It’s about the most insulting thing he could think of,” \\ngasped Ron, coming back up. “Mudblood’s a really \\nfoul name for someone who is Muggle-born — you \\n\\nPage | 128 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nknow, non-magic parents. There are some wizards — \\nlike Malfoy’s family — who think they’re better than \\neveryone else because they’re what people call pure- \\nblood.” He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell \\ninto his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin \\nand continued, “I mean, the rest of us know it doesn’t \\nmake any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom \\n— he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a \\ncauldron the right way up.” \\n\\n“An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’ \\ndo,” said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a \\nbrilliant shade of magenta. \\n\\n“It’s a disgusting thing to call someone,” said Ron, \\nwiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. “Dirty \\nblood, see. Common blood. It’s ridiculous. Most \\nwizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we \\nhadn’t married Muggles we’d’ve died out.” \\n\\nHe retched and ducked out of sight again. \\n\\n“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,” \\nsaid Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs \\nhitting the basin. “Bu’ maybe it was a good thing yer \\nwand backfired. ’Spect Lucius Malfoy would’ve come \\nmarchin’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son. Least \\nyer not in trouble.” \\n\\nHarry would have pointed out that trouble didn’t \\ncome much worse than having slugs pouring out of \\nyour mouth, but he couldn’t; Hagrid’s treacle toffee \\nhad cemented his jaws together. \\n\\n“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a \\nsudden thought. “Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I’ve \\nheard you’ve bin givin’ out signed photos. How come I \\nhaven’t got one?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 129 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFurious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart. \\n\\n“I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said \\nhotly. “If Lockhart’s still spreading that around — ” \\n\\nBut then he saw that Hagrid was laughing. \\n\\n“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting Harry genially on the \\nback and sending him face first into the table. “I knew \\nyeh hadn’t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn’ need teh. \\nYer more famous than him without tryin’.” \\n\\n“Bet he didn’t like that,” said Harry, sitting up and \\nrubbing his chin. \\n\\n“Don’ think he did,” said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. \\n“An’ then I told him I’d never read one o’ his books an’ \\nhe decided ter go. Treacle toffee, Ron?” he added as \\nRon reappeared. \\n\\n“No thanks,” said Ron weakly. “Better not risk it.” \\n\\n“Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Hagrid as \\nHarry and Hermione finished the last of their tea. \\n\\nIn the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid ’s house \\nwere a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever \\nseen. Each was the size of a large boulder. \\n\\n“Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Hagrid happily. \\n\\n“Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by \\nthen.” \\n\\n“What’ve you been feeding them?” said Harry. \\n\\nHagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they \\nwere alone. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 130 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, I’ve bin givin’ them — you know — a bit o’ help \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry noticed Hagrid’s flowery pink umbrella leaning \\nagainst the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had \\nreason to believe before now that this umbrella was \\nnot all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression \\nthat Hagrid’s old school wand was concealed inside it. \\nHagrid wasn’t supposed to use magic. He had been \\nexpelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry \\nhad never found out why — any mention of the \\nmatter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and \\nbecome mysteriously deaf until the subject was \\nchanged. \\n\\n“An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?” said Hermione, \\nhalfway between disapproval and amusement. “Well, \\nyou’ve done a good job on them.” \\n\\n“That’s what yer little sister said,” said Hagrid, \\nnodding at Ron. “Met her jus’ yesterday.” Hagrid \\nlooked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. “Said \\nshe was jus’ lookin’ round the grounds, but I reckon \\nshe was hopin’ she might run inter someone else at \\nmy house.” He winked at Harry. “If yeh ask me, she \\nwouldn’ say no ter a signed — ” \\n\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter \\nand the ground was sprayed with slugs. \\n\\n“Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his \\nprecious pumpkins. \\n\\nIt was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had \\none bit of treacle toffee since dawn, he was keen to go \\nback to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid \\nand walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing \\noccasionally, but only bringing up two very small \\nslugs. \\n\\nPage | 131 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall \\nwhen a voice rang out, “There you are, Potter — \\nWeasley.” Professor McGonagall was walking toward \\nthem, looking stern. “You will both do your detentions \\nthis evening.” \\n\\n“What’re we doing, Professor?” said Ron, nervously \\nsuppressing a burp. \\n\\n“ You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room \\nwith Mr. Filch,” said Professor McGonagall. “And no \\nmagic, Weasley — elbow grease.” \\n\\nRon gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed \\nby every student in the school. \\n\\n“And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart \\nanswer his fan mail,” said Professor McGonagall. \\n\\n“Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room, \\ntoo?” said Harry desperately. \\n\\n“Certainly not,” said Professor McGonagall, raising \\nher eyebrows. “Professor Lockhart requested you \\nparticularly. Eight o’clock sharp, both of you.” \\n\\nHarry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states \\nof deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a \\nwell-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression. \\nHarry didn’t enjoy his shepherd’s pie as much as he’d \\nthought. Both he and Ron felt they’d got the worse \\ndeal. \\n\\n“Filch ’ll have me there all night,” said Ron heavily. \\n\\n“No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in \\nthat room. I’m no good at Muggle cleaning.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 132 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’d swap anytime,” said Harry hollowly. “I’ve had \\nloads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering \\nLockhart’s fan mail ... he’ll be a nightmare. ...” \\n\\nSaturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what \\nseemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and \\nHarry was dragging his feet along the second-floor \\ncorridor to Lockhart’s office. He gritted his teeth and \\nknocked. \\n\\nThe door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at \\nhim. \\n\\n“Ah, here’s the scalawag!” he said. “Come in, Harry, \\ncome in — ” \\n\\nShining brightly on the walls by the light of many \\ncandles were countless framed photographs of \\nLockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another \\nlarge pile lay on his desk. \\n\\n“You can address the envelopes!” Lockhart told Harry, \\nas though this was a huge treat. “This first one’s to \\nGladys Gudgeon, bless her — huge fan of mine — ” \\n\\nThe minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart’s voice \\nwash over him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and \\n“Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he caught a phrase \\nlike, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Harry,” or “Celebrity is as \\ncelebrity does, remember that.” \\n\\nThe candles burned lower and lower, making the light \\ndance over the many moving faces of Lockhart \\nwatching him. Harry moved his aching hand over \\nwhat felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out \\nVeronica Smethley’s address. It must be nearly time to \\nleave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly \\ntime. ... \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 133 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then he heard something — something quite \\napart from the spitting of the dying candles and \\nLockhart’s prattle about his fans. \\n\\nIt was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a \\nvoice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom. \\n\\n“Come ... come to me. ... Let me rip you. ... Let me tear \\nyou. ... Let me kill you. ...” \\n\\nHarry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot \\nappeared on Veronica Smethley’s street. \\n\\n“What?” he said loudly. \\n\\n“I know!” said Lockhart. “Six solid months at the top \\nof the best-seller list! Broke all records!” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry frantically. “That voice!” \\n\\n“Sorry?” said Lockhart, looking puzzled. “What voice?” \\n\\n“That — that voice that said — didn’t you hear it?” \\n\\nLockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment. \\n\\n“What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you’re \\ngetting a little drowsy? Great Scott — look at the time! \\n“We’ve been here nearly four hours! I’d never have \\nbelieved it — the time’s flown, hasn’t it?” \\n\\nHarry didn’t answer. He was straining his ears to hear \\nthe voice again, but there was no sound now except \\nfor Lockhart telling him he mustn’t expect a treat like \\nthis every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry \\nleft. \\n\\nIt was so late that the Gryffindor common room was \\nalmost empty. Harry went straight up to the \\n\\nPage | 134 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndormitory. Ron wasn’t back yet. Harry pulled on his \\npajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, \\nRon arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a \\nstrong smell of polish into the darkened room. \\n\\n“My muscles have all seized up,” he groaned, sinking \\non his bed. “Fourteen times he made me buff up that \\nQuidditch Cup before he was satisfied. And then I \\nhad another slug attack all over a Special Award for \\nServices to the School. Took ages to get the slime off. \\n\\n. . . How was it with Lockhart?” \\n\\nKeeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, \\nand Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had \\nheard. \\n\\n“And Lockhart said he couldn’t hear it?” said Ron. \\nHarry could see him frowning in the moonlight. \\n\\n“D’you think he was lying? But I don’t get it — even \\nsomeone invisible would’ve had to open the door.” \\n\\n“I know,” said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and \\nstaring at the canopy above him. “I don’t get it either.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 135 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE DEATHDAY PARTY \\n\\nOctober arrived, spreading a damp chill over the \\ngrounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the \\nnurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds \\namong the staff and students. Her Pepperup Potion \\nworked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking \\nat the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny \\nWeasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into \\ntaking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under \\nher vivid hair gave the impression that her whole \\nhead was on fire. \\n\\nRaindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle \\nwindows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower \\nbeds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid’s \\npumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver \\nWood’s enthusiasm for regular training sessions, \\nhowever, was not dampened, which was why Harry \\nwas to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon \\na few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor \\nTower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud. \\nEven aside from the rain and wind it hadn’t been a \\nhappy practice session. Fred and George, who had \\nPage | 136 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nbeen spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for \\nthemselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two \\nThousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin \\nteam was no more than seven greenish blurs, \\nshooting through the air like missiles. \\n\\nAs Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he \\ncame across somebody who looked just as \\npreoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the \\nghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of \\na window, muttering under his breath, \"... don’t fulfill \\ntheir requirements ... half an inch, if that ...” \\n\\n“Hello, Nick,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Hello, hello,” said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and \\nlooking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his \\nlong curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which \\nconcealed the fact that his neck was almost \\ncompletely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry \\ncould see right through him to the dark sky and \\ntorrential rain outside. \\n\\n“You look troubled, young Potter,” said Nick, folding a \\ntransparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside \\nhis doublet. \\n\\n“So do you,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Ah,” Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, “a \\nmatter of no importance. ... It’s not as though I really \\nwanted to join. ... Thought I’d apply, but apparently I \\n‘don’t fulfill requirements’ — ” \\n\\nIn spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great \\nbitterness on his face. \\n\\n“But you would think, wouldn’t you,” he erupted \\nsuddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, \\n\\nPage | 137 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a \\nblunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless \\nHunt?” \\n\\n“Oh — yes,” said Harry, who was obviously supposed \\nto agree. \\n\\n“I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all \\nbeen quick and clean, and my head had come off \\nproperly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal \\nof pain and ridicule. However — ” Nearly Headless \\nNick shook his letter open and read furiously: \\n\\n“ ‘We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have \\nparted company with their bodies. You will appreciate \\nthat it would be impossible otherwise for members to \\nparticipate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head- \\nJuggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, \\ntherefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill \\nour requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick \\nDelaney -Podmore.’ ” \\n\\nFuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away. \\n\\n“Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, \\nHarry! Most people would think that’s good and \\nbeheaded, but oh, no, it’s not enough for Sir Properly \\nDecapitated-Podmore . ” \\n\\nNearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and \\nthen said, in a far calmer tone, “So — what’s \\nbothering you? Anything I can do?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry. “Not unless you know where we can \\nget seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for \\nour match against Sly — ” \\n\\nThe rest of Harry’s sentence was drowned out by a \\nhigh-pitched mewling from somewhere near his \\n\\nPage | 138 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into \\na pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the \\nskeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, \\n\\nArgus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle \\nagainst students. \\n\\n“You’d better get out of here, Harry,” said Nick \\nquickly. “Filch isn’t in a good mood — he’s got the flu \\nand some third years accidentally plastered frog \\nbrains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He’s been \\ncleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud \\nall over the place — ” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry, backing away from the accusing \\nstare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn \\nto the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to \\nconnect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst \\nsuddenly through a tapestry to Harry’s right, \\nwheezing and looking wildly about for the rule- \\nbreaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around \\nhis head, and his nose was unusually purple. \\n\\n“Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes \\npopping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy \\npuddle that had dripped from Harry’s Quidditch \\nrobes. “Mess and muck everywhere! I’ve had enough \\nof it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!” \\n\\nSo Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless \\nNick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the \\nnumber of muddy footprints on the floor. \\n\\nHarry had never been inside Filch’s office before; it \\nwas a place most students avoided. The room was \\ndingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp \\ndangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried \\nfish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets \\nstood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could \\nsee that they contained details of every pupil Filch \\nPage | 139 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhad ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an \\nentire drawer to themselves. A highly polished \\ncollection of chains and manacles hung on the wall \\nbehind Filch’s desk. It was common knowledge that \\nhe was always begging Dumbledore to let him \\nsuspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. \\n\\nFilch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and \\nbegan shuffling around looking for parchment. \\n\\n“Dung,” he muttered furiously, “great sizzling dragon \\nbogies ... frog brains ... rat intestines ... I’ve had \\nenough of it ... make an example ... where’s the form \\n... yes ...” \\n\\nHe retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk \\ndrawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping \\nhis long black quill into the ink pot. \\n\\n“ Name ... Harry Potter. Crime ...” \\n\\n“It was only a bit of mud!” said Harry. \\n\\n“It’s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it’s an \\nextra hour scrubbing!” shouted Filch, a drip shivering \\nunpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. “Crime \\n... befouling the castle ... suggested sentence ...” \\n\\nDabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted \\nunpleasantly at Harry, who waited with bated breath \\nfor his sentence to fall. \\n\\nBut as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great \\nBANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil \\nlamp rattle. \\n\\n“PEEVES!” Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a \\ntransport of rage. “I’ll have you this time, I’ll have \\nyou!” \\n\\nPage | 140 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets- J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran \\nflat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking \\nalongside him. \\n\\nPeeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne \\nmenace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry \\ndidn’t much like Peeves, but couldn’t help feeling \\ngrateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves \\nhad done (and it sounded as though he’d wrecked \\nsomething very big this time) would distract Filch \\nfrom Harry. \\n\\nThinking that he should probably wait for Filch to \\ncome back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next \\nto the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from \\nhis half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple \\nenvelope with silver lettering on the front. With a \\nquick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn’t on \\nhis way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: \\n\\nKWIKSPELL \\n\\nA Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic \\n\\nIntrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled \\nout the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver \\nwriting on the front page said: \\n\\nFeel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find \\nyourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? \\nEver been taunted for your woeful wandwork? \\n\\nThere is an answer! \\n\\nKwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy- \\nlearn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have \\nbenefited from the Kwikspell method! \\n\\n\\n\\nMadam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \\n\\nPage | 141 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I had no memory for incantations and my potions \\nwere a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am \\nthe center of attention at parties and friends beg for the \\nrecipe of my Scintillation Solution!” \\n\\nWarlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \\n\\n“My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one \\nmonth into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I \\nsucceeded in turning her into a yak! \\n\\nThank you, Kwikspell!” \\n\\nFascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the \\nenvelope’s contents. Why on earth did Filch want a \\nKwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn’t a proper \\nwizard? Harry was just reading “Lesson One: Holding \\nYour Wand (Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling \\nfootsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. \\nStuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry \\nthrew it back onto the desk just as the door opened. \\n\\nFilch was looking triumphant. \\n\\n“That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he \\nwas saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. “We’ll have Peeves \\nout this time, my sweet — ” \\n\\nHis eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the \\nKwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, \\nwas lying two feet away from where it had started. \\n\\nFilch ’s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced \\nhimself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across \\nto his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it \\ninto a drawer. \\n\\n“Have you — did you read — ?” he sputtered. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 142 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” Harry lied quickly. \\n\\nFilch ’s knobbly hands were twisting together. \\n\\n“If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s \\nmine — for a friend — be that as it may — however — \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never \\nlooked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was \\ngoing in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan \\nscarf didn’t help. \\n\\n“Very well — go — and don’t breathe a word — not \\nthat — however, if you didn’t read — go now, I have to \\nwrite up Peeves’ report — go — ” \\n\\nAmazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up \\nthe corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from \\nFilch ’s office without punishment was probably some \\nkind of school record. \\n\\n“Harry! Harry! Did it work?” \\n\\nNearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. \\nBehind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large \\nblack-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been \\ndropped from a great height. \\n\\n“I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch’s \\noffice,” said Nick eagerly. “Thought it might distract \\nhim — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Was that you?” said Harry gratefully. “Yeah, it \\nworked, I didn’t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!” \\n\\nThey set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless \\nNick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick’s \\nrejection letter. \\n\\nPage | 143 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wish there was something I could do for you about \\nthe Headless Hunt,” Harry said. \\n\\n\\n\\nNearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry \\nwalked right through him. He wished he hadn’t; it \\nwas like stepping through an icy shower. \\n\\n“But there is something you could do for me,” said \\nNick excitedly. “Harry — would I be asking too much \\n— but no, you wouldn’t want — ” \\n\\n“What is it?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth \\ndeathday,” said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing \\nhimself up and looking dignified. \\n\\n“Oh,” said Harry, not sure whether he should look \\nsorry or happy about this. “Right.” \\n\\n“I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier \\ndungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the \\ncountry. It would be such an honor if you would \\nattend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most \\nwelcome, too, of course — but I daresay you’d rather \\ngo to the school feast?” He watched Harry on \\ntenterhooks. \\n\\n“No,” said Harry quickly, “I’ll come — ” \\n\\n“My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! \\nAnd” — he hesitated, looking excited — “do you think \\nyou could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very \\nfrightening and impressive you find me?” \\n\\n“Of — of course,” said Harry. \\n\\nNearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 144 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“A deathday party?” said Hermione keenly when \\nHarry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in \\nthe common room. “I bet there aren’t many living \\npeople who can say they’ve been to one of those — it’ll \\nbe fascinating!” \\n\\n“Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they \\ndied?” said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions \\nhomework and grumpy. “Sounds dead depressing to \\nme....” \\n\\nRain was still lashing the windows, which were now \\ninky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. \\nThe firelight glowed over the countless squashy \\narmchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing \\nhomework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, \\ntrying to find out what would happen if you fed a \\nFilibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \\n“rescued” the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard \\nfrom a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was \\nnow smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a \\nknot of curious people. \\n\\nHarry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione \\nabout Filch and the Kwikspell course when the \\nsalamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting \\nloud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the \\nroom. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at \\nFred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine \\nstars showering from the salamander’s mouth, and its \\nescape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, \\ndrove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from \\nHarry’s mind. \\n\\nBy the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting \\nhis rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest \\nof the school was happily anticipating their Halloween \\nfeast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the \\nusual live bats, Hagrid’s vast pumpkins had been \\nPage | 145 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncarved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit \\nin, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had \\nbooked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the \\nentertainment. \\n\\n“A promise is a promise,” Hermione reminded Harry \\nbossily. “You said you’d go to the deathday party.” \\n\\nSo at seven o’clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked \\nstraight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, \\nwhich was glittering invitingly with gold plates and \\ncandles, and directed their steps instead toward the \\ndungeons. \\n\\nThe passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick’s \\nparty had been lined with candles, too, though the \\neffect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, \\njet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a \\ndim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The \\ntemperature dropped with every step they took. As \\nHarry shivered and drew his robes tightly around \\nhim, he heard what sounded like a thousand \\nfingernails scraping an enormous blackboard. \\n\\n“Is that supposed to be music?” Ron whispered. They \\nturned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick \\nstanding at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes. \\n\\n“My dear friends,” he said mournfully. “Welcome, \\nwelcome ... so pleased you could come. ...” \\n\\nHe swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside. \\n\\nIt was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of \\nhundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly \\ndrifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the \\ndreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, \\nplayed by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped \\nplatform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue \\nPage | 146 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith a thousand more black candles. Their breath \\nrose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a \\nfreezer. \\n\\n“Shall we have a look around?” Harry suggested, \\nwanting to warm up his feet. \\n\\n“Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Ron \\nnervously, and they set off around the edge of the \\ndance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a \\nragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a \\ncheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight \\nwith an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry \\nwasn’t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a \\ngaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver \\nbloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the \\nother ghosts. \\n\\n“Oh, no,” said Hermione, stopping abruptly. “Turn \\nback, turn back, I don’t want to talk to Moaning \\nMyrtle — ” \\n\\n“Who?” said Harry as they backtracked quickly. \\n\\n“She haunts one of the toilets in the girls’ bathroom \\non the first floor,” said Hermione. \\n\\n“She haunts a toilet ?” \\n\\n“Yes. It’s been out-of-order all year because she keeps \\nhaving tantrums and flooding the place. I never went \\nin there anyway if I could avoid it; it’s awful trying to \\nhave a pee with her wailing at you — ” \\n\\n“Look, food!” said Ron. \\n\\nOn the other side of the dungeon was a long table, \\nalso covered in black velvet. They approached it \\neagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, \\n\\nPage | 147 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhorrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, \\nrotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; \\ncakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on \\nsalvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of \\ncheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of \\nplace, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a \\ntombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, \\n\\nSIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON \\nDIED 3 1 ST OCTOBER, 1 492 \\n\\nHarry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached \\nthe table, crouched low, and walked through it, his \\nmouth held wide so that it passed through one of the \\nstinking salmon. \\n\\n“Can you taste it if you walk through it?” Harry asked \\nhim. \\n\\n“Almost,” said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away. \\n\\n“I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,” \\nsaid Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and \\nleaning closer to look at the putrid haggis. \\n\\n“Can we move? I feel sick,” said Ron. \\n\\nThey had barely turned around, however, when a \\nlittle man swooped suddenly from under the table and \\ncame to a halt in midair before them. \\n\\n“Hello, Peeves,” said Harry cautiously. \\n\\nUnlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist \\nwas the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was \\nwearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, \\nand a broad grin on his wide, wicked face. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 148 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nibbles?” he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of \\npeanuts covered in fungus. \\n\\n“No thanks,” said Hermione. \\n\\n“Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,” said Peeves, \\nhis eyes dancing. “Rude you was about poor Myrtle.” \\nHe took a deep breath and bellowed, “OY! MYRTLE!” \\n\\n“Oh, no, Peeves, don’t tell her what I said, she’ll be \\nreally upset,” Hermione whispered frantically. “I didn’t \\nmean it, I don’t mind her — er, hello, Myrtle.” \\n\\nThe squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the \\nglummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden \\nbehind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles. \\n\\n“What?” she said sulkily. \\n\\n“How are you, Myrtle?” said Hermione in a falsely \\nbright voice. “It’s nice to see you out of the toilet.” \\n\\nMyrtle sniffed. \\n\\n“Miss Granger was just talking about you — ” said \\nPeeves slyly in Myrtle’s ear. \\n\\n“Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight,” \\nsaid Hermione, glaring at Peeves. \\n\\nMyrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously. \\n\\n“You’re making fun of me,” she said, silver tears \\nwelling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes. \\n\\n“No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s \\nlooking?” said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron \\npainfully in the ribs. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 149 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yeah — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“She did — ” \\n\\n“Don’t lie to me,” Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding \\ndown her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her \\nshoulder. “D’you think I don’t know what people call \\nme behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! \\nMiserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!” \\n\\n“You’ve forgotten pimply,” Peeves hissed in her ear. \\n\\nMoaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled \\nfrom the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her \\nwith moldy peanuts, yelling, “Pimply\\\\ Pimplyl” \\n\\n“Oh, dear,” said Hermione sadly. \\n\\nNearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them \\nthrough the crowd. \\n\\n“Enjoying yourselves?” \\n\\n“Oh, yes,” they lied. \\n\\n“Not a bad turnout,” said Nearly Headless Nick \\nproudly. “The Wailing Widow came all the way up \\nfrom Kent. ... It’s nearly time for my speech, I’d better \\ngo and warn the orchestra. ...” \\n\\nThe orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very \\nmoment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell \\nsilent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting \\nhorn sounded. \\n\\n“Oh, here we go,” said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly. \\n\\nThrough the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost \\nhorses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The \\n\\nPage | 150 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nassembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, \\nbut stopped quickly at the sight of Nick’s face. \\n\\nThe horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor \\nand halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the \\npack was a large ghost who held his bearded head \\nunder his arm, from which position he was blowing \\nthe horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high \\nin the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone \\nlaughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, \\nsquashing his head back onto his neck. \\n\\n“Nick!” he roared. “How are you? Head still hanging in \\nthere?” \\n\\nHe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless \\nNick on the shoulder. \\n\\n“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly. \\n\\n“Live ’uns!” said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione and giving a huge, fake jump of \\nastonishment, so that his head fell off again (the \\ncrowd howled with laughter). \\n\\n“Very amusing,” said Nearly Headless Nick darkly. \\n\\n“Don’t mind Nick!” shouted Sir Patrick’s head from \\nthe floor. “Still upset we won’t let him join the Hunt! \\nBut I mean to say — look at the fellow — ” \\n\\n“I think,” said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look \\nfrom Nick, “Nick’s very — frightening and — er — ” \\n\\n“Ha!” yelled Sir Patrick’s head. “Bet he asked you to \\nsay that!” \\n\\n“If I could have everyone’s attention, it’s time for my \\nspeech!” said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding \\n\\nPage | 151 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoward the podium and climbing into an icy blue \\nspotlight. \\n\\n“My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is \\nmy great sorrow ...” \\n\\nBut nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the \\nrest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of \\nHead Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. \\nNearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his \\naudience, but gave up as Sir Patrick’s head went \\nsailing past him to loud cheers. \\n\\nHarry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry. \\n\\n“I can’t stand much more of this,” Ron muttered, his \\nteeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into \\naction and the ghosts swept back onto the dance \\nfloor. \\n\\n“Let’s go,” Harry agreed. \\n\\nThey backed toward the door, nodding and beaming \\nat anyone who looked at them, and a minute later \\nwere hurrying back up the passageway full of black \\ncandles. \\n\\n“Pudding might not be finished yet,” said Ron \\nhopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the \\nentrance hall. \\n\\nAnd then Harry heard it. \\n\\n\"... rip ... tear ... kill ...” \\n\\nIt was the same voice, the same cold, murderous \\nvoice he had heard in Lockhart’s office. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 152 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, \\nlistening with all his might, looking around, squinting \\nup and down the dimly lit passageway. \\n\\n“Harry, what’re you — ?” \\n\\n“It’s that voice again — shut up a minute — ” \\n\\nsoo hungry ... for so long ...” \\n\\n“Listen!” said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione \\nfroze, watching him. \\n\\n“... kill ... time to kill ...” \\n\\nThe voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was \\nmoving away — moving upward. A mixture of fear and \\nexcitement gripped him as he stared at the dark \\nceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a \\nphantom, to whom stone ceilings didn’t matter? \\n\\n“This way,” he shouted, and he began to run, up the \\nstairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to \\nhear anything here, the babble of talk from the \\nHalloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. \\nHarry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first \\nfloor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him. \\n\\n“Harry, what’re we — ” \\n\\n“SHH!” \\n\\nHarry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor \\nabove, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: \\n“...I smell blood. ...I SMELL BLOOD\\\\” \\n\\nHis stomach lurched — \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 153 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring \\nRon’s and Hermione’s bewildered faces, he ran up the \\nnext flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen \\nover his own pounding footsteps — \\n\\nHarry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, \\nRon and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping \\nuntil they turned a corner into the last, deserted \\npassage. \\n\\n“Harry, what was that all about?” said Ron, wiping \\nsweat off his face. “I couldn’t hear anything. ...” \\n\\nBut Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the \\ncorridor. \\n\\n“Loo/c!” \\n\\nSomething was shining on the wall ahead. They \\napproached slowly, squinting through the darkness. \\nFoot-high words had been daubed on the wall \\nbetween two windows, shimmering in the light cast by \\nthe flaming torches. \\n\\nTHE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. \\nENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE. \\n\\n“What’s that thing — hanging underneath?” said Ron, \\na slight quiver in his voice. \\n\\nAs they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped — there \\nwas a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and \\nHermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the \\nmessage, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All \\nthree of them realized what it was at once, and leapt \\nbackward with a splash. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 154 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Norris, the caretaker’s cat, was hanging by her \\ntail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, \\nher eyes wide and staring. \\n\\nFor a few seconds, they didn’t move. Then Ron said, \\n“Let’s get out of here.” \\n\\n“Shouldn’t we try and help — ” Harry began \\nawkwardly. \\n\\n“Trust me,” said Ron. “We don’t want to be found \\nhere.” \\n\\nBut it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant \\nthunder, told them that the feast had just ended. \\nFrom either end of the corridor where they stood \\ncame the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the \\nstairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; \\nnext moment, students were crashing into the \\npassage from both ends. \\n\\nThe chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as \\nthe people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, \\nRon, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the \\ncorridor, as silence fell among the mass of students \\npressing forward to see the grisly sight. \\n\\nThen someone shouted through the quiet. \\n\\n“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, \\nMudbloods!” \\n\\nIt was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of \\nthe crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless \\nface flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the \\nhanging, immobile cat. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 155 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WRITING ON THE WALL \\n\\n“What’s going on here? What’s going on?” \\n\\nAttracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch \\ncame shouldering his way through the crowd. Then \\nhe saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in \\nhorror. \\n\\n“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he \\nshrieked. \\n\\nAnd his popping eyes fell on Harry. \\n\\n“You!” he screeched. “You! You’ve murdered my cat! \\nYou’ve killed her! I’ll kill you! I’ll — ” \\n\\n“Argus\\'.” \\n\\nDumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a \\nnumber of other teachers. In seconds, he had swept \\npast Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs. \\nNorris from the torch bracket. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 156 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“Come with me, Argus,” he said to Filch. “You, too, \\n\\nMr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.” \\n\\nLockhart stepped forward eagerly. \\n\\n“My office is nearest, Headmaster — just upstairs — \\nplease feel free — ” \\n\\n“Thank you, Gilderoy,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\nThe silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, \\nlooking excited and important, hurried after \\nDumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and \\nSnape. \\n\\nAs they entered Lockhart’s darkened office there was \\na flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw \\nseveral of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of \\nsight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the \\ncandles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore laid \\nMrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to \\nexamine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged \\ntense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of \\ncandlelight, watching. \\n\\nThe tip of Dumbledore ’s long, crooked nose was \\nbarely an inch from Mrs. Norris’s fur. He was looking \\nat her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his \\nlong fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor \\nMcGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes \\nnarrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in \\nshadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was \\nas though he was trying hard not to smile. And \\nLockhart was hovering around all of them, making \\nsuggestions. \\n\\n“It was definitely a curse that killed her — probably \\nthe Trans-mogrifian Torture — I’ve seen it used many \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 157 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntimes, so unlucky I wasn’t there, I know the very \\ncountercurse that would have saved her. ...” \\n\\nLockhart’s comments were punctuated by Filch ’s dry, \\nracking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk, \\nunable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands. \\nMuch as he detested Filch, Harry couldn’t help feeling \\na bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he \\nfelt for himself. If Dumbledore believed Filch, he \\nwould be expelled for sure. \\n\\nDumbledore was now muttering strange words under \\nhis breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but \\nnothing happened: She continued to look as though \\nshe had been recently stuffed. \\n\\n\"... I remember something very similar happening in \\nOuagadougou,” said Lockhart, “a series of attacks, \\nthe full story’s in my autobiography, I was able to \\nprovide the townsfolk with various amulets, which \\ncleared the matter up at once. ...” \\n\\nThe photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all \\nnodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had \\nforgotten to remove his hair net. \\n\\nAt last Dumbledore straightened up. \\n\\n“She’s not dead, Argus,” he said softly. \\n\\nLockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting \\nthe number of murders he had prevented. \\n\\n“Not dead?” choked Filch, looking through his fingers \\nat Mrs. Norris. “But why’s she all — all stiff and \\nfrozen?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 158 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“She has been Petrified,” said Dumbledore (“Ah! I \\nthought so!” said Lockhart). “But how, I cannot say. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Ask him\\\\” shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and \\ntearstained face to Harry. \\n\\n“No second year could have done this,” said \\nDumbledore firmly. “It would take Dark Magic of the \\nmost advanced — ” \\n\\n“He did it, he did it!” Filch spat, his pouchy face \\npurpling. “You saw what he wrote on the wall! He \\nfound — in my office — he knows I’m a — I’m a — ” \\nFilch ’s face worked horribly. “He knows I’m a Squib!” \\nhe finished. \\n\\n“I never touched Mrs. Norris!” Harry said loudly, \\nuncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, \\nincluding all the Lockharts on the walls. “And I don’t \\neven know what a Squib is.” \\n\\n“Rubbish!” snarled Filch. “He saw my Kwikspell \\nletter!” \\n\\n“If I might speak, Headmaster,” said Snape from the \\nshadows, and Harry’s sense of foreboding increased; \\nhe was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to \\ndo him any good. \\n\\n“Potter and his friends may have simply been in the \\nwrong place at the wrong time,” he said, a slight sneer \\ncurling his mouth as though he doubted it. “But we \\ndo have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why \\nwas he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn’t he \\nat the Halloween feast?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 159 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an \\nexplanation about the deathday party. \"... there were \\nhundreds of ghosts, they’ll tell you we were there — ” \\n\\n“But why not join the feast afterward?” said Snape, \\nhis black eyes glittering in the candlelight. “Why go \\nup to that corridor?” \\n\\nRon and Hermione looked at Harry. \\n\\n“Because — because — ” Harry said, his heart \\nthumping very fast; something told him it would \\nsound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led \\nthere by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, \\n“because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,” he \\nsaid. \\n\\n“Without any supper?” said Snape, a triumphant \\nsmile flickering across his gaunt face. “I didn’t think \\nghosts provided food fit for living people at their \\nparties.” \\n\\n“We weren’t hungry,” said Ron loudly as his stomach \\ngave a huge rumble. \\n\\nSnape’s nasty smile widened. \\n\\n“I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being \\nentirely truthful,” he said. “It might be a good idea if \\nhe were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready \\nto tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should \\nbe taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is \\nready to be honest.” \\n\\n“Really, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall sharply, \\n“I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. \\nThis cat wasn’t hit over the head with a broomstick. \\nThere is no evidence at all that Potter has done \\nanything wrong.” \\n\\nPage | 160 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His \\ntwinkling light-blue gaze made Harry feel as though \\nhe were being X-rayed. \\n\\n“Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,” he said \\nfirmly. \\n\\nSnape looked furious. So did Filch. \\n\\n“My cat has been Petrified!” he shrieked, his eyes \\npopping. “I want to see some punishmenti” \\n\\n“We will be able to cure her, Argus,” said Dumbledore \\npatiently. “Professer Sprout recently managed to \\nprocure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have \\nreached their full size, I will have a potion made that \\nwill revive Mrs. Norris.” \\n\\n“I’ll make it,” Lockhart butted in. “I must have done it \\na hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake \\nRestorative Draught in my sleep — ” \\n\\n“Excuse me,” said Snape icily. “But I believe I am the \\nPotions master at this school.” \\n\\nThere was a very awkward pause. \\n\\n“You may go,” Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione. \\n\\nThey went, as quickly as they could without actually \\nrunning. When they were a floor up from Lockhart’s \\noffice, they turned into an empty classroom and \\nclosed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted \\nat his friends’ darkened faces. \\n\\n“D’you think I should have told them about that voice \\nI heard?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 161 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” said Ron, without hesitation. “Hearing voices no \\none else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the \\nwizarding world.” \\n\\nSomething in Ron’s voice made Harry ask, “You do \\nbelieve me, don’t you?” \\n\\n“ ’Course I do,” said Ron quickly. “But — you must \\nadmit it’s weird. ...” \\n\\n“I know it’s weird,” said Harry. “The whole thing’s \\nweird. What was that writing on the wall about? The \\nChamber Has Been Opened’. ... What’s that supposed \\nto mean?” \\n\\n“You know, it rings a sort of bell,” said Ron slowly. “I \\nthink someone told me a story about a secret \\nchamber at Hogwarts once ... might’ve been Bill. ...” \\n\\n“And what on earth’s a Squib?” said Harry. \\n\\nTo his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger. \\n\\n“Well — it’s not funny really — but as it’s Filch,” he \\nsaid. “A Squib is someone who was born into a \\nwizarding family but hasn’t got any magic powers. \\nKind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but \\nSquibs are quite unusual. If Filch ’s trying to learn \\nmagic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a \\nSquib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates \\nstudents so much.” Ron gave a satisfied smile. “He’s \\nbitter.” \\n\\nA clock chimed somewhere. \\n\\n“Midnight,” said Harry. “We’d better get to bed before \\nSnape comes along and tries to frame us for \\nsomething else.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 162 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a few days, the school could talk of little else but \\nthe attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in \\neveryone’s minds by pacing the spot where she had \\nbeen attacked, as though he thought the attacker \\nmight come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the \\nmessage on the wall with Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose \\nMagical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words \\nstill gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When \\nFilch wasn’t guarding the scene of the crime, he was \\nskulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out \\nat unsuspecting students and trying to put them in \\ndetention for things like “breathing loudly” and \\n“looking happy.” \\n\\nGinny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. \\n\\nNorris’s fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat \\nlover. \\n\\n“But you haven’t really got to know Mrs. Norris,” Ron \\ntold her bracingly. “Honestly, we’re much better off \\nwithout her.” Ginny ’s lip trembled. “Stuff like this \\ndoesn’t often happen at Hogwarts,” Ron assured her. \\n“They’ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out \\nof here in no time. I just hope he’s got time to Petrify \\nFilch before he’s expelled. I’m only joking — ” Ron \\nadded hastily as Ginny blanched. \\n\\nThe attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was \\nquite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time \\nreading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. \\nNor could Harry and Ron get much response from her \\nwhen they asked what she was up to, and not until \\nthe following Wednesday did they find out. \\n\\nHarry had been held back in Potions, where Snape \\nhad made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 163 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to \\nmeet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch- \\nFletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming \\ntoward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say \\nhello when Justin caught sight of him, turned \\nabruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction. \\n\\nHarry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring \\nhis History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had \\nasked for a three-foot-long composition on “The \\nMedieval Assembly of European Wizards.” \\n\\n“I don’t believe it, I’m still eight inches short. ...” said \\nRon furiously, letting go of his parchment, which \\nsprang back into a roll. “And Hermione’s done four \\nfeet seven inches and her writing’s tiny.” \\n\\n“Where is she?” asked Harry, grabbing the tape \\nmeasure and unrolling his own homework. \\n\\n“Somewhere over there,” said Ron, pointing along the \\nshelves. “Looking for another book. I think she’s \\ntrying to read the whole library before Christmas.” \\n\\nHarry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running \\naway from him. \\n\\n“Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an \\nidiot,” said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing \\nas large as possible. “All that junk about Lockhart \\nbeing so great — ” \\n\\nHermione emerged from between the bookshelves. \\n\\nShe looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk \\nto them. \\n\\n“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken \\nout,” she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. \\n“And there’s a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn’t \\n\\nPage | 164 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleft my copy at home, but I couldn’t fit it in my trunk \\nwith all the Lockhart books.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Why do you want it?” said Harry. \\n\\n“The same reason everyone else wants it,” said \\nHermione, “to read up on the legend of the Chamber \\nof Secrets.” \\n\\n“What’s that?” said Harry quickly. \\n\\n“That’s just it. I can’t remember,” said Hermione, \\nbiting her lip. “And I can’t find the story anywhere \\nelse — ” \\n\\n“Hermione, let me read your composition,” said Ron \\ndesperately, checking his watch. \\n\\n“No, I won’t,” said Hermione, suddenly severe. “You’ve \\nhad ten days to finish it — ” \\n\\n“I only need another two inches, come on — ” \\n\\nThe bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to \\nHistory of Magic, bickering. \\n\\nHistory of Magic was the dullest subject on their \\nschedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their \\nonly ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that \\never happened in his classes was his entering the \\nroom through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, \\nmany people said he hadn’t noticed he was dead. He \\nhad simply got up to teach one day and left his body \\nbehind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom \\nfire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since. \\n\\nToday was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened \\nhis notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old \\nvacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was \\n\\nPage | 165 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough \\nto copy down a name or date, then falling asleep \\nagain. He had been speaking for half an hour when \\nsomething happened that had never happened before. \\nHermione put up her hand. \\n\\nProfessor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly \\ndull lecture on the International Warlock Convention \\nof 1289, looked amazed. \\n\\n“Miss — er — ?” \\n\\n“Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell \\nus anything about the Chamber of Secrets,” said \\nHermione in a clear voice. \\n\\nDean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth \\nhanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of \\nhis trance; Lavender Brown’s head came up off her \\narms and Neville Longbottom’s elbow slipped off his \\ndesk. \\n\\nProfessor Binns blinked. \\n\\n“My subject is History of Magic,” he said in his dry, \\nwheezy voice. “I deal with, facts, Miss Granger, not \\nmyths and legends.” He cleared his throat with a \\nsmall noise like chalk snapping and continued, “In \\nSeptember of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian \\nsorcerers — ” \\n\\nHe stuttered to a halt. Hermione’s hand was waving \\nin the air again. \\n\\n“Miss Grant?” \\n\\n“Please, sir, don’t legends always have a basis in \\nfact?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 166 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor Binns was looking at her in such \\namazement, Harry was sure no student had ever \\ninterrupted him before, alive or dead. \\n\\n“Well,” said Professor Binns slowly, “yes, one could \\nargue that, I suppose.” He peered at Hermione as \\nthough he had never seen a student properly before. \\n“However, the legend of which you speak is such a \\nvery sensational, even ludicrous tale — ” \\n\\nBut the whole class was now hanging on Professor \\nBinns ’s every word. He looked dimly at them all, every \\nface turned to his. Harry could tell he was completely \\nthrown by such an unusual show of interest. \\n\\n“Oh, very well,” he said slowly. “Let me see ... the \\nChamber of Secrets . . . \\n\\n“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded \\nover a thousand years ago — the precise date is \\nuncertain — by the four greatest witches and wizards \\nof the age. The four school Houses are named after \\nthem: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena \\nRavenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this \\ncastle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was \\nan age when magic was feared by common people, \\nand witches and wizards suffered much persecution.” \\n\\nHe paused, gazed blearily around the room, and \\ncontinued. \\n\\n“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony \\ntogether, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of \\nmagic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. \\nBut then disagreements sprang up between them. A \\nrift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. \\nSlytherin wished to be more selective about the \\nstudents admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that \\nmagical learning should be kept within all-magic \\nPage | 167 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfamilies. He disliked taking students of Muggle \\nparentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After \\na while, there was a serious argument on the subject \\nbetween Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left \\nthe school.” \\n\\nProfessor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, \\nlooking like a wrinkled old tortoise. \\n\\n“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he \\nsaid. “But these honest facts have been obscured by \\nthe fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The \\nstory goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber \\nin the castle, of which the other founders knew \\nnothing. \\n\\n“Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the \\nChamber of Secrets so that none would be able to \\nopen it until his own true heir arrived at the school. \\nThe heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber \\nof Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to \\npurge the school of all who were unworthy to study \\nmagic.” \\n\\nThere was silence as he finished telling the story, but \\nit wasn’t the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor \\nBinns ’s classes. There was unease in the air as \\neveryone continued to watch him, hoping for more. \\nProfessor Binns looked faintly annoyed. \\n\\n“The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,” he \\nsaid. “Naturally, the school has been searched for \\nevidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most \\nlearned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale \\ntold to frighten the gullible.” \\n\\nHermione’s hand was back in the air. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 168 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sir — what exactly do you mean by the ‘horror \\nwithin’ the Chamber?” \\n\\n“That is believed to be some sort of monster, which \\nthe Heir of Slytherin alone can control,” said Professor \\nBinns in his dry, reedy voice. \\n\\nThe class exchanged nervous looks. \\n\\n“I tell you, the thing does not exist,” said Professor \\nBinns, shuffling his notes. “There is no Chamber and \\nno monster.” \\n\\n“But, sir,” said Seamus Finnigan, “if the Chamber can \\nonly be opened by Slytherin’s true heir, no one else \\nwould be able to find it, would they?” \\n\\n“Nonsense, O’Flaherty,” said Professor Binns in an \\naggravated tone. “If a long succession of Hogwarts \\nheadmasters and headmistresses haven’t found the \\nthing — ” \\n\\n“But, Professor,” piped up Parvati Patil, “you’d \\nprobably have to use Dark Magic to open it — ” \\n\\n“Just because a wizard doesn’t use Dark Magic \\ndoesn’t mean he can’t, Miss Pennyfeather,” snapped \\nProfessor Binns. “I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore \\n\\n\\n\\n“But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so \\nDumbledore couldn’t — ” began Dean Thomas, but \\nProfessor Binns had had enough. \\n\\n“That will do,” he said sharply. “It is a myth! It does \\nnot exist! There is not a shred of evidence that \\nSlytherin ever built so much as a secret broom \\ncupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 169 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwill return, if you please, to history, to solid, \\nbelievable, verifiable facti” \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd within five minutes, the class had sunk back into \\nits usual torpor. \\n\\n“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old \\nloony,” Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought \\ntheir way through the teeming corridors at the end of \\nthe lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I \\nnever knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I \\nwouldn’t be in his House if you paid me. Honestly, if \\nthe Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve \\ngot the train straight back home. ...” \\n\\nHermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say \\nanything. His stomach had just dropped \\nunpleasantly. \\n\\nHarry had never told Ron and Hermione that the \\nSorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in \\nSlytherin. He could remember, as though it were \\nyesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear \\nwhen he’d placed the hat on his head a year before: \\nYou could be great, you know, it’s all here in your \\nhead, and Slytherin would help you on the way to \\ngreatness, no doubt about that. . . . \\n\\nBut Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin \\nHouse’s reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had \\nthought desperately, Not Slytherin ! and the hat had \\nsaid, Oh, well, if you’re sure ... better be Gryffindor. ... \\n\\nAs they were shunted along in the throng, Colin \\nCreevey went past. \\n\\n“Hiya, Harry!” \\n\\n“Hullo, Colin,” said Harry automatically. \\n\\nPage | 170 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying \\nyou’re — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nBut Colin was so small he couldn’t fight against the \\ntide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they \\nheard him squeak, “See you, Harry!” and he was \\ngone. \\n\\n“What’s a boy in his class saying about you?” \\nHermione wondered. \\n\\n“That I’m Slytherin’s heir, I expect,” said Harry, his \\nstomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly \\nremembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run \\naway from him at lunchtime. \\n\\n“People here’ll believe anything,” said Ron in disgust. \\n\\nThe crowd thinned and they were able to climb the \\nnext staircase without difficulty. \\n\\n“D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?” \\n\\nRon asked Hermione. \\n\\n“I don’t know,” she said, frowning. “Dumbledore \\ncouldn’t cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think \\nthat whatever attacked her might not be — well — \\nhuman.” \\n\\nAs she spoke, they turned a corner and found \\nthemselves at the end of the very corridor where the \\nattack had happened. They stopped and looked. The \\nscene was just as it had been that night, except that \\nthere was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, \\nand an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the \\nmessage “The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened.” \\n\\n“That’s where Filch has been keeping guard,” Ron \\nmuttered. \\n\\nPage | 171 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey looked at each other. The corridor was deserted. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Can’t hurt to have a poke around,” said Harry, \\ndropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees \\nso that he could crawl along, searching for clues. \\n\\n“Scorch marks!” he said. “Here — and here — ” \\n\\n“Come and look at this!” said Hermione. “This is \\nfunny. ...” \\n\\nHarry got up and crossed to the window next to the \\nmessage on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the \\ntopmost pane, where around twenty spiders were \\nscuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small \\ncrack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, \\nas though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get \\noutside. \\n\\n“Have you ever seen spiders act like that?” said \\nHermione wonderingly. \\n\\n“No,” said Harry, “have you, Ron? Ron?” \\n\\nHe looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well \\nback and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run. \\n\\n“What’s up?” said Harry. \\n\\n“I — don’t — like — spiders,” said Ron tensely. \\n\\n“I never knew that,” said Hermione, looking at Ron in \\nsurprise. “You’ve used spiders in Potions loads of \\ntimes. ...” \\n\\n“I don’t mind them dead,” said Ron, who was carefully \\nlooking anywhere but at the window. “I just don’t like \\nthe way they move. ...” \\n\\nPage | 172 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione giggled. \\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s not funny,” said Ron, fiercely. “If you must know, \\nwhen I was three, Fred turned my — my teddy bear \\ninto a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy \\nbroomstick. ... You wouldn’t like them either if you’d \\nbeen holding your bear and suddenly it had too many \\nlegs and ...” \\n\\nHe broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously \\nstill trying not to laugh. Feeling they had better get off \\nthe subject, Harry said, “Remember all that water on \\nthe floor? Where did that come from? Someone’s \\nmopped it up.” \\n\\n“It was about here,” said Ron, recovering himself to \\nwalk a few paces past Filch’s chair and pointing. \\n\\n“Level with this door.” \\n\\nHe reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly \\nwithdrew his hand as though he’d been burned. \\n\\n“What’s the matter?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Can’t go in there,” said Ron gruffly. “That’s a girls’ \\ntoilet.” \\n\\n“Oh, Ron, there won’t be anyone in there,” said \\nHermione, standing up and coming over. “That’s \\nMoaning Myrtle’s place. Come on, let’s have a look.” \\n\\nAnd ignoring the large OUT OF ORDER sign, she \\nopened the door. \\n\\nIt was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry \\nhad ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and \\nspotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. The floor \\nwas damp and reflected the dull light given off by the \\nstubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; \\nPage | 173 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and \\nscratched and one of them was dangling off its \\nhinges. \\n\\nHermione put her fingers to her lips and set off \\ntoward the end stall. When she reached it she said, \\n“Hello, Myrtle, how are you?” \\n\\nHarry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was \\nfloating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on \\nher chin. \\n\\n“This is a girls’ bathroom,” she said, eyeing Ron and \\nHarry suspiciously. “They’re not girls.” \\n\\n“No,” Hermione agreed. “I just wanted to show them \\nhow — er — nice it is in here.” \\n\\nShe waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the \\ndamp floor. \\n\\n“Ask her if she saw anything,” Harry mouthed at \\nHermione. \\n\\n“What are you whispering?” said Myrtle, staring at \\nhim. \\n\\n“Nothing,” said Harry quickly. “We wanted to ask — ” \\n\\n“I wish people would stop talking behind my back!” \\nsaid Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. “I do have \\nfeelings, you know, even if I am dead — ” \\n\\n“Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,” said Hermione. \\n“Harry only — ” \\n\\n“No one wants to upset me! That’s a good one!” \\nhowled Myrtle. “My life was nothing but misery at this \\nplace and now people come along ruining my death!” \\n\\nPage | 174 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We wanted to ask you if you’ve seen anything funny \\nlately,” said Hermione quickly. “Because a cat was \\nattacked right outside your front door on Halloween.” \\n\\n“Did you see anyone near here that night?” said \\nHarry. \\n\\n“I wasn’t paying attention,” said Myrtle dramatically. \\n“Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to \\nkill myself. Then, of course, I remembered that I’m — \\nthat I’m — ” \\n\\n“Already dead,” said Ron helpfully. \\n\\nMyrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned \\nover, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing \\nwater all over them and vanishing from sight, \\nalthough from the direction of her muffled sobs, she \\nhad come to rest somewhere in the U-bend. \\n\\nHarry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but \\nHermione shrugged wearily and said, “Honestly, that \\nwas almost cheerful for Myrtle. ... Come on, let’s go.” \\n\\nHarry had barely closed the door on Myrtle’s gurgling \\nsobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump. \\n\\n“RON!” \\n\\nPercy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the \\nstairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of \\ncomplete shock on his face. \\n\\n“That’s a girls’ bathroom!” he gasped. “What were you \\n— ?” \\n\\n“Just having a look around,” Ron shrugged. “Clues, \\nyou know — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 175 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPercy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry \\nforcefully of Mrs. Weasley. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Get — away — from — there — ” Percy said, striding \\ntoward them and starting to bustle them along, \\nflapping his arms. “Don’t you care what this looks \\nlike? Coming back here while everyone’s at dinner — ” \\n\\n“Why shouldn’t we be here?” said Ron hotly, stopping \\nshort and glaring at Percy. “Listen, we never laid a \\nfinger on that cat!” \\n\\n“That’s what I told Ginny,” said Percy fiercely, “but \\nshe still seems to think you’re going to be expelled, \\n\\nI’ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you \\nmight think of her, all the first years are thoroughly \\noverexcited by this business — ” \\n\\n“ You don’t care about Ginny,” said Ron, whose ears \\nwere now reddening. “You’re just worried I’m going to \\nmess up your chances of being Head Boy — ” \\n\\n“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, \\nfingering his prefect badge. “And I hope it teaches you \\na lesson! No more detective work, or I’ll write to \\nMum!” \\n\\nAnd he strode off, the back of his neck as red as \\nRon’s ears. \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as \\npossible from Percy in the common room that night. \\nRon was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting \\nhis Charms homework. When he reached absently for \\nhis wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the \\nparchment. Fuming almost as much as his \\nhomework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of \\nPage | 176 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry’s surprise, Hermione \\nfollowed suit. \\n\\n“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as \\nthough continuing a conversation they had just been \\nhaving. “Who’d want to frighten all the Squibs and \\nMuggle-borns out of Hogwarts?” \\n\\n“Let’s think,” said Ron in mock puzzlement. “Who do \\nwe know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?” \\n\\nHe looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, \\nunconvinced. \\n\\n“If you’re talking about Malfoy — ” \\n\\n“Of course I am!” said Ron. “You heard him — ‘You’ll \\nbe next, MudbloodsV — come on, you’ve only got to \\nlook at his foul rat face to know it’s him — ” \\n\\n“Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?” said Hermione \\nskeptically. \\n\\n“Look at his family,” said Harry, closing his books, \\ntoo. “The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; \\nhe’s always boasting about it. They could easily be \\nSlytherin’s descendants. His father’s definitely evil \\nenough.” \\n\\n“They could’ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets \\nfor centuries!” said Ron. “Handing it down, father to \\nson. ...” \\n\\n“Well,” said Hermione cautiously, “I suppose it’s \\npossible. ...” \\n\\n“But how do we prove it?” said Harry darkly. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 177 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“There might be a way,” said Hermione slowly, \\ndropping her voice still further with a quick glance \\nacross the room at Percy. “Of course, it would be \\ndifficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We’d be \\nbreaking about fifty school rules, I expect — ” \\n\\n“If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will \\nlet us know, won’t you?” said Ron irritably. \\n\\n“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to \\ndo is to get inside the Slytherin common room and \\nask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it’s \\nus.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed. \\n\\n“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be \\nsome Polyjuice Potion.” \\n\\n“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together. \\n\\n“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — ” \\n\\n“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions \\nthan listen to Snape?” muttered Ron. \\n\\n“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! \\nWe could change into three of the Slytherins. No one \\nwould know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us \\nanything. He’s probably boasting about it in the \\nSlytherin common room right now, if only we could \\nhear him.” \\n\\n“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said \\nRon, frowning. “What if we were stuck looking like \\nthree of the Slytherins forever?” \\n\\n“It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her \\nhand impatiently. “But getting hold of the recipe will \\n\\nPage | 178 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbe very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called \\nMoste Potente Potions and it’s bound to be in the \\nRestricted Section of the library.” \\n\\nThere was only one way to get out a book from the \\nRestricted Section: You needed a signed note of \\npermission from a teacher. \\n\\n“Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said \\nRon, “if we weren’t going to try and make one of the \\npotions.” \\n\\n“I think,” said Hermione, “that if we made it sound as \\nthough we were just interested in the theory, we \\nmight stand a chance. ...” \\n\\n“Oh, come on, no teacher’s going to fall for that,” said \\nRon. “They’d have to be really thick. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 179 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ROGUE BLUDGER \\n\\nSince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor \\nLockhart had not brought live creatures to class. \\nInstead, he read passages from his books to them, \\nand sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic \\nbits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these \\nreconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play \\na simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had \\ncured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, \\nand a vampire who had been unable to eat anything \\nexcept lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him. \\n\\nHarry was hauled to the front of the class during their \\nvery next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this \\ntime acting a werewolf. If he hadn’t had a very good \\nreason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would \\nhave refused to do it. \\n\\n“Nice loud howl, Harry — exactly — and then, if you’ll \\nbelieve it, I pounced — like this — slammed him to \\nthe floor — thus — with one hand, I managed to hold \\nhim down — with my other, I put my wand to his \\nthroat — I then screwed up my remaining strength \\nPage | 180 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets- J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nand performed the immensely complex Homorphus \\nCharm — he let out a piteous moan — go on, Harry — \\nhigher than that — good — the fur vanished — the \\nfangs shrank — and he turned back into a man. \\nSimple, yet effective — and another village will \\nremember me forever as the hero who delivered them \\nfrom the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.” \\n\\nThe bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet. \\n\\n“Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of \\nthe Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical \\nMe to the author of the best one!” \\n\\nThe class began to leave. Harry returned to the back \\nof the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting. \\n\\n“Ready?” Harry muttered. \\n\\n“Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously. \\n“All right ...” \\n\\nShe approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper \\nclutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right \\nbehind her. \\n\\n“Er — Professor Lockhart?” Hermione stammered. “I \\nwanted to — to get this book out of the library. Just \\nfor background reading.” She held out the piece of \\npaper, her hand shaking slightly. “But the thing is, \\nit’s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a \\nteacher to sign for it — I’m sure it would help me \\nunderstand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls \\nabout slow-acting venoms — ” \\n\\n“Ah, Gadding with GhoulsV’ said Lockhart, taking the \\nnote from Hermione and smiling widely at her. \\n“Possibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 181 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” said Hermione eagerly. “So clever, the way \\nyou trapped that last one with the tea-strainer — ” \\n\\n“Well, I’m sure no one will mind me giving the best \\nstudent of the year a little extra help,” said Lockhart \\nwarmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock \\nquill. “Yes, nice, isn’t it?” he said, misreading the \\nrevolted look on Ron’s face. “I usually save it for book \\nsignings.” \\n\\nHe scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note \\nand handed it back to Hermione. \\n\\n“So, Harry,” said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the \\nnote with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. \\n“Tomorrow’s the first Quidditch match of the season, I \\nbelieve? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear \\nyou’re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was \\nasked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to \\ndedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces. \\nStill, if ever you feel the need for a little private \\ntraining, don’t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass \\non my expertise to less able players. ...” \\n\\nHarry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then \\nhurried off after Ron and Hermione. \\n\\n“I don’t believe it,” he said as the three of them \\nexamined the signature on the note. “He didn’t even \\nlook at the book we wanted.” \\n\\n“That’s because he’s a brainless git,” said Ron. “But \\nwho cares, we’ve got what we needed — ” \\n\\n“He is not a brainless git,” said Hermione shrilly as \\nthey half ran toward the library. \\n\\n“Just because he said you were the best student of \\nthe year — ” \\n\\nPage | 182 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey dropped their voices as they entered the muffled \\nstillness of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian, \\nwas a thin, irritable woman who looked like an \\nunderfed vulture. \\n\\n“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously, \\ntrying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione \\nwouldn’t let go. \\n\\n“I was wondering if I could keep it,” she said \\nbreathlessly. \\n\\n“Oh, come on,” said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp \\nand thrusting it at Madam Pince. “We’ll get you \\nanother autograph. Lockhart ’ll sign anything if it \\nstands still long enough.” \\n\\nMadam Pince held the note up to the light, as though \\ndetermined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test. \\nShe stalked away between the lofty shelves and \\nreturned several minutes later carrying a large and \\nmoldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into \\nher bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or \\nlook too guilty. \\n\\nFive minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning \\nMyrtle’s out-of-order bathroom once again. Hermione \\nhad overridden Ron’s objections by pointing out that \\nit was the last place anyone in their right minds \\nwould go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. \\nMoaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but \\nthey were ignoring her, and she them. \\n\\nHermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and \\nthe three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages. \\n\\nIt was clear from a glance why it belonged in the \\nRestricted Section. Some of the potions had effects \\nalmost too gruesome to think about, and there were \\nsome very unpleasant illustrations, which included a \\nPage | 183 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nman who seemed to have been turned inside out and \\na witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of \\nher head. \\n\\n“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the \\npage headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated \\nwith drawings of people halfway through transforming \\ninto other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist \\nhad imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces. \\n\\n“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” \\nsaid Hermione as they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing \\nflies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,” she \\nmurmured, running her finger down the list of \\ningredients. “Well, they’re easy enough, they’re in the \\nstudent store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. ... \\nOooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know \\nwhere we’re going to get that — shredded skin of a \\nboomslang — thatll be tricky, too — and of course a \\nbit of whoever we want to change into.” \\n\\n“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a \\nbit of whoever we’re changing into? I’m drinking \\nnothing with Crabbe’s toenails in it — ” \\n\\nHermione continued as though she hadn’t heard him. \\n\\n“We don’t have to worry about that yet, though, \\nbecause we add those bits last. ...” \\n\\nRon turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another \\nworry. \\n\\n“D’you realize how much we’re going to have to steal, \\nHermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that’s \\ndefinitely not in the students’ cupboard. What’re we \\ngoing to do, break into Snape’s private stores? I don’t \\nknow if this is a good idea. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 184 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione shut the book with a snap. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,” she \\nsaid. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks \\nand her eyes were brighter than usual. “ I don’t want \\nto break rules, you know. / think threatening Muggle- \\nborns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. \\nBut if you don’t want to find out if it’s Malfoy, I’ll go \\nstraight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back \\nin — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“I never thought I’d see the day when you’d be \\npersuading us to break rules,” said Ron. “All right, \\nwe’ll do it. But not toenails, okay?” \\n\\n“How long will it take to make, anyway?” said Harry \\nas Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again. \\n\\n“Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the \\nfull moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for \\ntwenty-one days ... I’d say it’d be ready in about a \\nmonth, if we can get all the ingredients.” \\n\\n“A month?” said Ron. “Malfoy could have attacked \\nhalf the Muggle-borns in the school by then!” But \\nHermione ’s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he \\nadded swiftly, “But it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full \\nsteam ahead, I say.” \\n\\nHowever, while Hermione was checking that the coast \\nwas clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron \\nmuttered to Harry, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can \\njust knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.” \\n\\nHarry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a \\nwhile thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He \\nwas nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood \\nwould say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of \\nfacing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms \\nPage | 185 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngold could buy. He had never wanted to beat \\nSlytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there \\nwith his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and \\nwent down to breakfast early, where he found the rest \\nof the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty \\ntable, all looking uptight and not speaking much. \\n\\nAs eleven o’clock approached, the whole school \\nstarted to make its way down to the Quidditch \\nstadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of \\nthunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying \\nover to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker \\nrooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor \\nrobes, then sat down to listen to Wood’s usual pre- \\nmatch pep talk. \\n\\n“Slytherin has better brooms than us,” he began. “No \\npoint denying it. But we’ve got better people on our \\nbrooms. We’ve trained harder than they have, we’ve \\nbeen flying in all weathers — ” (“Too true,” muttered \\nGeorge Weasley. “I haven’t been properly dry since \\nAugust”) “ — and we’re going to make them rue the \\nday they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his \\nway onto their team.” \\n\\nChest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry. \\n\\n“It’ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a \\nSeeker has to have something more than a rich \\nfather. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, \\nHarry, because we’ve got to win today, we’ve got to.” \\n\\n“So no pressure, Harry,” said Fred, winking at him. \\n\\nAs they walked out onto the field, a roar of noise \\ngreeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and \\nHufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but \\nthe Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and \\nhisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch \\nPage | 186 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nteacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which \\nthey did, giving each other threatening stares and \\ngripping rather harder than was necessary. \\n\\n“On my whistle,” said Madam Hooch. “Three ... two ... \\none ...” \\n\\nWith a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, \\nthe fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. \\n\\nHarry flew higher than any of them, squinting around \\nfor the Snitch. \\n\\n“All right there, Scarhead?” yelled Malfoy, shooting \\nunderneath him as though to show off the speed of \\nhis broom. \\n\\nHarry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a \\nheavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he \\navoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as \\nit passed. \\n\\n“Close one, Harry!” said George, streaking past him \\nwith his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger \\nback toward a Slytherin. Harry saw George give the \\nBludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian \\nPucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair \\nand shot straight for Harry again. \\n\\nHarry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George \\nmanaged to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, the \\nBludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry’s \\nhead. \\n\\nHarry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the \\nother end of the field. He could hear the Bludger \\nwhistling along behind him. What was going on? \\nBludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it \\nwas their job to try and unseat as many people as \\npossible. ... \\n\\nPage | 187 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other \\nend. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with \\nall his might; the Bludger was knocked off course. \\n\\n“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as \\nthough it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the \\nBludger pelted after him once more and Harry was \\nforced to fly off at full speed. \\n\\nIt had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto \\nhis face, splattering onto his glasses. He didn’t have a \\nclue what was going on in the rest of the game until \\nhe heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, \\n“Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero — ” \\n\\nThe Slytherins’ superior brooms were clearly doing \\ntheir jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing \\nall it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and \\nGeorge were now flying so close to him on either side \\nthat Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing \\narms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let \\nalone catch it. \\n\\n“Someone’s — tampered — with — this — Bludger — ” \\nFred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it \\nas it launched a new attack on Harry. \\n\\n“We need time out,” said George, trying to signal to \\nWood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry’s nose at \\nthe same time. \\n\\nWood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch’s \\nwhistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived \\nfor the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger. \\n\\n“What’s going on?” said Wood as the Gryffindor team \\nhuddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd \\njeered. “We’re being flattened. Fred, George, where \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 188 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwere you when that Bludger stopped Angelina \\nscoring?” \\n\\n“We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other \\nBludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,” said George \\nangrily. “Someone’s fixed it — it won’t leave Harry \\nalone. It hasn’t gone for anyone else all game. The \\nSlytherins must have done something to it.” \\n\\n“But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam \\nHooch’s office since our last practice, and there was \\nnothing wrong with them then. ...” said Wood, \\nanxiously. \\n\\nMadam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her \\nshoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering \\nand pointing in his direction. \\n\\n“Listen,” said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, \\n“with you two flying around me all the time the only \\nway I’m going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my \\nsleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal \\nwith the rogue one.” \\n\\n“Don’t be thick,” said Fred. “It’ll take your head off.” \\n\\nWood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys. \\n\\n“Oliver, this is insane,” said Alicia Spinnet angrily. \\n“You can’t let Harry deal with that thing on his own. \\nLet’s ask for an inquiry — ” \\n\\n“If we stop now, we’ll have to forfeit the match!” said \\nHarry. “And we’re not losing to Slytherin just because \\nof a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave \\nme alone!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 189 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is all your fault,” George said angrily to Wood. “ \\n‘Get the Snitch or die trying,’ what a stupid thing to \\ntell him—” \\n\\n\\n\\nMadam Hooch had joined them. \\n\\n“Ready to resume play?” she asked Wood. \\n\\nWood looked at the determined look on Harry’s face. \\n\\n“All right,” he said. “Fred, George, you heard Harry — \\nleave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on \\nhis own.” \\n\\nThe rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam \\nHooch’s whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and \\nheard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him. \\nHigher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and \\nswooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly \\ndizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain \\nwas speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as \\nhe hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive \\nfrom the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the \\ncrowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the \\nrogue Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change \\ndirection as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind \\nof roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, \\nsquinting through the silver sheets of rain to the \\nGryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying \\nto get past Wood — \\n\\nA whistling in Harry’s ear told him the Bludger had \\njust missed him again; he turned right over and sped \\nin the opposite direction. \\n\\n“Training for the ballet, Potter?” yelled Malfoy as \\nHarry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair \\nto dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing \\na few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at \\n\\nPage | 190 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMalfoy in hatred, he saw it — the Golden Snitch. It \\nwas hovering inches above Malfoy’s left ear — and \\nMalfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn’t seen it. \\n\\nFor an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not \\ndaring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up \\nand saw the Snitch. \\n\\nWHAM. \\n\\nHe had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger \\nhad hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and \\nHarry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the searing \\npain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain- \\ndrenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his \\nright arm dangling useless at his side — the Bludger \\ncame pelting back for a second attack, this time \\naiming at his face — Harry swerved out of the way, \\none idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to \\nMalfoy. \\n\\nThrough a haze of rain and pain he dived for the \\nshimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes \\nwiden with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking \\nhim. \\n\\n“What the — ” he gasped, careening out of Harry’s \\nway. \\n\\nHarry took his remaining hand off his broom and \\nmade a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the \\ncold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with \\nhis legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as \\nhe headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to \\npass out. \\n\\nWith a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off \\nhis broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange \\nangle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a \\n\\nPage | 191 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndistance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He \\nfocused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand. \\n\\n“Aha,” he said vaguely. “We’ve won.” \\n\\nAnd he fainted. \\n\\nHe came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on \\nthe field, with someone leaning over him. He saw a \\nglitter of teeth. \\n\\n“Oh, no, not you,” he moaned. \\n\\n“Doesn’t know what he’s saying,” said Lockhart loudly \\nto the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around \\nthem. “Not to worry, Harry. I’m about to fix your \\narm.” \\n\\n“iVo!” said Harry. “I’ll keep it like this, thanks. ...” \\n\\nHe tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard \\na familiar clicking noise nearby. \\n\\n“I don’t want a photo of this, Colin,” he said loudly. \\n\\n“Lie back, Harry,” said Lockhart soothingly. “It’s a \\nsimple charm I’ve used countless times — ” \\n\\n“Why can’t I just go to the hospital wing?” said Harry \\nthrough clenched teeth. \\n\\n“He should really, Professor,” said a muddy Wood, \\nwho couldn’t help grinning even though his Seeker \\nwas injured. “Great capture, Harry, really \\nspectacular, your best yet, I’d say — ” \\n\\nThrough the thicket of legs around him, Harry \\nspotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 192 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific \\nfight. \\n\\n“Stand back,” said Lockhart, who was rolling up his \\njade-green sleeves. \\n\\n“No — don’t — ” said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was \\ntwirling his wand and a second later had directed it \\nstraight at Harry’s arm. \\n\\nA strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry’s \\nshoulder and spread all the way down to his \\nfingertips. It felt as though his arm was being \\ndeflated. He didn’t dare look at what was happening. \\nHe had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his \\narm, but his worst fears were realized as the people \\nabove him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking \\naway madly. His arm didn’t hurt anymore — nor did \\nit feel remotely like an arm. \\n\\n“Ah,” said Lockhart. “Yes. Well, that can sometimes \\nhappen. But the point is, the bones are no longer \\nbroken. That’s the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, \\njust toddle up to the hospital wing — ah, Mr. \\n\\nWeasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? — and \\nMadam Pomfrey will be able to — er — tidy you up a \\nbit.” \\n\\nAs Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. \\nTaking a deep breath he looked down at his right \\nside. What he saw nearly made him pass out again. \\n\\nPoking out of the end of his robes was what looked \\nlike a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove. He tried to \\nmove his fingers. Nothing happened. \\n\\nLockhart hadn’t mended Harry’s bones. He had \\nremoved them. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 193 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMadam Pomfrey wasn’t at all pleased. \\n\\n“You should have come straight to me!” she raged, \\nholding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an \\nhour before, had been a working arm. “I can mend \\nbones in a second — but growing them back — ” \\n\\n“You will be able to, won’t you?” said Harry \\ndesperately. \\n\\n“I’ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,” said \\nMadam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of \\npajamas. “You’ll have to stay the night. ...” \\n\\nHermione waited outside the curtain drawn around \\nHarry’s bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. It \\ntook a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a \\nsleeve. \\n\\n“How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, \\neh?” Ron called through the curtain as he pulled \\nHarry’s limp fingers through the cuff. “If Harry had \\nwanted deboning he would have asked.” \\n\\n“Anyone can make a mistake,” said Hermione. “And it \\ndoesn’t hurt anymore, does it, Harry?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry, getting into bed. “But it doesn’t do \\nanything else either.” \\n\\nAs he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped \\npointlessly. \\n\\nHermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the \\ncurtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of \\nsomething labeled Skele-Gro. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 194 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re in for a rough night,” she said, pouring out a \\nsteaming beakerful and handing it to him. “Regrowing \\nbones is a nasty business.” \\n\\nSo was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry’s mouth \\nand throat as it went down, making him cough and \\nsplutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and \\ninept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron \\nand Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water. \\n\\n“We won, though,” said Ron, a grin breaking across \\nhis face. “That was some catch you made. Malfoy’s \\nface ... he looked ready to kill. ...” \\n\\n“I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,” said \\nHermione darkly. \\n\\n“We can add that to the list of questions we’ll ask him \\nwhen we’ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,” said Harry, \\nsinking back onto his pillows. “I hope it tastes better \\nthan this stuff. ...” \\n\\n“If it’s got bits of Slytherins in it? You’ve got to be \\njoking,” said Ron. \\n\\nThe door of the hospital wing burst open at that \\nmoment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the \\nGryffindor team had arrived to see Harry. \\n\\n“Unbelievable flying, Harry,” said George. “I’ve just \\nseen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about \\nhaving the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. \\nMalfoy didn’t seem too happy.” \\n\\nThey had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of \\npumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry’s bed and \\nwere just getting started on what promised to be a \\ngood party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over, \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 195 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshouting, “This boy needs rest, he’s got thirty- three \\nbones to regrow! Out! OUT!” \\n\\nAnd Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him \\nfrom the stabbing pains in his limp arm. \\n\\nHours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in \\nthe pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His \\narm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, he \\nthought that was what had woken him. Then, with a \\nthrill of horror, he realized that someone was \\nsponging his forehead in the dark. \\n\\n“Get off!” he said loudly, and then, “Dobby\\\\” \\n\\nThe house-elf’s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering \\nat Harry through the darkness. A single tear was \\nrunning down his long, pointed nose. \\n\\n“Harry Potter came back to school,” he whispered \\nmiserably. “Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. \\nAh sir, why didn’t you heed Dobby? Why didn’t Harry \\nPotter go back home when he missed the train?” \\n\\nHarry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed \\nDobby’s sponge away. \\n\\n“What’re you doing here?” he said. “And how did you \\nknow I missed the train?” \\n\\nDobby’s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a \\nsudden suspicion. \\n\\n“It was you!” he said slowly. “You stopped the barrier \\nfrom letting us through!” \\n\\n“Indeed yes, sir,” said Dobby, nodding his head \\nvigorously, ears flapping. “Dobby hid and watched for \\nHarry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had \\n\\nPage | 196 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto iron his hands afterward” — he showed Harry ten \\nlong, bandaged fingers — “but Dobby didn’t care, sir, \\nfor he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did \\nDobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school \\nanother way!” \\n\\nHe was rocking backward and forward, shaking his \\nugly head. \\n\\n“Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter \\nwas back at Hogwarts, he let his master’s dinner \\nburn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir. ...” \\n\\nHarry slumped back onto his pillows. \\n\\n“You nearly got Ron and me expelled,” he said \\nfiercely. “You’d better get lost before my bones come \\nback, Dobby, or I might strangle you.” \\n\\nDobby smiled weakly. \\n\\n“Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them \\nfive times a day at home.” \\n\\nHe blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase \\nhe wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger \\nebb away in spite of himself. \\n\\n“Why d’you wear that thing, Dobby?” he asked \\ncuriously. \\n\\n“This, sir?” said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. “ \\nTis a mark of the house-elf’s enslavement, sir. Dobby \\ncan only be freed if his masters present him with \\nclothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby \\neven a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave \\ntheir house forever.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 197 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, \\n“Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his \\nBludger would be enough to make — ” \\n\\n“Your Bludger?” said Harry, anger rising once more. \\n“What d’you mean, your Bludger? You made that \\nBludger try and kill me?” \\n\\n“Not kill you, sir, never kill you!” said Dobby, \\nshocked. “Dobby wants to save Harry Potter’s life! \\nBetter sent home, grievously injured, than remain \\nhere, sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt \\nenough to be sent home!” \\n\\n“Oh, is that all?” said Harry angrily. “I don’t suppose \\nyou’re going to tell me why you wanted me sent home \\nin pieces?” \\n\\n“Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!” Dobby groaned, more \\ntears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase. “If he knew \\nwhat he means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we \\ndregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it \\nwas when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the \\nheight of his powers, sir! We house-elves were treated \\nlike vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like \\nthat, sir,” he admitted, drying his face on the \\npillowcase. “But mostly, sir, life has improved for my \\nkind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be- \\nNamed. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord’s \\npower was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and \\nHarry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of \\nus who thought the Dark days would never end, sir. \\n\\n... And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to \\nhappen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby \\ncannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is \\nto repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is \\nopen once more — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 198 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDobby froze, horrors truck, then grabbed Harry’s \\nwater jug from his bedside table and cracked it over \\nhis own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, he \\ncrawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, \\n“Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby ...” \\n\\n“So there is a Chamber of Secrets?” Harry whispered. \\n“And — did you say it’s been opened before ? Tell me, \\nDobby!” \\n\\nHe seized the elf’s bony wrist as Dobby’s hand inched \\ntoward the water jug. “But I’m not Muggle-born — \\nhow can I be in danger from the Chamber?” \\n\\n“Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,” \\nstammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. “Dark \\ndeeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter \\nmust not be here when they happen — go home, \\n\\nHarry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle \\nin this, sir, ’tis too dangerous — ” \\n\\n“Who is it, Dobby?” Harry said, keeping a firm hold on \\nDobby’s wrist to stop him from hitting himself with \\nthe water jug again. “Who’s opened it? Who opened it \\nlast time?” \\n\\n“Dobby can’t, sir, Dobby can’t, Dobby mustn’t tell!” \\nsquealed the elf. “Go home, Harry Potter, go home!” \\n\\n“I’m not going anywhere!” said Harry fiercely. “One of \\nmy best friends is Muggle-born; she’ll be first in line if \\nthe Chamber really has been opened — ” \\n\\n“Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!” \\nmoaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy. “So \\nnoble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must, \\nHarry Potter must not — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 199 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry \\nheard it, too. There were footsteps coming down the \\npassageway outside. \\n\\n“Dobby must go!” breathed the elf, terrified. There \\nwas a loud crack, and Harry’s fist was suddenly \\nclenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his \\neyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the \\nfootsteps drew nearer. \\n\\nNext moment, Dumbledore was backing into the \\ndormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a \\nnightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like \\na statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second \\nlater, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a \\nbed. \\n\\n“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Dumbledore, and \\nProfessor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry’s \\nbed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be \\nasleep. He heard urgent voices, and then Professor \\nMcGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by \\nMadam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over \\nher nightdress. He heard a sharp intake of breath. \\n\\n“What happened?” Madam Pomfrey whispered to \\nDumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed. \\n\\n“Another attack,” said Dumbledore. “Minerva found \\nhim on the stairs.” \\n\\n“There was a bunch of grapes next to him,” said \\nProfessor McGonagall. “We think he was trying to \\nsneak up here to visit Potter.” \\n\\nHarry’s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and \\ncarefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could \\nlook at the statue on the bed. A ray of moonlight lay \\nacross its staring face. \\n\\nPage | 200 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his \\nhands were stuck up in front of him, holding his \\ncamera. \\n\\n“Petrified?” whispered Madam Pomfrey. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “But I shudder to \\nthink ... If Albus hadn’t been on the way downstairs \\nfor hot chocolate — who knows what might have — ” \\n\\nThe three of them stared down at Colin. Then \\nDumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the \\ncamera out of Colin’s rigid grip. \\n\\n“You don’t think he managed to get a picture of his \\nattacker?” said Professor McGonagall eagerly. \\n\\nDumbledore didn’t answer. He opened the back of the \\ncamera. \\n\\n“Good gracious!” said Madam Pomfrey. \\n\\nA jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, \\nthree beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt \\nplastic. \\n\\n“Melted,” said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. “All \\nmelted ...” \\n\\n“What does this mean, Albus?” Professor McGonagall \\nasked urgently. \\n\\n“It means,” said Dumbledore, “that the Chamber of \\nSecrets is indeed open again.” \\n\\nMadam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. \\nProfessor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore. \\n\\n“But, Albus ... surely ... who?” \\n\\nPage | 201 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The question is not who,” said Dumbledore, his eyes \\non Colin. “The question is, how. ...” \\n\\nAnd from what Harry could see of Professor \\nMcGonagall’s shadowy face, she didn’t understand \\nthis any better than he did. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 202 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE DUELING CLUB \\n\\nHarry woke up on Sunday morning to find the \\ndormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm \\nreboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked \\nover at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from view \\nby the high curtains Harry had changed behind \\nyesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey \\ncame bustling over with a breakfast tray and then \\nbegan bending and stretching his arm and fingers. \\n\\n“All in order,” she said as he clumsily fed himself \\nporridge left-handed. “When you’ve finished eating, \\nyou may leave.” \\n\\nHarry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off \\nto Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and \\nHermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren’t \\nthere. Harry left to look for them, wondering where \\nthey could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that \\nthey weren’t interested in whether he had his bones \\nback or not. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 203 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nAs Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled \\nout of it, looking in far better spirits than last time \\nthey’d met. \\n\\n“Oh, hello, Harry,” he said. “Excellent flying \\nyesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken \\nthe lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points!” \\n\\n“You haven’t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?” said \\nHarry. \\n\\n“No, I haven’t,” said Percy, his smile fading. “I hope \\nRon’s not in another girls’ toilet ...” \\n\\nHarry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, \\nand then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle’s \\nbathroom. He couldn’t see why Ron and Hermione \\nwould be in there again, but after making sure that \\nneither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened \\nthe door and heard their voices coming from a locked \\nstall. \\n\\n“It’s me,” he said, closing the door behind him. There \\nwas a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the \\nstall and he saw Hermione ’s eye peering through the \\nkeyhole. \\n\\n“Harry\\\\” she said. “You gave us such a fright — come \\nin — how’s your arm?” \\n\\n“Fine,” said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old \\ncauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling \\nfrom under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire \\nbeneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires \\nwas a speciality of Hermione ’s. \\n\\n“We ’d’ve come to meet you, but we decided to get \\nstarted on the Polyjuice Potion,” Ron explained as \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 204 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. “We’ve \\ndecided this is the safest place to hide it.” \\n\\nHarry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione \\ninterrupted. \\n\\n“We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall \\ntelling Professor Flitwick this morning. That’s why we \\ndecided we’d better get going — ” \\n\\n“The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the \\nbetter,” snarled Ron. “D’you know what I think? He \\nwas in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, \\nhe took it out on Colin.” \\n\\n“There’s something else,” said Harry, watching \\nHermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing \\nthem into the potion. “Dobby came to visit me in the \\nmiddle of the night.” \\n\\nRon and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told \\nthem everything Dobby had told him — or hadn’t told \\nhim. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths \\nopen. \\n\\n“The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?” \\nHermione said. \\n\\n“This settles it,” said Ron in a triumphant voice. \\n“Lucius Malfoy must’ve opened the Chamber when he \\nwas at school here and now he’s told dear old Draco \\nhow to do it. It’s obvious. Wish Dobby ’d told you what \\nkind of monster’s in there, though. I want to know \\nhow come nobody’s noticed it sneaking around the \\nschool.” \\n\\n“Maybe it can make itself invisible,” said Hermione, \\nprodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. “Or \\nmaybe it can disguise itself — pretend to be a suit of \\n\\nPage | 205 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\narmor or something — I’ve read about Chameleon \\nGhouls — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“You read too much, Hermione,” said Ron, pouring \\ndead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up \\nthe empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry. \\n\\n“So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and \\nbroke your arm. ...” He shook his head. “You know \\nwhat, Harry? If he doesn’t stop trying to save your life \\nhe’s going to kill you.” \\n\\n\\n\\nk k k \\n\\n\\n\\nThe news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and \\nwas now lying as though dead in the hospital wing \\nhad spread through the entire school by Monday \\nmorning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and \\nsuspicion. The first years were now moving around \\nthe castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they \\nwould be attacked if they ventured forth alone. \\n\\nGinny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in \\nCharms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and \\nGeorge were going the wrong way about cheering her \\nup. They were taking turns covering themselves with \\nfur or boils and jumping out at her from behind \\nstatues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic \\nwith rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. \\nWeasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares. \\n\\nMeanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade \\nin talismans, amulets, and other protective devices \\nwas sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought \\na large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple \\ncrystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other \\nGryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 206 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be \\nattacked. \\n\\n“They went for Filch first,” Neville said, his round face \\nfearful. “And everyone knows I’m almost a Squib.” \\n\\nIn the second week of December Professor \\nMcGonagall came around as usual, collecting names \\nof those who would be staying at school for \\nChristmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; \\nthey had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck \\nthem as very suspicious. The holidays would be the \\nperfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to \\nworm a confession out of him. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They \\nstill needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, \\nand the only place they were going to get them was \\nfrom Snape’s private stores. Harry privately felt he’d \\nrather face Slytherin’s legendary monster than let \\nSnape catch him robbing his office. \\n\\n“What we need,” said Hermione briskly as Thursday \\nafternoon’s double Potions lesson loomed nearer, “is a \\ndiversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape’s \\noffice and take what we need.” \\n\\nHarry and Ron looked at her nervously. \\n\\n“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione \\ncontinued in a matter-of-fact tone. “You two will be \\nexpelled if you get into any more trouble, and I’ve got \\na clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough \\nmayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.” \\n\\nHarry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in \\nSnape’s Potions class was about as safe as poking a \\nsleeping dragon in the eye. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 207 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPotions lessons took place in one of the large \\ndungeons. Thursday afternoon’s lesson proceeded in \\nthe usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming \\nbetween the wooden desks, on which stood brass \\nscales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through \\nthe fumes, making waspish remarks about the \\nGryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered \\nappreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape’s \\nfavorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron \\nand Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they \\nwould get detention faster than you could say \\n“Unfair.” \\n\\nHarry’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he \\nhad his mind on more important things. He was \\nwaiting for Hermione’s signal, and he hardly listened \\nas Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion. When \\nSnape turned and walked off to bully Neville, \\nHermione caught Harry’s eye and nodded. \\n\\nHarry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, \\npulled one of Fred’s Filibuster fireworks out of his \\npocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The \\nfirework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had \\nonly seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and \\nlobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in \\nGoyle’s cauldron. \\n\\nGoyle’s potion exploded, showering the whole class. \\nPeople shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution \\nhit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to \\nswell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his \\nhands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size \\nof a dinner plate — Snape was trying to restore calm \\nand find out what had happened. Through the \\nconfusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into \\nSnape’s office. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 208 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Silence! SILENCE!” Snape roared. “Anyone who has \\nbeen splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught — \\nwhen I find out who did this — ” \\n\\nHarry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry \\nforward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose \\nlike a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to \\nSnape ’s desk, some weighted down with arms like \\nclubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed- \\nup lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the \\ndungeon, the front of her robes bulging. \\n\\nWhen everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the \\nvarious swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to \\nGoyle’s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black \\nremains of the firework. There was a sudden hush. \\n\\n“If I ever find out who threw this,” Snape whispered, “I \\nshall make sure that person is expelled.” \\n\\nHarry arranged his face into what he hoped was a \\npuzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, \\nand the bell that rang ten minutes later could not \\nhave been more welcome. \\n\\n“He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as \\nthey hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. “I \\ncould tell.” \\n\\nHermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron \\nand began to stir feverishly. \\n\\n“It’ll be ready in two weeks,” she said happily. \\n\\n“Snape can’t prove it was you,” said Ron reassuringly \\nto Harry. “What can he do?” \\n\\n“Knowing Snape, something foul,” said Harry as the \\npotion frothed and bubbled. \\n\\nPage | 209 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking \\nacross the entrance hall when they saw a small knot \\nof people gathered around the notice board, reading a \\npiece of parchment that had just been pinned up. \\nSeamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them \\nover, looking excited. \\n\\n“They’re starting a Dueling Club!” said Seamus. “First \\nmeeting tonight! I wouldn’t mind dueling lessons; \\nthey might come in handy one of these days. ...” \\n\\n“What, you reckon Slytherin’s monster can duel?” \\nsaid Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest. \\n\\n“Could be useful,” he said to Harry and Hermione as \\nthey went into dinner. “Shall we go?” \\n\\nHarry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o’clock \\nthat evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The \\nlong dining tables had vanished and a golden stage \\nhad appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of \\ncandles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety \\nblack once more and most of the school seemed to be \\npacked beneath it, all carrying their wands and \\nlooking excited. \\n\\n“I wonder who’ll be teaching us?” said Hermione as \\nthey edged into the chattering crowd. “Someone told \\nme Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was \\nyoung — maybe it’ll be him.” \\n\\n“As long as it’s not — ” Harry began, but he ended on \\na groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the \\nstage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and \\naccompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his \\nusual black. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 210 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLockhart waved an arm for silence and called, \\n\\n“Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? \\nCan you all hear me? Excellent! \\n\\n“Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me \\npermission to start this little dueling club, to train \\nyou all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I \\nmyself have done on countless occasions — for full \\ndetails, see my published works. \\n\\n“Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,” \\nsaid Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. “He tells me he \\nknows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has \\nsportingly agreed to help me with a short \\ndemonstration before we begin. Now, I don’t want any \\nof you youngsters to worry — you’ll still have your \\nPotions master when I’m through with him, never \\nfear!” \\n\\n“Wouldn’t it be good if they finished each other off?” \\nRon muttered in Harry’s ear. \\n\\nSnape ’s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why \\nLockhart was still smiling; if Snape had been looking \\nat him like that he’d have been running as fast as he \\ncould in the opposite direction. \\n\\nLockhart and Snape turned to face each other and \\nbowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of \\nhis hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably. \\nThen they raised their wands like swords in front of \\nthem. \\n\\n“As you see, we are holding our wands in the \\naccepted combative position,” Lockhart told the silent \\ncrowd. “On the count of three, we will cast our first \\nspells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 211 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wouldn’t bet on that,” Harry murmured, watching \\nSnape baring his teeth. \\n\\n“One — two — three — ” \\n\\nBoth of them swung their wands above their heads \\nand pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: \\n\\n“ ExpelliarmusV’ There was a dazzling flash of scarlet \\nlight and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew \\nbackward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and \\nslid down it to sprawl on the floor. \\n\\nMalfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. \\nHermione was dancing on tiptoes. “Do you think he’s \\nall right?” she squealed through her fingers. \\n\\n“Who cares?” said Harry and Ron together. \\n\\nLockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat \\nhad fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end. \\n\\n“Well, there you have it!” he said, tottering back onto \\nthe platform. “That was a Disarming Charm — as you \\nsee, I’ve lost my wand — ah, thank you, Miss Brown \\n— yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor \\nSnape, but if you don’t mind my saying so, it was very \\nobvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to \\nstop you it would have been only too easy — however, \\n\\nI felt it would be instructive to let them see ...” \\n\\nSnape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had \\nnoticed, because he said, “Enough demonstrating! I’m \\ngoing to come amongst you now and put you all into \\npairs. Professor Snape, if you’d like to help me — ” \\n\\nThey moved through the crowd, matching up \\npartners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch- \\nFletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 212 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Time to split up the dream team, I think,” he \\nsneered. “Weasley, you can partner Finnigan. Potter \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry moved automatically toward Hermione. \\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said Snape, smiling coldly. “Mr. \\nMalfoy, come over here. Let’s see what you make of \\nthe famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger — you can \\npartner Miss Bulstrode.” \\n\\nMalfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a \\nSlytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he’d \\nseen in Holidays with Hags. She was large and square \\nand her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave \\nher a weak smile that she did not return. \\n\\n“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the \\nplatform. “And bow!” \\n\\nHarry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not \\ntaking their eyes off each other. \\n\\n“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I \\ncount to three, cast your charms to disarm your \\nopponents — only to disarm them — we don’t want \\nany accidents — one . . . two . . . three — ” \\n\\nHarry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already \\nstarted on “two”: His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as \\nthough he’d been hit over the head with a saucepan. \\nHe stumbled, but everything still seemed to be \\nworking, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his \\nwand straight at Malfoy and shouted, “Rictusempral” \\n\\nA jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he \\ndoubled up, wheezing. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 213 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I said disarm only\\\\” Lockhart shouted in alarm over \\nthe heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his \\nknees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and \\nhe could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back, \\nwith a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch \\nMalfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a \\nmistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand \\nat Harry’s knees, choked, “Tarantallegral” and the \\nnext second Harry’s legs began to jerk around out of \\nhis control in a kind of quickstep. \\n\\n“Stop! Stop!” screamed Lockhart, but Snape took \\ncharge. \\n\\n“Finite Incantatem\\\\” he shouted; Harry’s feet stopped \\ndancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able \\nto look up. \\n\\nA haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the \\nscene. Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, \\npanting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, \\napologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; \\nbut Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still \\nmoving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and \\nHermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands \\nlay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt forward and \\npulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot \\nbigger than he was. \\n\\n“Dear, dear,” said Lockhart, skittering through the \\ncrowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels. “Up you \\ngo, Macmillan. ... Careful there, Miss Fawcett. ... \\nPinch it hard, it’ll stop bleeding in a second, Boot — \\n\\n“I think I’d better teach you how to block unfriendly \\nspells,” said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst \\nof the hall. He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes \\nglinted, and looked quickly away. “Let’s have a \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 214 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvolunteer pair — Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, \\nhow about you — ” \\n\\n“A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,” said Snape, gliding \\nover like a large and malevolent bat. “Longbottom \\ncauses devastation with the simplest spells. We’ll be \\nsending what’s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the \\nhospital wing in a matchbox.” Neville’s round, pink \\nface went pinker. “How about Malfoy and Potter?” \\nsaid Snape with a twisted smile. \\n\\n“Excellent idea!” said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and \\nMalfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed \\naway to give them room. \\n\\n“Now, Harry,” said Lockhart. “When Draco points his \\nwand at you, you do this.” \\n\\nHe raised his own wand, attempted a complicated \\nsort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked \\nas Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, “Whoops — \\nmy wand is a little overexcited — ” \\n\\nSnape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and \\nwhispered something in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. \\nHarry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, \\n“Professor, could you show me that blocking thing \\nagain?” \\n\\n“Scared?” muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn’t \\nhear him. \\n\\n“You wish,” said Harry out of the corner of his mouth. \\n\\nLockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. “Just \\ndo what I did, Harry!” \\n\\n“What, drop my wand?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 215 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Lockhart wasn’t listening. \\n\\n“Three — two — one — go!” he shouted. \\n\\nMalfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, \\n\\n“ Serpensortial” \\n\\nThe end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, \\nas a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto \\nthe floor between them, and raised itself, ready to \\nstrike. There were screams as the crowd backed \\nswiftly away, clearing the floor. \\n\\n“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly \\nenjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye \\nto eye with the angry snake. “I’ll get rid of it. ...” \\n\\n“Allow me!” shouted Lockhart. He brandished his \\nwand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the \\nsnake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air \\nand fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, \\nhissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin \\nFinch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed, \\npoised to strike. \\n\\nHarry wasn’t sure what made him do it. He wasn’t \\neven aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that \\nhis legs were carrying him forward as though he was \\non casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the \\nsnake, “Leave him alone!” And miraculously — \\ninexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor, docile \\nas a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. \\nHarry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the \\nsnake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how he \\nknew it, he couldn’t have explained. \\n\\nHe looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see \\nJustin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful — \\nbut certainly not angry and scared. \\n\\nPage | 216 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you think you’re playing at?” he shouted, \\nand before Harry could say anything, Justin had \\nturned and stormed out of the hall. \\n\\nSnape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the \\nsnake vanished in a small puff of black smoke. \\n\\nSnape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected \\nway: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry \\ndidn’t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous \\nmuttering all around the walls. Then he felt a tugging \\non the back of his robes. \\n\\n“Come on,” said Ron’s voice in his ear. “Move — come \\non—” \\n\\n\\n\\nRon steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying \\nalongside them. As they went through the doors, the \\npeople on either side drew away as though they were \\nfrightened of catching something. Harry didn’t have a \\nclue what was going on, and neither Ron nor \\nHermione explained anything until they had dragged \\nhim all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common \\nroom. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and \\nsaid, “You’re a Parselmouth. Why didn’t you tell us?” \\n\\n“I’m a what?” said Harry. \\n\\n“A Parselmouth .!” said Ron. “You can talk to snakes!” \\n\\n“I know,” said Harry. “I mean, that’s only the second \\ntime I’ve ever done it. I accidentally set a boa \\nconstrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once — \\nlong story — but it was telling me it had never seen \\nBrazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to — \\nthat was before I knew I was a wizard — ” \\n\\n“A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?” \\nRon repeated faintly. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 217 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“So?” said Harry. “I bet loads of people here can do it.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no they can’t,” said Ron. “It’s not a very common \\ngift. Harry, this is bad.” \\n\\n“What’s bad?” said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. \\n“What’s wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn’t told \\nthat snake not to attack Justin — ” \\n\\n“Oh, that’s what you said to it?” \\n\\n“What d’you mean? You were there — you heard me \\n\\n\\n\\n“I heard you speaking Parseltongue,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Snake language. You could have been saying \\nanything — no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded \\nlike you were egging the snake on or something — it \\nwas creepy, you know — ” \\n\\nHarry gaped at him. \\n\\n“I spoke a different language? But — I didn’t realize — \\nhow can I speak a language without knowing I can \\nspeak it?” \\n\\nRon shook his head. Both he and Hermione were \\nlooking as though someone had died. Harry couldn’t \\nsee what was so terrible. \\n\\n“D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a \\nmassive snake biting off Justin’s head?” he said. \\n“What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin \\ndoesn’t have to join the Headless Hunt?” \\n\\n“It matters,” said Hermione, speaking at last in a \\nhushed voice, “because being able to talk to snakes \\nwas what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That’s \\nwhy the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.” \\n\\nPage | 218 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry’s mouth fell open. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Ron. “And now the whole school’s \\ngoing to think you’re his great-great-great-great- \\ngrandson or something — ” \\n\\n“But I’m not,” said Harry, with a panic he couldn’t \\nquite explain. \\n\\n“You’ll find that hard to prove,” said Hermione. “He \\nlived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, \\nyou could be.” \\n\\n\\n\\n•k k k \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap \\nin the curtains around his four-poster he watched \\nsnow starting to drift past the tower window and \\nwondered ... \\n\\nCould he be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin? He \\ndidn’t know anything about his father’s family, after \\nall. The Dursleys had always forbidden questions \\nabout his wizarding relatives. \\n\\nQuietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. \\nThe words wouldn’t come. It seemed he had to be \\nface-to-face with a snake to do it. \\n\\nBut I’m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat \\nwouldn’t have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood. \\n\\n\\n\\nAh, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the \\nSorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don’t you \\nremember? \\n\\nHarry turned over. He’d see Justin the next day in \\nHerbology and he’d explain that he’d been calling the \\n\\nPage | 219 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsnake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, \\npummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized. \\n\\nBy next morning, however, the snow that had begun \\nin the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that \\nthe last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: \\nProfessor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on \\nthe Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust \\nto no one else, now that it was so important for the \\nMandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and \\nColin Creevey. \\n\\nHarry fretted about this next to the fire in the \\nGryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione \\nused their time off to play a game of wizard chess. \\n\\n“For heaven’s sake, Harry,” said Hermione, \\nexasperated, as one of Ron’s bishops wrestled her \\nknight off his horse and dragged him off the board. \\n\\n“Go and find Justin if it’s so important to you.” \\n\\nSo Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, \\nwondering where Justin might be. \\n\\nThe castle was darker than it usually was in daytime \\nbecause of the thick, swirling gray snow at every \\nwindow. Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms \\nwhere lessons were taking place, catching snatches of \\nwhat was happening within. Professor McGonagall \\nwas shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had \\nturned his friend into a badger. Resisting the urge to \\ntake a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin \\nmight be using his free time to catch up on some \\nwork, and deciding to check the library first. \\n\\nA group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in \\nHerbology were indeed sitting at the back of the \\nlibrary, but they didn’t seem to be working. Between \\nthe long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see \\n\\nPage | 220 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat their heads were close together and they were \\nhaving what looked like an absorbing conversation. \\nHe couldn’t see whether Justin was among them. He \\nwas walking toward them when something of what \\nthey were saying met his ears, and he paused to \\nlisten, hidden in the Invisibility section. \\n\\n“So anyway,” a stout boy was saying, “I told Justin to \\nhide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter’s \\nmarked him down as his next victim, it’s best if he \\nkeeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin’s \\nbeen waiting for something like this to happen ever \\nsince he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin \\nactually told him he’d been down for Eton. That’s not \\nthe kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin’s \\nheir on the loose, is it?” \\n\\n“You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?” said a \\ngirl with blonde pigtails anxiously. \\n\\n“Hannah,” said the stout boy solemnly, “he’s a \\nParselmouth. Everyone knows that’s the mark of a \\nDark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one \\nwho could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin \\nhimself Serpent-tongue.” \\n\\nThere was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie \\nwent on, “Remember what was written on the wall? \\nEnemies of the Heir, Beware. Potter had some sort of \\nrun-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch ’s cat’s \\nattacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying \\nPotter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him \\nwhile he was lying in the mud. Next thing we know — \\nCreevey ’s been attacked.” \\n\\n“He always seems so nice, though,” said Hannah \\nuncertainly, “and, well, he’s the one who made You- \\nKnow-Who disappear. He can’t be all bad, can he?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 221 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nErnie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs \\nbent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could \\ncatch Ernie’s words. \\n\\n“No one knows how he survived that attack by You- \\nKnow-Who. I mean to say, he was only a baby when it \\nhappened. He should have been blasted into \\nsmithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard \\ncould have survived a curse like that.” He dropped his \\nvoice until it was barely more than a whisper, and \\nsaid, “ That’s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to \\nkill him in the first place. Didn’t want another Dark \\nLord competing with him. I wonder what other powers \\nPotter’s been hiding?” \\n\\nHarry couldn’t take anymore. Clearing his throat \\nloudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves. \\n\\nIf he hadn’t been feeling so angry, he would have \\nfound the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of \\nthe Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been \\nPetrified by the sight of him, and the color was \\ndraining out of Ernie’s face. \\n\\n“Hello,” said Harry. “I’m looking for Justin Finch- \\nFletchley.” \\n\\nThe Hufflepuffs’ worst fears had clearly been \\nconfirmed. They all looked fearfully at Ernie. \\n\\n“What do you want with him?” said Ernie in a \\nquavering voice. \\n\\n“I wanted to tell him what really happened with that \\nsnake at the Dueling Club,” said Harry. \\n\\nErnie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep \\nbreath, said, “We were all there. We saw what \\nhappened.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 222 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake \\nbacked off?” said Harry. \\n\\n“All I saw,” said Ernie stubbornly, though he was \\ntrembling as he spoke, “was you speaking \\nParseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.” \\n\\n“I didn’t chase it at him!” Harry said, his voice \\nshaking with anger. “It didn’t even touch him!” \\n\\n“It was a very near miss,” said Ernie. “And in case \\nyou’re getting ideas,” he added hastily, “I might tell \\nyou that you can trace my family back through nine \\ngenerations of witches and warlocks and my blood’s \\nas pure as anyone’s, so — ” \\n\\n“I don’t care what sort of blood you’ve got!” said Harry \\nfiercely. “Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?” \\n\\n“I’ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,” said \\nErnie swiftly. \\n\\n“It’s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not \\nhate them,” said Harry. “I’d like to see you try it.” \\n\\nHe turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, \\nearning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince, \\nwho was polishing the gilded cover of a large \\nspellbook. \\n\\nHarry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing \\nwhere he was going, he was in such a fury. The result \\nwas that he walked into something very large and \\nsolid, which knocked him backward onto the floor. \\n\\n“Oh, hello, Hagrid,” Harry said, looking up. \\n\\nHagrid’s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow- \\ncovered balaclava, but it couldn’t possibly be anyone \\n\\nPage | 223 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nelse, as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin \\novercoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of his \\nmassive, gloved hands. \\n\\n“All righ’, Harry?” he said, pulling up the balaclava so \\nhe could speak. “Why aren’t yeh in class?” \\n\\n“Canceled,” said Harry, getting up. “What’re you doing \\nin here?” \\n\\nHagrid held up the limp rooster. \\n\\n“Second one killed this term,” he explained. “It’s \\neither foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, an’ I need \\nthe headmaster’s permission ter put a charm around \\nthe hen coop.” \\n\\nHe peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, \\nsnow-flecked eyebrows. \\n\\n“Yeh sure yeh’re all righ’? Yeh look all hot an’ \\nbothered — ” \\n\\nHarry couldn’t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and \\nthe rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him. \\n\\n“It’s nothing,” he said. “I’d better get going, Hagrid, it’s \\nTransfiguration next and I’ve got to pick up my \\nbooks.” \\n\\nHe walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had \\nsaid about him. \\n\\n“Justin’s been waiting for something like this to \\nhappen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle- \\nborn. ...” \\n\\nHarry stamped up the stairs and turned along \\nanother corridor, which was particularly dark; the \\n\\nPage | 224 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntorches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft \\nthat was blowing through a loose windowpane. He \\nwas halfway down the passage when he tripped \\nheadlong over something lying on the floor. \\n\\nHe turned to squint at what he’d fallen over and felt \\nas though his stomach had dissolved. \\n\\nJustin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid \\nand cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes \\nstaring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn’t all. \\n\\nNext to him was another figure, the strangest sight \\nHarry had ever seen. \\n\\nIt was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white \\nand transparent, but black and smoky, floating \\nimmobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His \\nhead was half off and his face wore an expression of \\nshock identical to Justin’s. \\n\\nHarry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, \\nhis heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs. He \\nlooked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and \\nsaw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could \\naway from the bodies. The only sounds were the \\nmuffled voices of teachers from the classes on either \\nside. \\n\\nHe could run, and no one would ever know he had \\nbeen there. But he couldn’t just leave them lying \\nhere. ... He had to get help. ... Would anyone believe \\nhe hadn’t had anything to do with this? \\n\\nAs he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him \\nopened with a bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came \\nshooting out. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 225 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, it’s potty wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, knocking \\nHarry’s glasses askew as he bounced past him. \\n“What’s Potter up to? Why’s Potter lurking — ” \\n\\nPeeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. \\nUpside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless \\nNick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, \\nbefore Harry could stop him, screamed, “ATTACK! \\nATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR \\nGHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! \\nATTAAAACK!” \\n\\nCrash — crash — crash — door after door flew open \\nalong the corridor and people flooded out. For several \\nlong minutes, there was a scene of such confusion \\nthat Justin was in danger of being squashed and \\npeople kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry \\nfound himself pinned against the wall as the teachers \\nshouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came \\nrunning, followed by her own class, one of whom still \\nhad black-and-white- striped hair. She used her wand \\nto set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and \\nordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner \\nhad the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the \\nHufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene. \\n\\n“ Caught in the act!” Ernie yelled, his face stark white, \\npointing his finger dramatically at Harry. \\n\\n“That will do, Macmillan!” said Professor McGonagall \\nsharply. \\n\\nPeeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, \\nsurveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As \\nthe teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless \\nNick, examining them, Peeves broke into song: \\n\\n“Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 226 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re killing off students, you think it’s good fun — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s enough, Peeves!” barked Professor \\nMcGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with \\nhis tongue out at Harry. \\n\\nJustin was carried up to the hospital wing by \\nProfessor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the \\nAstronomy department, but nobody seemed to know \\nwhat to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, \\nProfessor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin \\nair, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft \\nNearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did, \\nfanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This \\nleft Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together. \\n\\n“This way, Potter,” she said. \\n\\n“Professor,” said Harry at once, “I swear I didn’t — ” \\n\\n“This is out of my hands, Potter,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall curtly. \\n\\nThey marched in silence around a corner and she \\nstopped before a large and extremely ugly stone \\ngargoyle. \\n\\n“Lemon drop!” she said. This was evidently a \\npassword, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to \\nlife and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in \\ntwo. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry \\ncouldn’t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a \\nspiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, \\nlike an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall \\nstepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed \\nbehind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and \\nhigher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a \\ngleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the \\nshape of a griffin. \\n\\nPage | 227 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe knew now where he was being taken. This must be \\nwhere Dumbledore lived. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 228 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE POLY JUICE POTION \\n\\nThey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and \\nProfessor McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened \\nsilently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told \\nHarry to wait and left him there, alone. \\n\\nHarry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the \\nteachers’ offices Harry had visited so far this year, \\nDumbledore’s was by far the most interesting. If he \\nhadn’t been scared out of his wits that he was about \\nto be thrown out of school, he would have been very \\npleased to have a chance to look around it. \\n\\nIt was a large and beautiful circular room, full of \\nfunny little noises. A number of curious silver \\ninstruments stood on spindle-legged tables, whirring \\nand emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were \\ncovered with portraits of old headmasters and \\nheadmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in \\ntheir frames. There was also an enormous, claw- \\nfooted desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a \\nshabby, tattered wizard’s hat — the Sorting Hat \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 229 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the \\nsleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it \\ncouldn’t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on \\nagain? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him \\nin the right House — \\n\\nHe walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from \\nits shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was \\nmuch too large and slipped down over his eyes, just \\nas it had done the last time he’d put it on. Harry \\nstared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a \\nsmall voice said in his ear, “Bee in your bonnet, Harry \\nPotter?” \\n\\n“Er, yes,” Harry muttered. “Er — sorry to bother you \\n— I wanted to ask — ” \\n\\n“You’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right \\nHouse,” said the hat smartly. “Yes ... you were \\nparticularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I \\nsaid before” — Harry’s heart leapt — “you would have \\ndone well in Slytherin — ” \\n\\nHarry’s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of \\nthe hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, \\ngrubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its \\nshelf, feeling sick. \\n\\n“You’re wrong,” he said aloud to the still and silent \\nhat. It didn’t move. Harry backed away, watching it. \\nThen a strange, gagging noise behind him made him \\nwheel around. \\n\\nHe wasn’t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch \\nbehind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that \\nresembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it \\nand the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging \\nnoise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 230 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwere dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more \\nfeathers fell out of its tail. \\n\\nHarry was just thinking that all he needed was for \\nDumbledore ’s pet bird to die while he was alone in \\nthe office with it, when the bird burst into flames. \\n\\nHarry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. \\nHe looked feverishly around in case there was a glass \\nof water somewhere but couldn’t see one; the bird, \\nmeanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud \\nshriek and next second there was nothing but a \\nsmoldering pile of ash on the floor. \\n\\nThe office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking \\nvery somber. \\n\\n“Professor,” Harry gasped. “Your bird — I couldn’t do \\nanything — he just caught fire — ” \\n\\nTo Harry’s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled. \\n\\n“About time, too,” he said. “He’s been looking dreadful \\nfor days; I’ve been telling him to get a move on.” \\n\\nHe chuckled at the stunned look on Harry’s face. \\n\\n“Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into \\nflame when it is time for them to die and are reborn \\nfrom the ashes. Watch him ...” \\n\\nHarry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, \\nnewborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was \\nquite as ugly as the old one. \\n\\n“It’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,” \\nsaid Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. \\n“He’s really very handsome most of the time, \\nwonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating \\n\\nPage | 231 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncreatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely \\nheavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and \\nthey make highly faithful pets.” \\n\\nIn the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had \\nforgotten what he was there for, but it all came back \\nto him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high \\nchair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his \\npenetrating, light-blue stare. \\n\\nBefore Dumbledore could speak another word, \\nhowever, the door of the office flew open with an \\nalmighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his \\neyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black \\nhead and the dead rooster still swinging from his \\nhand. \\n\\n“It wasn’ Harry, Professor Dumbledore!” said Hagrid \\nurgently. “I was talkin’ ter him seconds before that \\nkid was found, he never had time, sir — ” \\n\\nDumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went \\nranting on, waving the rooster around in his \\nagitation, sending feathers everywhere. \\n\\n“ — it can’t’ve bin him, I’ll swear it in front o’ the \\nMinistry o’ Magic if I have to — ” \\n\\n“Hagrid, I — ” \\n\\n“ — yeh’ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never \\n\\n\\n\\n“Hagridl” said Dumbledore loudly. “I do not think that \\nHarry attacked those people.” \\n\\n“Oh,” said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his \\nside. “Right. I’ll wait outside then, Headmaster.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 232 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd he stomped out looking embarrassed. \\n\\n“You don’t think it was me, Professor?” Harry \\nrepeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster \\nfeathers off his desk. \\n\\n“No, Harry, I don’t,” said Dumbledore, though his face \\nwas somber again. “But I still want to talk to you.” \\n\\nHarry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered \\nhim, the tips of his long fingers together. \\n\\n“I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything \\nyou’d like to tell me,” he said gently. “Anything at all.” \\n\\nHarry didn’t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy \\nshouting, “You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the \\nPolyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle’s \\nbathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice \\nhe had heard twice and remembered what Ron had \\nsaid: “ Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good \\nsign, even in the wizarding world.” He thought, too, \\nabout what everyone was saying about him, and his \\ngrowing dread that he was somehow connected with \\nSalazar Slytherin. ... \\n\\n“No,” said Harry. “There isn’t anything, Professor. ...” \\n\\nThe double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless \\nNick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into \\nreal panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick’s \\nfate that seemed to worry people most. What could \\npossibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; \\nwhat terrible power could harm someone who was \\nalready dead? There was almost a stampede to book \\nseats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could \\ngo home for Christmas. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 233 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“At this rate, well be the only ones left,” Ron told \\nHarry and Hermione. “Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. \\nWhat a jolly holiday it’s going to be.” \\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy \\ndid, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But \\nHarry was glad that most people were leaving. He was \\ntired of people skirting around him in the corridors, \\nas though he were about to sprout fangs or spit \\npoison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and \\nhissing as he passed. \\n\\nFred and George, however, found all this very funny. \\nThey went out of their way to march ahead of Harry \\ndown the corridors, shouting, “Make way for the Heir \\nof Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through. ...” \\n\\nPercy was deeply disapproving of this behavior. \\n\\n“It is not a laughing matter,” he said coldly. \\n\\n“Oh, get out of the way, Percy,” said Fred. “Harry’s in \\na hurry.” \\n\\n“Yeah, he’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of \\ntea with his fanged servant,” said George, chortling. \\n\\nGinny didn’t find it amusing either. \\n\\n“Oh, don’t,” she wailed every time Fred asked Harry \\nloudly who he was planning to attack next, or when \\nGeorge pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove \\nof garlic when they met. \\n\\nHarry didn’t mind; it made him feel better that Fred \\nand George, at least, thought the idea of his being \\nSlytherin ’s heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics \\nseemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked \\nincreasingly sour each time he saw them at it. \\n\\nPage | 234 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s because he’s bursting to say it’s really him,” said \\nRon knowingly. “You know how he hates anyone \\nbeating him at anything, and you’re getting all the \\ncredit for his dirty work.” \\n\\n“Not for long,” said Hermione in a satisfied tone. “The \\nPolyjuice Potion’s nearly ready. We’ll be getting the \\ntruth out of him any day now.” \\n\\nAt last the term ended, and a silence deep as the \\nsnow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry \\nfound it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed \\nthe fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the \\nrun of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play \\nExploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and \\npractice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny \\nhad chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in \\nEgypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who \\ndisapproved of what he termed their childish \\nbehavior, didn’t spend much time in the Gryffindor \\ncommon room. He had already told them pompously \\nthat he was only staying over Christmas because it \\nwas his duty as a prefect to support the teachers \\nduring this troubled time. \\n\\nChristmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry \\nand Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were \\nwoken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully \\ndressed and carrying presents for them both. \\n\\n“Wake up,” she said loudly, pulling back the curtains \\nat the window. \\n\\n“Hermione — you’re not supposed to be in here — ” \\nsaid Ron, shielding his eyes against the light. \\n\\n“Merry Christmas to you, too,” said Hermione, \\nthrowing him his present. “I’ve been up for nearly an \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 235 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhour, adding more lace-wings to the potion. It’s \\nready.” \\n\\nHarry sat up, suddenly wide awake. \\n\\n“Are you sure?” \\n\\n“Positive,” said Hermione, shirting Scabbers the rat so \\nthat she could sit down on the end of Ron’s four- \\nposter. “If we’re going to do it, I say it should be \\ntonight.” \\n\\nAt that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, \\ncarrying a very small package in her beak. \\n\\n“Hello,” said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \\n“Are you speaking to me again?” \\n\\nShe nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, \\nwhich was a far better present than the one that she \\nhad brought him, which turned out to be from the \\nDursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note \\ntelling him to find out whether he’d be able to stay at \\nHogwarts for the summer vacation, too. \\n\\nThe rest of Harry’s Christmas presents were far more \\nsatisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle \\ntoffee, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before \\neating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with \\nthe Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his \\nfavorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought \\nhim a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the \\nlast present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from \\nMrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card \\nwith a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. \\nWeasley’s car (which hadn’t been seen since its crash \\nwith the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule- \\nbreaking he and Ron were planning next. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 236 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice \\nPotion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at \\nHogwarts. \\n\\nThe Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were \\nthere a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick \\nstreamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the \\nceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and \\ndry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of \\nhis favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more \\nloudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. \\n\\nPercy, who hadn’t noticed that Fred had bewitched \\nhis prefect badge so that it now read “Pin-head,” kept \\nasking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry \\ndidn’t even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, \\nsnide remarks about his new sweater from the \\nSlytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be \\ngetting his comeuppance in a few hours’ time. \\n\\nHarry and Ron had barely finished their third \\nhelpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione \\nushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for \\nthe evening. \\n\\n“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing \\ninto,” said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she \\nwere sending them to the supermarket for laundry \\ndetergent. “And obviously, it’ll be best if you can get \\nsomething of Crabbe’s and Goyle’s; they’re Malfoy’s \\nbest friends, he’ll tell them anything. And we also \\nneed to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can’t \\nburst in on us while we’re interrogating him. \\n\\n“I’ve got it all worked out,” she went on smoothly, \\nignoring Harry’s and Ron’s stupefied faces. She held \\nup two plump chocolate cakes. “I’ve filled these with a \\nsimple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make \\nsure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how \\ngreedy they are, they’re bound to eat them. Once \\nPage | 237 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey’re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide \\nthem in a broom closet.” \\n\\nHarry and Ron looked incredulously at each other. \\n\\n“Hermione, I don’t think — ” \\n\\n“That could go seriously wrong — ” \\n\\nBut Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike \\nthe one Professor McGonagall sometimes had. \\n\\n“The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and \\nGoyle’s hair,” she said sternly. “You do want to \\ninvestigate Malfoy, don’t you?” \\n\\n“Oh, all right, all right,” said Harry. “But what about \\nyou? Whose hair are you ripping out?” \\n\\n“I’ve already got mine!” said Hermione brightly, \\npulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing \\nthem the single hair inside it. “Remember Millicent \\nBulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She \\nleft this on my robes when she was trying to strangle \\nme! And she’s gone home for Christmas — so I’ll just \\nhave to tell the Slytherins I’ve decided to come back.” \\n\\nWhen Hermione had bustled off to check on the \\nPolyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a \\ndoom-laden expression. \\n\\n“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things \\ncould go wrong?” \\n\\nBut to Harry’s and Ron’s utter amazement, stage one \\nof the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione \\nhad said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall \\nafter Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle \\nwho had remained alone at the Slytherin table, \\n\\nPage | 238 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had \\nperched the chocolate cakes on the end of the \\nbanisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle \\ncoming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid \\nquickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door. \\n\\n“How thick can you get?” Ron whispered ecstatically \\nas Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle \\nand grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the \\ncakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, \\nboth of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on \\ntheir faces. Then, without the smallest change of \\nexpression, they both keeled over backward onto the \\nfloor. \\n\\nBy far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet \\nacross the hall. Once they were safely stowed among \\nthe buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of \\nthe bristles that covered Goyle ’s forehead and Ron \\npulled out several of Crabbe ’s hairs. They also stole \\ntheir shoes, because their own were far too small for \\nCrabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at \\nwhat they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning \\nMyrtle’s bathroom. \\n\\nThey could hardly see for the thick black smoke \\nissuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring \\nthe cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, \\nHarry and Ron knocked softly on the door. \\n\\n“Hermione?” \\n\\nThey heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione \\nemerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious. Behind \\nher they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, \\nglutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on \\nthe toilet seat. \\n\\n“Did you get them?” Hermione asked breathlessly. \\n\\nPage | 239 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry showed her Goyle’s hair. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the \\nlaundry,” Hermione said, holding up a small sack. \\n“You’ll need bigger sizes once you’re Crabbe and \\nGoyle.” \\n\\nThe three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, \\nthe potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling \\nsluggishly. \\n\\n“I’m sure I’ve done everything right,” said Hermione, \\nnervously rereading the splotched page of Moste \\nPotente Potions. “It looks like the book says it should \\n... once we’ve drunk it, we’ll have exactly an hour \\nbefore we change back into ourselves.” \\n\\n“Now what?” Ron whispered. \\n\\n“We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.” \\n\\nHermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each \\nof the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook \\nMillicent Bulstrode’s hair out of its bottle into the first \\nglass. \\n\\nThe potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and \\nfrothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick \\nsort of yellow. \\n\\n“Urgh — essence of Millicent Bulstrode,” said Ron, \\neyeing it with loathing. “Bet it tastes disgusting.” \\n\\n“Add yours, then,” said Hermione. \\n\\nHarry dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and \\nRon put Crabbe’s into the last one. Both glasses \\nhissed and frothed: Goyle’s turned the khaki color of \\na booger, Crabbe’s a dark, murky brown. \\n\\nPage | 240 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hang on,” said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached \\nfor their glasses. “We’d better not all drink them in \\nhere. ... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won’t \\nfit. And Millicent Bulstrode’s no pixie.” \\n\\n“Good thinking,” said Ron, unlocking the door. “We’ll \\ntake separate stalls.” \\n\\nCareful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, \\nHarry slipped into the middle stall. \\n\\n“Ready?” he called. \\n\\n“Ready,” came Ron’s and Hermione’s voices. \\n\\n“One — two — three — ” \\n\\nPinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in \\ntwo large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage. \\n\\nImmediately, his insides started writhing as though \\nhe’d just swallowed live snakes — doubled up, he \\nwondered whether he was going to be sick — then a \\nburning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to \\nthe very ends of his fingers and toes — next, bringing \\nhim gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting \\nfeeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot \\nwax — and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, \\nthe fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the \\nknuckles were bulging like bolts — his shoulders \\nstretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead \\ntold him that hair was creeping down toward his \\neyebrows — his robes ripped as his chest expanded \\nlike a barrel bursting its hoops — his feet were agony \\nin shoes four sizes too small — \\n\\nAs suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. \\nHarry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening \\nto Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With \\n\\nPage | 241 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndifficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So \\nthis was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand \\ntrembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were \\nhanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare \\nones, and laced up Goyle’s boatlike shoes. He reached \\nup to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the \\nshort growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. \\nThen he realized that his glasses were clouding his \\neyes because Goyle obviously didn’t need them — he \\ntook them off and called, “Are you two okay?” Goyle’s \\nlow rasp of a voice issued from his mouth. \\n\\n“Yeah,” came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right. \\n\\nHarry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the \\ncracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull, \\ndeepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle. \\n\\nRon’s door opened. They stared at each other. Except \\nthat he looked pale and shocked, Ron was \\nindistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding- \\nbowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms. \\n\\n“This is unbelievable,” said Ron, approaching the \\nmirror and prodding Crabbe ’s flat nose. \\n\\n“Unbelievable.” \\n\\n“We’d better get going,” said Harry, loosening the \\nwatch that was cutting into Goyle’s thick wrist. “We’ve \\nstill got to find out where the Slytherin common room \\nis. I only hope we can find someone to follow ...” \\n\\nRon, who had been gazing at Harry, said, “You don’t \\nknow how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.” He \\nbanged on Hermione’s door. “C’mon, we need to go — ” \\n\\nA high-pitched voice answered him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 242 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I — I don’t think I’m going to come after all. You go \\non without me.” \\n\\n“Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode’s ugly, no \\none’s going to know it’s you — ” \\n\\n“No — really — I don’t think I’ll come. You two hurry \\nup, you’re wasting time — ” \\n\\nHarry looked at Ron, bewildered. \\n\\n“That looks more like Goyle,” said Ron. “That’s how he \\nlooks every time a teacher asks him a question.” \\n\\n“Hermione, are you okay?” said Harry through the \\ndoor. \\n\\n“Fine — I’m fine — go on — ” \\n\\nHarry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty \\nminutes had already passed. \\n\\n“Well meet you back here, all right?” he said. \\n\\nHarry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom \\ncarefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set \\noff. \\n\\n“Don’t swing your arms like that,” Harry muttered to \\nRon. \\n\\n“Eh?” \\n\\n“Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. ...” \\n\\n“How’s this?” \\n\\n“Yeah, that’s better. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 243 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey went down the marble staircase. All they needed \\nnow was a Slytherin that they could follow to the \\nSlytherin common room, but there was nobody \\naround. \\n\\n“Any ideas?” muttered Harry. \\n\\n“The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from \\nover there,” said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the \\ndungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when \\na girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance. \\n\\n“Excuse me,” said Ron, hurrying up to her. “We’ve \\nforgotten the way to our common room.” \\n\\n“I beg your pardon?” said the girl stiffly. “Our common \\nroom? I’m a Ravenclaw.” \\n\\nShe walked away, looking suspiciously back at them. \\n\\nHarry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the \\ndarkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly \\nas Crabbe’s and Goyle’s huge feet hit the floor, feeling \\nthat this wasn’t going to be as easy as they had \\nhoped. \\n\\nThe labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked \\ndeeper and deeper under the school, constantly \\nchecking their watches to see how much time they \\nhad left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they \\nwere getting desperate, they heard a sudden \\nmovement ahead. \\n\\n“Ha!” said Ron excitedly. “There’s one of them now!” \\n\\nThe figure was emerging from a side room. As they \\nhurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn’t a \\nSlytherin, it was Percy. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 244 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’re you doing down here?” said Ron in surprise. \\nPercy looked affronted. \\n\\n“That,” he said stiffly, “is none of your business. It’s \\nCrabbe, isn’t it?” \\n\\n“Wh — oh, yeah,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Well, get off to your dormitories,” said Percy sternly. \\n“It’s not safe to go wandering around dark corridors \\nthese days.” \\n\\n“You are,” Ron pointed out. \\n\\n“I,” said Percy, drawing himself up, “am a prefect. \\nNothing’s about to attack me.” \\n\\nA voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. \\n\\nDraco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the \\nfirst time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him. \\n\\n“There you are,” he drawled, looking at them. “Have \\nyou two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this \\ntime? I’ve been looking for you; I want to show you \\nsomething really funny.” \\n\\nMalfoy glanced witheringly at Percy. \\n\\n“And what’re you doing down here, Weasley?” he \\nsneered. \\n\\nPercy looked outraged. \\n\\n“You want to show a bit more respect to a school \\nprefect!” he said. “I don’t like your attitude!” \\n\\nMalfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to \\nfollow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to \\n\\nPage | 245 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPercy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron \\nhurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the \\nnext passage, “That Peter Weasley — ” \\n\\n“Percy,” Ron corrected him automatically. \\n\\n“Whatever,” said Malfoy. “I’ve noticed him sneaking \\naround a lot lately. And I bet I know what he’s up to. \\nHe thinks he’s going to catch Slytherin’s heir single- \\nhanded.” \\n\\nHe gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron \\nexchanged excited looks. \\n\\nMalfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall. \\n“What’s the new password again?” he said to Harry. \\n“Er — ” said Harry. \\n\\n“Oh, yeah — pure-blood\\\\” said Malfoy, not listening, \\nand a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. \\nMalfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron \\nfollowed him. \\n\\nThe Slytherin common room was a long, low \\nunderground room with rough stone walls and ceiling \\nfrom which round, greenish lamps were hanging on \\nchains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately \\ncarved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several \\nSlytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed \\nchairs. \\n\\n“Wait here,” said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning \\nthem to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire. \\n“I’ll go and get it — my father’s just sent it to me — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 246 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWondering what Malfoy was going to show them, \\nHarry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at \\nhome. \\n\\nMalfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked \\nlike a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron’s \\nnose. \\n\\n“That’ll give you a laugh,” he said. \\n\\nHarry saw Ron\\'s eyes widen in shock. He read the \\nclipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and \\nhanded it to Harry. \\n\\nIt had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it \\nsaid: \\n\\nINQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC \\n\\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle \\nArtifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for \\nbewitching a Muggle car. \\n\\nMr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of \\nWitchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car \\ncrashed earlier this year, called today for Mr. \\nWeasley’s resignation. \\n\\n“Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,” \\n\\nMr. Malfoy told our reporter. “He is clearly unfit to \\ndraw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle \\nProtection Act should be scrapped immediately.” \\n\\nMr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although \\nhis wife told reporters to clear off or she’d set the \\nfamily ghoul on them. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 247 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?” said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the \\nclipping back to him. “Don’t you think it’s funny?” \\n\\n“Ha, ha,” said Harry bleakly. \\n\\n“Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should \\nsnap his wand in half and go and join them,” said \\nMalfoy scornfully. “You’d never know the Weasleys \\nwere purebloods, the way they behave.” \\n\\nRon’s — or rather, Crabbe’s — face was contorted \\nwith fury. \\n\\n“What’s up with you, Crabbe?” snapped Malfoy. \\n“Stomachache,” Ron grunted. \\n\\n“Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those \\nMudbloods a kick from me,” said Malfoy, snickering. \\n“You know, I’m surprised the Daily Prophet hasn’t \\nreported all these attacks yet,” he went on \\nthoughtfully. “I suppose Dumbledore’s trying to hush \\nit all up. He’ll be sacked if it doesn’t stop soon. \\nFather’s always said old Dumbledore’s the worst thing \\nthat’s ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle- \\nborns. A decent headmaster would never ’ve let slime \\nlike that Creevey in.” \\n\\nMalfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary \\ncamera and did a cruel but accurate impression of \\nColin: “ ‘Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I \\nhave your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, \\nPotter?’ ” \\n\\nHe dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron. \\n“What’s the matter with you two?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 248 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFar too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to \\nlaugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe \\nand Goyle were always slow on the uptake. \\n\\n“Saint Potter, the Mudbloods’ friend,” said Malfoy \\nslowly. “He’s another one with no proper wizard \\nfeeling, or he wouldn’t go around with that jumped-up \\nGranger Mudblood. And people think he’s Slytherin’s \\nheir!” \\n\\nHarry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was \\nsurely seconds away from telling them it was him — \\nbut then — \\n\\n“I wish I knew who it is,” said Malfoy petulantly. “I \\ncould help them.” \\n\\nRon’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more \\nclueless than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn’t notice, \\nand Harry, thinking fast, said, “You must have some \\nidea who’s behind it all. ...” \\n\\n“You know I haven’t, Goyle, how many times do I have \\nto tell you?” snapped Malfoy. “And Father won’t tell \\nme anything about the last time the Chamber was \\nopened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it \\nwas before his time, but he knows all about it, and he \\nsays that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious \\nif I know too much about it. But I know one thing — \\nlast time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a \\nMudblood died. So I bet it’s a matter of time before \\none of them’s killed this time. ... I hope it’s Granger,” \\nhe said with relish. \\n\\nRon was clenching Crabbe ’s gigantic fists. Feeling \\nthat it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched \\nMalfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, \\n“D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber \\nlast time was caught?” \\n\\nPage | 249 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,” said \\nMalfoy. “They’re probably still in Azkaban.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Azkaban?” said Harry, puzzled. \\n\\n“Azkaban — the wizard prison , Goyle,” said Malfoy, \\nlooking at him in disbelief. “Honestly, if you were any \\nslower, you’d be going backward.” \\n\\nHe shifted restlessly in his chair and said, “Father \\nsays to keep my head down and let the Heir of \\nSlytherin get on with it. He says the school needs \\nridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed \\nup in it. Of course, he’s got a lot on his plate at the \\nmoment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our \\nmanor last week?” \\n\\nHarry tried to force Goyle ’s dull face into a look of \\nconcern. \\n\\n“Yeah ...” said Malfoy. “Luckily, they didn’t find much. \\nFather’s got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But \\nluckily, we’ve got our own secret chamber under the \\ndrawing-room floor — ” \\n\\n“Ho!” said Ron. \\n\\nMalfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. \\n\\nEven his hair was turning red. His nose was also \\nslowly lengthening — their hour was up, Ron was \\nturning back into himself, and from the look of horror \\nhe was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too. \\n\\nThey both jumped to their feet. \\n\\n“Medicine for my stomach,” Ron grunted, and without \\nfurther ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin \\ncommon room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, \\nand dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that \\n\\nPage | 250 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMalfoy hadn’t noticed anything. Harry could feel his \\nfeet slipping around in Goyle’s huge shoes and had to \\nhoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the \\nsteps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a \\nmuffled pounding coming from the closet where \\nthey’d locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes \\noutside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks \\nup the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle’s \\nbathroom. \\n\\n“Well, it wasn’t a complete waste of time,” Ron \\npanted, closing the bathroom door behind them. “I \\nknow we still haven’t found out who’s doing the \\nattacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and \\ntell him to check under the Malfoys’ drawing room.” \\n\\nHarry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was \\nback to normal. He put his glasses on as Ron \\nhammered on the door of Hermione’s stall. \\n\\n“Hermione, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you — ” \\n\\n“Go away!” Hermione squeaked. \\n\\nHarry and Ron looked at each other. \\n\\n“What’s the matter?” said Ron. “You must be back to \\nnormal by now, we are — ” \\n\\nBut Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall \\ndoor. Harry had never seen her looking so happy. \\n\\n“Ooooooh, wait till you see,” she said. “It’s awful — ” \\n\\nThey heard the lock slide back and Hermione \\nemerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head. \\n\\n“What’s up?” said Ron uncertainly. “Have you still got \\nMillicent’s nose or something?” \\n\\nPage | 251 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the \\nsink. \\n\\nHer face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had \\nturned yellow and there were long, pointed ears \\npoking through her hair. \\n\\n“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled. “M-Millicent \\nBulstrode m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn’t \\nsupposed to be used for animal transformations!” \\n\\n“Uh-oh,” said Ron. \\n\\n“You’ll be teased something dreadful,” said Myrtle \\nhappily. \\n\\n“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take \\nyou up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never \\nasks too many questions. ...” \\n\\nIt took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the \\nbathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way \\nwith a hearty guffaw. “Wait till everyone finds out \\nyou’ve got a tail\\\\” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 252 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* V \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE VERY SECRET DIARY \\n\\nHermione remained in the hospital wing for several \\nweeks. There was a flurry of rumor about her \\ndisappearance when the rest of the school arrived \\nback from their Christmas holidays, because of \\ncourse everyone thought that she had been attacked. \\nSo many students filed past the hospital wing trying \\nto catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took \\nout her curtains again and placed them around \\nHermione’s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen \\nwith a furry face. \\n\\nHarry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When \\nthe new term started, they brought her each day’s \\nhomework. \\n\\n“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,” \\nsaid Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione’s \\nbedside table one evening. \\n\\n“Don’t be silly, Ron, I’ve got to keep up,” said \\nHermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved \\nby the fact that all the hair had gone from her face \\n\\nPage | 253 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nand her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. “I \\ndon’t suppose you’ve got any new leads?” she added \\nin a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn’t hear \\nher. \\n\\n“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily. \\n\\n“I was so sure it was Malfoy,” said Ron, for about the \\nhundredth time. \\n\\n“What’s that?” asked Harry, pointing to something \\ngold sticking out from under Hermione’s pillow. \\n\\n“Just a get well card,” said Hermione hastily, trying to \\npoke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He \\npulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud: \\n\\n“To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from \\nyour concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, \\nOrder of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the \\nDark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of \\nWitch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award.” \\n\\nRon looked up at Hermione, disgusted. \\n\\n“You sleep with this under your pillow?” \\n\\nBut Hermione was spared answering by Madam \\nPomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of \\nmedicine. \\n\\n“Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or \\nwhat?” Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary \\nand started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower. \\nSnape had given them so much homework, Harry \\nthought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he \\nfinished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had \\nasked Hermione how many rat tails you were \\nsupposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an \\nPage | 254 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nangry outburst from the floor above reached their \\nears. \\n\\n“That’s Filch,” Harry muttered as they hurried up the \\nstairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard. \\n\\n“You don’t think someone else’s been attacked?” said \\nRon tensely. \\n\\nThey stood still, their heads inclined toward Filch’s \\nvoice, which sounded quite hysterical. \\n\\n“ — even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I \\nhaven’t got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I’m \\ngoing to Dumbledore — ” \\n\\nHis footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor \\nand they heard a distant door slam. \\n\\nThey poked their heads around the corner. Filch had \\nclearly been manning his usual lookout post: They \\nwere once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had \\nbeen attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had \\nbeen shouting about. A great flood of water stretched \\nover half the corridor, and it looked as though it was \\nstill seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle’s \\nbathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they \\ncould hear Myrtle’s wails echoing off the bathroom \\nwalls. \\n\\n“Now what’s up with her?” said Ron. \\n\\n“Let’s go and see,” said Harry, and holding their robes \\nover their ankles they stepped through the great wash \\nof water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, \\nignored it as always, and entered. \\n\\nMoaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and \\nharder than ever before. She seemed to be hiding \\n\\nPage | 255 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndown her usual toilet. It was dark in the bathroom \\nbecause the candles had been extinguished in the \\ngreat rush of water that had left both walls and floor \\nsoaking wet. \\n\\n“What’s up, Myrtle?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Who’s that?” glugged Myrtle miserably. “Come to \\nthrow something else at me?” \\n\\nHarry waded across to her stall and said, “Why would \\nI throw something at you?” \\n\\n“Don’t ask me,” Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave \\nof yet more water, which splashed onto the already \\nsopping floor. “Here I am, minding my own business, \\nand someone thinks it’s funny to throw a book at me. \\n\\n\\n\\n“But it can’t hurt you if someone throws something at \\nyou,” said Harry, reasonably. “I mean, it’d just go \\nright through you, wouldn’t it?” \\n\\nHe had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up \\nand shrieked, “Let’s all throw books at Myrtle, \\nbecause she can’t feel it! Ten points if you can get it \\nthrough her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through \\nher head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don’t \\nthink!” \\n\\n“Who threw it at you, anyway?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“I don’t know. ... I was just sitting in the U-bend, \\nthinking about death, and it fell right through the top \\nof my head,” said Myrtle, glaring at them. “It’s over \\nthere, it got washed out. ...” \\n\\nHarry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle \\nwas pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a \\n\\nPage | 256 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshabby black cover and was as wet as everything else \\nin the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up, \\nbut Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back. \\n\\n“What?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Are you cra2y?” said Ron. “It could be dangerous.” \\n\\n“ Dangerous ?” said Harry, laughing. “Come off it, how \\ncould it be dangerous?” \\n\\n“You’d be surprised,” said Ron, who was looking \\napprehensively at the book. “Some of the books the \\nMinistry’s confiscated — Dad’s told me — there was \\none that burned your eyes out. And everyone who \\nread Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the \\nrest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a \\nbook that you could never stop reading ! You just had \\nto wander around with your nose in it, trying to do \\neverything one-handed. And — ” \\n\\n“All right, I’ve got the point,” said Harry. \\n\\nThe little book lay on the floor, nondescript and \\nsoggy. \\n\\n“Well, we won’t find out unless we look at it,” he said, \\nand he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the \\nfloor. \\n\\nHarry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded \\nyear on the cover told him it was fifty years old. He \\nopened it eagerly. On the first page he could just \\nmake out the name “T. M. Riddle” in smudged ink. \\n\\n“Hang on,” said Ron, who had approached cautiously \\nand was looking over Harry’s shoulder. “I know that \\nname. ... T. M. Riddle got an award for special \\nservices to the school fifty years ago.” \\n\\nPage | 257 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“How on earth d’you know that?” said Harry in \\namazement. \\n\\n“Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty \\ntimes in detention,” said Ron resentfully. “That was \\nthe one I burped slugs all over. If you’d wiped slime \\noff a name for an hour, you’d remember it, too.” \\n\\nHarry peeled the wet pages apart. They were \\ncompletely blank. There wasn’t the faintest trace of \\nwriting on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel’s \\nbirthday, or dentist, half-past three. \\n\\n“He never wrote in it,” said Harry, disappointed. \\n\\n“I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?” said \\nRon curiously. \\n\\nHarry turned to the back cover of the book and saw \\nthe printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, \\nLondon. \\n\\n“He must’ve been Muggle-born,” said Harry \\nthoughtfully. “To have bought a diary from Vauxhall \\nRoad. ...” \\n\\n“Well, it’s not much use to you,” said Ron. He \\ndropped his voice. “Fifty points if you can get it \\nthrough Myrtle’s nose.” \\n\\nHarry, however, pocketed it. \\n\\nHermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail- \\nless, and fur-free, at the beginning of February. On \\nher first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry \\nshowed her T. M. Riddle’s diary and told her the story \\nof how they had found it. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 258 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oooh, it might have hidden powers,” said Hermione \\nenthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it \\nclosely. \\n\\n“If it has, it’s hiding them very well,” said Ron. “Maybe \\nit’s shy. I don’t know why you don’t chuck it, Harry.” \\n\\n“I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,” said \\nHarry. “I wouldn’t mind knowing how Riddle got an \\naward for special services to Hogwarts either.” \\n\\n“Could’ve been anything,” said Ron. “Maybe he got \\nthirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant \\nsquid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would’ve done \\neveryone a favor. ...” \\n\\nBut Harry could tell from the arrested look on \\nHermione ’s face that she was thinking what he was \\nthinking. \\n\\n“What?” said Ron, looking from one to the other. \\n\\n“Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years \\nago, wasn’t it?” he said. “That’s what Malfoy said.” \\n\\n“Yeah ...” said Ron slowly. \\n\\n“And this diary is fifty years old,” said Hermione, \\ntapping it excitedly. \\n\\n“So?” \\n\\n“Oh, Ron, wake up,” snapped Hermione. “We know \\nthe person who opened the Chamber last time was \\nexpelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an \\naward for special services to the school fifty years \\nago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for \\ncatching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would \\nprobably tell us everything — where the Chamber is, \\nPage | 259 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in \\nit — the person who’s behind the attacks this time \\nwouldn’t want that lying around, would they?” \\n\\n“That’s a brilliant theory, Hermione,” said Ron, “with \\njust one tiny little flaw. There’s nothing written in his \\ndiary.” \\n\\nBut Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag. \\n\\n“It might be invisible ink!” she whispered. \\n\\nShe tapped the diary three times and said, \\n“Aparecium\\\\” \\n\\nNothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her \\nhand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared \\nto be a bright red eraser. \\n\\n“It’s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,” she said. \\n\\nShe rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened. \\n\\n“I’m telling you, there’s nothing to find in there,” said \\nRon. “Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and \\ncouldn’t be bothered filling it in.” \\n\\nHarry couldn’t explain, even to himself, why he didn’t \\njust throw Riddle’s diary away. The fact was that even \\nthough he knew the diary was blank, he kept \\nabsentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, \\nas though it were a story he wanted to finish. And \\nwhile Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. \\nM. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to \\nhim, almost as though Riddle was a friend he’d had \\nwhen he was very small, and had half-forgotten. But \\nthis was absurd. He’d never had friends before \\nHogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 260 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more \\nabout Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the \\ntrophy room to examine Riddle’s special award, \\naccompanied by an interested Hermione and a \\nthoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he’d \\nseen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime. \\n\\nRiddle’s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a \\ncorner cabinet. It didn’t carry details of why it had \\nbeen given to him (“Good thing, too, or it’d be even \\nbigger and I’d still be polishing it,” said Ron). \\n\\nHowever, they did find Riddle’s name on an old Medal \\nfor Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys. \\n\\n“He sounds like Percy,” said Ron, wrinkling his nose \\nin disgust. “Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every \\nclass — ” \\n\\n“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” said Hermione in a \\nslightly hurt voice. \\n\\nThe sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts \\nagain. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more \\nhopeful. There had been no more attacks since those \\non Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam \\nPomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes \\nwere becoming moody and secretive, meaning that \\nthey were fast leaving childhood. \\n\\n“The moment their acne clears up, they’ll be ready for \\nrepotting again,” Harry heard her telling Filch kindly \\none afternoon. “And after that, it won’t be long until \\nwe’re cutting them up and stewing them. You’ll have \\nMrs. Norris back in no time.” \\n\\nPerhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her \\nnerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and \\nriskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the \\nschool so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, \\n\\nPage | 261 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhatever it was, was even now settling itself down to \\nhibernate for another fifty years. ... \\n\\n\\n\\nErnie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn’t take this cheerful \\nview. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty \\none, that he had “given himself away” at the Dueling \\nClub. Peeves wasn’t helping matters; he kept popping \\nup in the crowded corridors singing “Oh, Potter, you \\nrotter ...” now with a dance routine to match. \\n\\nGilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had \\nmade the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling \\nProfessor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were \\nlining up for Transfiguration. \\n\\n“I don’t think there’ll be any more trouble, Minerva,” \\nhe said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. “I \\nthink the Chamber has been locked for good this \\ntime. The culprit must have known it was only a \\nmatter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to \\nstop now, before I came down hard on him. \\n\\n“You know, what the school needs now is a morale- \\nbooster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won’t \\nsay any more just now, but I think I know just the \\nthing. ...” \\n\\nHe tapped his nose again and strode off. \\n\\nLockhart’s idea of a morale-booster became clear at \\nbreakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn’t \\nhad much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch \\npractice the night before, and he hurried down to the \\nGreat Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, \\nthat he’d walked through the wrong doors. \\n\\nThe walls were all covered with large, lurid pink \\nflowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling \\nfrom the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the \\n\\nPage | 262 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking \\nsickened, and Hermione seemed to have been \\novercome with giggles. \\n\\n“What’s going on?” Harry asked them, sitting down \\nand wiping confetti off his bacon. \\n\\nRon pointed to the teachers’ table, apparently too \\ndisgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink \\nrobes to match the decorations, was waving for \\nsilence. The teachers on either side of him were \\nlooking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could \\nsee a muscle going in Professor McGonagall’s cheek. \\nSnape looked as though someone had just fed him a \\nlarge beaker of Skele-Gro. \\n\\n“Happy Valentine’s Day!” Lockhart shouted. “And may \\nI thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me \\ncards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this \\nlittle surprise for you all — and it doesn’t end here!” \\n\\nLockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to \\nthe entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking \\ndwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had \\nthem all wearing golden wings and carrying harps. \\n\\n“My friendly, card-carrying cupids!” beamed Lockhart. \\n“They will be roving around the school today \\ndelivering your valentines! And the fun doesn’t stop \\nhere! I’m sure my colleagues will want to enter into \\nthe spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor \\nSnape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And \\nwhile you’re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more \\nabout Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I’ve \\never met, the sly old dog!” \\n\\nProfessor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape \\nwas looking as though the first person to ask him for \\na Love Potion would be force-fed poison. \\n\\nPage | 263 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Please, Hermione, tell me you weren’t one of the \\nforty-six,” said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their \\nfirst lesson. Hermione suddenly became very \\ninterested in searching her bag for her schedule and \\ndidn’t answer. \\n\\nAll day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their \\nclasses to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the \\nteachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors \\nwere walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs \\ncaught up with Harry. \\n\\n“Oy, you! ’Arry Potter!” shouted a particularly grim- \\nlooking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to \\nHarry. \\n\\nHot all over at the thought of being given a valentine \\nin front of a line of first years, which happened to \\ninclude Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The \\ndwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by \\nkicking people’s shins, and reached him before he’d \\ngone two paces. \\n\\n“I’ve got a musical message to deliver to ’Arry Potter in \\nperson,” he said, twanging his harp in a threatening \\nsort of way. \\n\\n“Not here,” Harry hissed, trying to escape. \\n\\n“Stay stilll” grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of \\nHarry’s bag and pulling him back. \\n\\n“Let me go!” Harry snarled, tugging. \\n\\nWith a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His \\nbooks, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the \\nfloor and his ink bottle smashed over everything. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 264 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up \\nbefore the dwarf started singing, causing something of \\na holdup in the corridor. \\n\\n“What’s going on here?” came the cold, drawling voice \\nof Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything \\nfeverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away \\nbefore Malfoy could hear his musical valentine. \\n\\n“What’s all this commotion?” said another familiar \\nvoice as Percy Weasley arrived. \\n\\nLosing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but \\nthe dwarf seized him around the knees and brought \\nhim crashing to the floor. \\n\\n“Right,” he said, sitting on Harry’s ankles. “Here is \\nyour singing valentine: \\n\\nHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, \\n\\nHis hair is as dark as a blackboard. \\n\\nI wish he was mine, he’s really divine, \\n\\nThe hero who conquered the Dark Lord.” \\n\\nHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to \\nevaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along \\nwith everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the \\nweight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to \\ndisperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with \\nmirth. \\n\\n“Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, \\noff to class, now,” he said, shooing some of the \\nyounger students away. “And you, Malfoy — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 265 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up \\nsomething. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and \\nGoyle, and Harry realized that he’d got Riddle’s diary. \\n\\n“Give that back,” said Harry quietly. \\n\\n“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” said Malfoy, \\nwho obviously hadn’t noticed the year on the cover \\nand thought he had Harry’s own diary. A hush fell \\nover the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary \\nto Harry, looking terrified. \\n\\n“Hand it over, Malfoy,” said Percy sternly. \\n\\n“When I’ve had a look,” said Malfoy, waving the diary \\ntauntingly at Harry. \\n\\nPercy said, “As a school prefect — ” but Harry had lost \\nhis temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \\n\\n“ ExpelliarmusV’ and just as Snape had disarmed \\nLockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of \\nhis hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught \\nit. \\n\\n“Harry!” said Percy loudly. “No magic in the corridors. \\nI’ll have to report this, you know!” \\n\\nBut Harry didn’t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and \\nthat was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. \\nMalfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him \\nto enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \\n\\n“I don’t think Potter liked your valentine much!” \\n\\nGinny covered her face with her hands and ran into \\nclass. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but \\nHarry pulled him away. Ron didn’t need to spend the \\nwhole of Charms belching slugs. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 266 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt wasn’t until they had reached Professor Flitwick’s \\nclass that Harry noticed something rather odd about \\nRiddle’s diary. All his other books were drenched in \\nscarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had \\nbeen before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He \\ntried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having \\ntrouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles \\nwere blossoming out of the end, and he wasn’t much \\ninterested in anything else. \\n\\n\\n\\nJc Jc Jc \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry went to bed before anyone else in his \\ndormitory that night. This was partly because he \\ndidn’t think he could stand Fred and George singing, \\n“His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one \\nmore time, and partly because he wanted to examine \\nRiddle’s diary again, and knew that Ron thought he \\nwas wasting his time. \\n\\nHarry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the \\nblank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet \\nink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his \\nbedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped \\na blot onto the first page of the diary. \\n\\nThe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and \\nthen, as though it was being sucked into the page, \\nvanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second \\ntime and wrote, “My name is Harry Potter.” \\n\\nThe words shone momentarily on the page and they, \\ntoo, sank without trace. Then, at last, something \\nhappened. \\n\\nOozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, \\ncame words Harry had never written. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 267 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did \\nyou come by my diary?” \\n\\nThese words, too, faded away, but not before Harry \\nhad started to scribble back. \\n\\n“Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.” \\n\\nHe waited eagerly for Riddle’s reply. \\n\\n“Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more \\nlasting way than ink. But I always knew that there \\nwould be those who would not want this diary read.” \\n\\n“What do you mean?” Harry scrawled, blotting the \\npage in his excitement. \\n\\n“I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible \\nthings. Things that were covered up. Things that \\nhappened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and \\nWizardry.” \\n\\n“That’s where I am now,” Harry wrote quickly. “I’m at \\nHogwarts, and horrible stuff’s been happening. Do \\nyou know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?” \\n\\nHis heart was hammering. Riddle’s reply came \\nquickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he \\nwas hurrying to tell all he knew. \\n\\n“Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my \\nday, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. \\nBut this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was \\nopened and the monster attacked several students, \\nfinally killing one. I caught the person who’d opened \\nthe Chamber and he was expelled. But the \\nheadmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a \\nthing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell \\nthe truth. A story was given out that the girl had died \\nPage | 268 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin a freak accident They gave me a nice, shiny, \\nengraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep \\nmy mouth shut But I knew it could happen again. The \\nmonster lived on, and the one who had the power to \\nrelease it was not imprisoned.” \\n\\nHarry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write \\nback. \\n\\n“It’s happening again now. There have been three \\nattacks and no one seems to know who’s behind \\nthem. Who was it last time?” \\n\\n“ I can show you, if you like,” came Riddle’s reply. “You \\ndon’t have to take my word for it. I can take you inside \\nmy memory of the night when I caught him.” \\n\\nHarry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. \\nWhat did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside \\nsomebody else’s memory? He glanced nervously at the \\ndoor to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When \\nhe looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words \\nforming. \\n\\n“Let me show you.” \\n\\nHarry paused for a fraction of a second and then \\nwrote two letters. \\n\\n“OK.” \\n\\nThe pages of the diary began to blow as though \\ncaught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the \\nmonth of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that \\nthe little square for June thirteenth seemed to have \\nturned into a minuscule television screen. His hands \\ntrembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye \\nagainst the little window, and before he knew what \\nwas happening, he was tilting forward; the window \\nPage | 269 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he \\nwas pitched headfirst through the opening in the \\npage, into a whirl of color and shadow. \\n\\nHe felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, \\nas the blurred shapes around him came suddenly \\ninto focus. \\n\\nHe knew immediately where he was. This circular \\nroom with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore’s \\noffice — but it wasn’t Dumbledore who was sitting \\nbehind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald \\nexcept for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a \\nletter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man \\nbefore. \\n\\n“I’m sorry,” he said shakily. “I didn’t mean to butt in \\n\\n\\n\\nBut the wizard didn’t look up. He continued to read, \\nfrowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and \\nstammered, “Er — I’ll just go, shall I?” \\n\\nStill the wizard ignored him. He didn’t seem even to \\nhave heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be \\ndeaf, Harry raised his voice. \\n\\n“Sorry I disturbed you. I’ll go now,” he half-shouted. \\n\\nThe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, \\nwalked past Harry without glancing at him, and went \\nto draw the curtains at his window. \\n\\nThe sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed \\nto be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat \\ndown, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door. \\n\\nHarry looked around the office. No Fawkes the \\nphoenix — no whirring silver contraptions. This was \\n\\nPage | 270 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this \\nunknown wizard was headmaster, not Dumbledore, \\nand he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, \\ncompletely invisible to the people of fifty years ago. \\n\\nThere was a knock on the office door. \\n\\n“Enter,” said the old wizard in a feeble voice. \\n\\nA boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed \\nhat. A silver prefect’s badge was glinting on his chest. \\nHe was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet- \\nblack hair. \\n\\n“Ah, Riddle,” said the headmaster. \\n\\n“You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?” said \\nRiddle. He looked nervous. \\n\\n“Sit down,” said Dippet. “I’ve just been reading the \\nletter you sent me.” \\n\\n“Oh,” said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands \\ntogether very tightly. \\n\\n“My dear boy,” said Dippet kindly, “I cannot possibly \\nlet you stay at school over the summer. Surely you \\nwant to go home for the holidays?” \\n\\n“No,” said Riddle at once. “I’d much rather stay at \\nHogwarts than go back to that — to that — ” \\n\\n“You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I \\nbelieve?” said Dippet curiously. \\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Riddle, reddening slightly. \\n\\n“You are Muggle-born?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 271 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Half-blood, sir,” said Riddle. “Muggle father, witch \\nmother.” \\n\\n“And are both your parents — ?” \\n\\n“My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told \\nme at the orphanage she lived just long enough to \\nname me — Tom after my father, Marvolo after my \\ngrandfather.” \\n\\nDippet clucked his tongue sympathetically. \\n\\n“The thing is, Tom,” he sighed, “special arrangements \\nmight have been made for you, but in the current \\ncircumstances. ...” \\n\\n“You mean all these attacks, sir?” said Riddle, and \\nHarry’s heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of \\nmissing anything. \\n\\n“Precisely,” said the headmaster. “My dear boy, you \\nmust see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to \\nremain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in \\nlight of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor \\nlittle girl. ... You will be safer by far at your \\norphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic \\nis even now talking about closing the school. We are \\nno nearer locating the — er — source of all this \\nunpleasantness. ...” \\n\\nRiddle’s eyes had widened. \\n\\n“Sir — if the person was caught — if it all stopped — ” \\n\\n“What do you mean?” said Dippet with a squeak in \\nhis voice, sitting up in his chair. “Riddle, do you mean \\nyou know something about these attacks?” \\n\\n“No, sir,” said Riddle quickly. \\n\\nPage | 272 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Harry was sure it was the same sort of “no” that \\nhe himself had given Dumbledore. \\n\\nDippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. \\n\\n“You may go, Tom. ...” \\n\\nRiddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. \\nHarry followed him. \\n\\nDown the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging \\nnext to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle \\nstopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could \\ntell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He \\nwas biting his lip, his forehead furrowed. \\n\\nThen, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, \\nhe hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. \\nThey didn’t see another person until they reached the \\nentrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping \\nauburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the \\nmarble staircase. \\n\\n“What are you doing, wandering around this late, \\nTom?” \\n\\nHarry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a \\nfifty-year-younger Dumbledore. \\n\\n“I had to see the headmaster, sir,” said Riddle. \\n\\n“Well, hurry off to bed,” said Dumbledore, giving \\nRiddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry \\nknew so well. “Best not to roam the corridors these \\ndays. Not since ...” \\n\\nHe sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode \\noff. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 273 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmoving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps \\nto the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit. \\n\\nBut to Harry’s disappointment, Riddle led him not \\ninto a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to \\nthe very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with \\nSnape. The torches hadn’t been lit, and when Riddle \\npushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just \\nsee him, standing stock-still by the door, watching \\nthe passage outside. \\n\\nIt felt to Harry that they were there for at least an \\nhour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the \\ndoor, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. \\nAnd just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant \\nand tense and started wishing he could return to the \\npresent, he heard something move beyond the door. \\n\\nSomeone was creeping along the passage. He heard \\nwhoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle \\nwere hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged \\nthrough the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind \\nhim, forgetting that he couldn’t be heard. \\n\\nFor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, \\nuntil Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in \\nthe direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak \\nopen, and then someone speaking in a hoarse \\nwhisper. \\n\\n“C’mon ... gotta get yeh outta here. ... C’mon now ... \\nin the box ...” \\n\\nThere was something familiar about that voice. ... \\n\\nRiddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry \\nstepped out behind him. He could see the dark \\noutline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of \\nan open door, a very large box next to it. \\n\\nPage | 274 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ ’Evening, Rubeus,” said Riddle sharply. \\n\\nThe boy slammed the door shut and stood up. \\n\\n“What yer doin’ down here, Tom?” \\n\\nRiddle stepped closer. \\n\\n“It’s all over,” he said. “I’m going to have to turn you \\nin, Rubeus. They’re talking about closing Hogwarts if \\nthe attacks don’t stop.” \\n\\n“What d’yeh — ” \\n\\n“I don’t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters \\ndon’t make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for \\nexercise and — ” \\n\\n“It never killed no one!” said the large boy, backing \\nagainst the closed door. From behind him, Harry \\ncould hear a funny rustling and clicking. \\n\\n“Come on, Rubeus,” said Riddle, moving yet closer. \\n“The dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The \\nleast Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing \\nthat killed their daughter is slaughtered. ...” \\n\\n“It wasn’t him!” roared the boy, his voice echoing in \\nthe dark passage. “He wouldn’! He never!” \\n\\n“Stand aside,” said Riddle, drawing out his wand. \\n\\nHis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. \\nThe door behind the large boy flew open with such \\nforce it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of \\nit came something that made Harry let out a long, \\npiercing scream unheard by anyone — \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 275 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black \\nlegs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp \\npincers — Riddle raised his wand again, but he was \\ntoo late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled \\naway, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle \\nscrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his \\nwand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his \\nwand, and threw him back down, yelling, \\n“NOOOOOOO!” \\n\\nThe scene whirled, the darkness became complete; \\nHarry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed \\nspread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor \\ndormitory, Riddle’s diary lying open on his stomach. \\n\\nBefore he had had time to regain his breath, the \\ndormitory door opened and Ron came in. \\n\\n“There you are,” he said. \\n\\nHarry sat up. He was sweating and shaking. \\n\\n“What’s up?” said Ron, looking at him with concern. \\n\\n“It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of \\nSecrets fifty years ago.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 276 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCORNELIUS FUDGE \\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that \\nHagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and \\nmonstrous creatures. During their first year at \\nHogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little \\nwooden house, and it would be a long time before \\nthey forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d \\nchristened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard \\nthat a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, \\nHarry was sure he’d have gone to any lengths for a \\nglimpse of it. He’d probably thought it was a shame \\nthat the monster had been cooped up so long, and \\nthought it deserved the chance to stretch its many \\nlegs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old \\nHagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he \\nwas equally certain that Hagrid would never have \\nmeant to kill anybody. \\n\\nHarry half wished he hadn’t found out how to work \\nRiddle’s diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione \\nmade him recount what he’d seen, until he was \\nheartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, \\ncircular conversations that followed. \\n\\nPage | 277 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“Riddle might have got the wrong person,” said \\nHermione. “Maybe it was some other monster that \\nwas attacking people. ...” \\n\\n“How many monsters d’you think this place can \\nhold?” Ron asked dully. \\n\\n“We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,” said \\nHarry miserably. “And the attacks must’ve stopped \\nafter Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle \\nwouldn’t have got his award.” \\n\\nRon tried a different tack. \\n\\n“Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to \\nsqueal on Hagrid, anyway?” \\n\\n“But the monster had killed someone, Ron,” said \\nHermione. \\n\\n“And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle \\norphanage if they closed Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I \\ndon’t blame him for wanting to stay here. ...” \\n\\n“You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you, \\nHarry?” \\n\\n“He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said \\nHarry quickly. \\n\\nThe three of them fell silent. After a long pause, \\nHermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a \\nhesitant voice. \\n\\n“Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it \\nall?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 278 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’d be a cheerful visit,” said Ron. “ ‘Hello, Hagrid. \\nTell us, have you been setting anything mad and \\nhairy loose in the castle lately?’ ” \\n\\nIn the end, they decided that they would not say \\nanything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, \\nand as more and more days went by with no whisper \\nfrom the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that \\nthey would never need to talk to him about why he \\nhad been expelled. It was now nearly four months \\nsince Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been \\nPetrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that \\nthe attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. \\nPeeves had finally got bored of his “Oh, Potter, you \\nrotter” song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite \\npolitely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in \\nHerbology one day, and in March several of the \\nMandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in \\ngreenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very \\nhappy. \\n\\n“The moment they start trying to move into each \\nother’s pots, we’ll know they’re fully mature,” she told \\nHarry. “Then we’ll be able to revive those poor people \\nin the hospital wing.” \\n\\nThe second years were given something new to think \\nabout during their Easter holidays. The time had \\ncome to choose their subjects for the third year, a \\nmatter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously. \\n\\n“It could affect our whole future,” she told Harry and \\nRon as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking \\nthem with checks. \\n\\n“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 279 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We can’t,” said Ron gloomily. “We keep all our old \\nsubjects, or I’d’ve ditched Defense Against the Dark \\nArts.” \\n\\n“But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked. \\n\\n“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t \\nlearned anything from him except not to set pixies \\nloose.” \\n\\nNeville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the \\nwitches and wizards in his family, all giving him \\ndifferent advice on what to choose. Confused and \\nworried, he sat reading the subject lists with his \\ntongue poking out, asking people whether they \\nthought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the \\nstudy of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like \\nHarry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing \\nhis eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking \\nthe subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody’s \\nadvice but signed up for everything. \\n\\nHarry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what \\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried \\nto discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that \\nhe didn’t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager \\nto share his experience. \\n\\n“Depends where you want to go, Harry,” he said. “It’s \\nnever too early to think about the future, so I’d \\nrecommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is \\na soft option, but I personally think wizards should \\nhave a thorough understanding of the non-magical \\ncommunity, particularly if they’re thinking of working \\nin close contact with them — look at my father, he \\nhas to deal with Muggle business all the time. My \\nbrother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, \\nso he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your \\nstrengths, Harry.” \\n\\nPage | 280 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the only thing Harry felt he was really good at \\nwas Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new \\nsubjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, \\nat least he’d have someone friendly to help him. \\n\\nGryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against \\nHufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices \\nevery night after dinner, so that Harry barely had \\ntime for anything but Quidditch and homework. \\nHowever, the training sessions were getting better, or \\nat least drier, and the evening before Saturday’s \\nmatch he went up to his dormitory to drop off his \\nbroomstick feeling Gryffindor’s chances for the \\nQuidditch Cup had never been better. \\n\\nBut his cheerful mood didn’t last long. At the top of \\nthe stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville \\nLongbottom, who was looking frantic. \\n\\n“Harry — I don’t know who did it — I just found — ” \\n\\nWatching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the \\ndoor. \\n\\nThe contents of Harry’s trunk had been thrown \\neverywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The \\nbedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the \\ndrawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, \\nthe contents strewn over the mattress. \\n\\nHarry walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading \\non a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and \\nNeville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, \\nDean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly. \\n\\n“What happened, Harry?” \\n\\n“No idea,” said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry’s \\nrobes. All the pockets were hanging out. \\n\\nPage | 281 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Someone’s been looking for something,” said Ron. “Is \\nthere anything missing?” \\n\\nHarry started to pick up all his things and throw \\nthem into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last \\nof the Lockhart books back into it that he realized \\nwhat wasn’t there. \\n\\n“Riddle’s diary’s gone,” he said in an undertone to \\nRon. \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\nHarry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and \\nRon followed him out. They hurried down to the \\nGryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and \\njoined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a \\nbook called Ancient Runes Made Easy. \\n\\nHermione looked aghast at the news. \\n\\n“But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody \\nelse knows our password — ” \\n\\n“Exactly,” said Harry. \\n\\nThey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a \\nlight, refreshing breeze. \\n\\n“Perfect Quidditch conditions!” said Wood \\nenthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the \\nteam’s plates with scrambled eggs. “Harry, buck up \\nthere, you need a decent breakfast.” \\n\\nHarry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor \\ntable, wondering if the new owner of Riddle’s diary \\nwas right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been \\nurging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn’t like \\nthe idea. He’d have to tell a teacher all about the \\nPage | 282 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndiary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had \\nbeen expelled fifty years ago? He didn’t want to be the \\none who brought it all up again. \\n\\nAs he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go \\nand collect his Quidditch things, another very serious \\nworry was added to Harry’s growing list. He had just \\nset foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet \\nagain — \\n\\n“ Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear ...” \\n\\nHe shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both \\njumped away from him in alarm. \\n\\n“The voice!” said Harry, looking over his shoulder. “I \\njust heard it again — didn’t you?” \\n\\nRon shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, \\nclapped a hand to her forehead. \\n\\n“Harry — I think I’ve just understood something! I’ve \\ngot to go to the library!” \\n\\nAnd she sprinted away, up the stairs. \\n\\n“ What does she understand?” said Harry distractedly, \\nstill looking around, trying to tell where the voice had \\ncome from. \\n\\n“Loads more than I do,” said Ron, shaking his head. \\n\\n“But why’s she got to go to the library?” \\n\\n“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, \\nshrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.” \\n\\nHarry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice \\nagain, but people were now emerging from the Great \\n\\nPage | 283 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the \\nfront doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch. \\n\\n\\n\\n“You’d better get moving,” said Ron. “It’s nearly eleven \\n— the match — ” \\n\\nHarry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his \\nNimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd \\nswarming across the grounds, but his mind was still \\nin the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he \\npulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his \\nonly comfort was that everyone was now outside to \\nwatch the game. \\n\\nThe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous \\napplause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight \\naround the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the \\nballs. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, \\nwere standing in a huddle, having a last-minute \\ndiscussion of tactics. \\n\\nHarry was just mounting his broom when Professor \\nMcGonagall came half marching, half running across \\nthe pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone. \\n\\nHarry’s heart dropped like a stone. \\n\\n“This match has been canceled,” Professor \\nMcGonagall called through the megaphone, \\naddressing the packed stadium. There were boos and \\nshouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and \\nran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off \\nhis broomstick. \\n\\n“But, Professor!” he shouted. “We’ve got to play — the \\nCup — Gryffindor — ” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall ignored him and continued to \\nshout through her megaphone: \\n\\nPage | 284 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“All students are to make their way back to the House \\ncommon rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give \\nthem further information. As quickly as you can, \\nplease!” \\n\\nThen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned \\nHarry over to her. \\n\\n“Potter, I think you’d better come with me. ...” \\n\\nWondering how she could possibly suspect him this \\ntime, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the \\ncomplaining crowd; he came running up to them as \\nthey set off toward the castle. To Harry’s surprise, \\nProfessor McGonagall didn’t object. \\n\\n“Yes, perhaps you’d better come, too, Weasley. ...” \\n\\nSome of the students swarming around them were \\ngrumbling about the match being canceled; others \\nlooked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor \\nMcGonagall back into the school and up the marble \\nstaircase. But they weren’t taken to anybody’s office \\nthis time. \\n\\n“This will be a bit of a shock,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they \\napproached the infirmary. “There has been another \\nattack ... another double attack.” \\n\\nHarry’s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor \\nMcGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron \\nentered. \\n\\nMadam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth-year girl \\nwith long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the \\nRavenclaw they’d accidentally asked for directions to \\nthe Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to \\nher was — \\n\\nPage | 285 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“HermioneY’ Ron groaned. \\n\\nHermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy. \\n\\n“They were found near the library,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall. “I don’t suppose either of you can \\nexplain this? It was on the floor next to them. ...” \\n\\nShe was holding up a small, circular mirror. \\n\\nHarry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at \\nHermione. \\n\\n“I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said \\nProfessor McGonagall heavily. “I need to address the \\nstudents in any case.” \\n\\n“All students will return to their House common \\nrooms by six o’clock in the evening. No student is to \\nleave the dormitories after that time. You will be \\nescorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to \\nuse the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All \\nfurther Quidditch training and matches are to be \\npostponed. There will be no more evening activities.” \\n\\nThe Gryffindors packed inside the common room \\nlistened to Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled \\nup the parchment from which she had been reading \\nand said in a somewhat choked voice, “I need hardly \\nadd that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely \\nthat the school will be closed unless the culprit \\nbehind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone \\nwho thinks they might know anything about them to \\ncome forward.” \\n\\nShe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait \\nhole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 286 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s two Gryffindors down, not counting a \\nGryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,” \\nsaid the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan, counting \\non his fingers. “Haven’t any of the teachers noticed \\nthat the Slytherins are all safe? Isn’t it obvious all this \\nstuff’s coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, \\nthe monster of Slytherin — why don’t they just chuck \\nall the Slytherins out?” he roared, to nods and \\nscattered applause. \\n\\nPercy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but \\nfor once he didn’t seem keen to make his views heard. \\nHe was looking pale and stunned. \\n\\n“Percy’s in shock,” George told Harry quietly. “That \\nRavenclaw girl — Penelope Clearwater — she’s a \\nprefect. I don’t think he thought the monster would \\ndare attack a prefect.” \\n\\nBut Harry was only half-listening. He didn’t seem to \\nbe able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on \\nthe hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if \\nthe culprit wasn’t caught soon, he was looking at a \\nlifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had \\nturned Hagrid in because he was faced with the \\nprospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. \\nHarry now knew exactly how he had felt. \\n\\n“What’re we going to do?” said Ron quietly in Harry’s \\near. “D’you think they suspect Hagrid?” \\n\\n“We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said Harry, making \\nup his mind. “I can’t believe it’s him this time, but if \\nhe set the monster loose last time he’ll know how to \\nget inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.” \\n\\n“But McGonagall said we’ve got to stay in our tower \\nunless we’re in class — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 287 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think,” said Harry, more quietly still, “it’s time to \\nget my dad’s old cloak out again.” \\n\\nHarry had inherited just one thing from his father: a \\nlong and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only \\nchance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid \\nwithout anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at \\nthe usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and \\nSeamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of \\nSecrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed \\nagain, and threw the cloak over themselves. \\n\\nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle \\ncorridors wasn’t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered \\nthe castle at night several times before, had never \\nseen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects, \\nand ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, \\nstaring around for any unusual activity. Their \\nInvisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any noise, \\nand there was a particularly tense moment when Ron \\nstubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape \\nstood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at \\nalmost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with \\nrelief that they reached the oak front doors and eased \\nthem open. \\n\\nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the \\nlit windows of Hagrid ’s house and pulled off the cloak \\nonly when they were right outside his front door. \\n\\nSeconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. \\nThey found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a \\ncrossbow at them. Fang the boarhound barked loudly \\nbehind him. \\n\\n“Oh,” he said, lowering the weapon and staring at \\nthem. “What ’re you two doin’ here?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 288 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s that for?” said Harry, pointing at the \\ncrossbow as they stepped inside. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothin’ — nothin’ — “ Hagrid muttered. “I’ve bin \\nexpectin’ — doesn’ matter — Sit down — I’ll make tea \\n\\n\\n\\nHe hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He \\nnearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the \\nkettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a \\nnervous jerk of his massive hand. \\n\\n“Are you okay, Hagrid?” said Harry. “Did you hear \\nabout Hermione?” \\n\\n“Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said Hagrid, a slight break in \\nhis voice. \\n\\nHe kept glancing nervously at the windows. He \\npoured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had \\nforgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab \\nof fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock \\non the door. \\n\\nHagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron \\nexchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the \\nInvisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated \\ninto a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden, \\nseized his crossbow, and flung open his door once \\nmore. \\n\\n“Good evening, Hagrid.” \\n\\nIt was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly \\nserious, and was followed by a second, very odd- \\nlooking man. \\n\\nThe stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious \\nexpression, and was wearing a strange mixture of \\n\\nPage | 289 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black \\ncloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he \\ncarried a lime-green bowler. \\n\\n“That’s Dad’s boss!” Ron breathed. “Cornelius Fudge, \\nthe Minister of Magic!” \\n\\nHarry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up. \\n\\nHagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into \\none of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to \\nCornelius Fudge. \\n\\n“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fudge in rather clipped \\ntones. “Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks \\non Muggle-borns. Things’ve gone far enough. \\nMinistry’s got to act.” \\n\\n“I never,” said Hagrid, looking imploringly at \\nDumbledore. “You know I never, Professor \\nDumbledore, sir — ” \\n\\n“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my \\nfull confidence,” said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge. \\n\\n“Look, Albus,” said Fudge, uncomfortably. “Hagrid’s \\nrecord’s against him. Ministry’s got to do something \\n— the school governors have been in touch — ” \\n\\n“Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid \\naway will not help in the slightest,” said Dumbledore. \\nHis blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen \\nbefore. \\n\\n“Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge, \\nfidgeting with his bowler. “I’m under a lot of pressure. \\nGot to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it \\nwasn’t Hagrid, he’ll be back and no more said. But \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 290 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn’t be doing my \\nduty — ” \\n\\n“Take me?” said Hagrid, who was trembling. “Take me \\nwhere?” \\n\\n“For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting \\nHagrid ’s eyes. “Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a \\nprecaution. If someone else is caught, you’ll be let out \\nwith a full apology — ” \\n\\n“Not Azkaban?” croaked Hagrid. \\n\\nBefore Fudge could answer, there was another loud \\nrap on the door. \\n\\nDumbledore answered it. It was Harry’s turn for an \\nelbow in the ribs; he’d let out an audible gasp. \\n\\nMr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid’s hut, swathed \\nin a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and \\nsatisfied smile. Fang started to growl. \\n\\n“Already here, Fudge,” he said approvingly. “Good, \\ngood...” \\n\\n“What’re you doin’ here?” said Hagrid furiously. “Get \\noutta my house!” \\n\\n“My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure \\nat all in being inside your — er — d’you call this a \\nhouse?” said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked \\naround the small cabin. “I simply called at the school \\nand was told that the headmaster was here.” \\n\\n“And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?” \\nsaid Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was \\nstill blazing in his blue eyes. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 291 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,” said Malfoy lazily, \\ntaking out a long roll of parchment, “but the \\ngovernors feel it’s time for you to step aside. This is \\nan Order of Suspension — you’ll find all twelve \\nsignatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’re losing your \\ntouch. How many attacks have there been now? Two \\nmore this afternoon, wasn’t it? At this rate, there’ll be \\nno Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know \\nwhat an awful loss that would be to the school.” \\n\\n“Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Fudge, looking \\nalarmed, “Dumbledore suspended — no, no — last \\nthing we want just now — ” \\n\\n“The appointment — or suspension — of the \\nheadmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,” \\nsaid Mr. Malfoy smoothly. “And as Dumbledore has \\nfailed to stop these attacks — ” \\n\\n“See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can’t stop them,” \\nsaid Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, “I \\nmean to say, who can?” \\n\\n“That remains to be seen,” said Mr. Malfoy with a \\nnasty smile. “But as all twelve of us have voted — ” \\n\\nHagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing \\nthe ceiling. \\n\\n“An’ how many did yeh have ter threaten an’ \\nblackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?” he roared. \\n\\n“Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead \\nyou into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,” said Mr. \\nMalfoy. “I would advise you not to shout at the \\nAzkaban guards like that. They won’t like it at all.” \\n\\n“Yeh can’ take Dumbledore!” yelled Hagrid, making \\nFang the boarhound cower and whimper in his \\n\\nPage | 292 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbasket. “Take him away, an’ the Muggle-borns won’ \\nstand a chance! There’ll be killin’ next!” \\n\\n“Calm yourself, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore sharply. He \\nlooked at Lucius Malfoy. \\n\\n“If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of \\ncourse step aside — ” \\n\\n“But — ” stuttered Fudge. \\n\\n“iVo!” growled Hagrid. \\n\\nDumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off \\nLucius Malfoy’s cold gray ones. \\n\\n“However,” said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly \\nand clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \\n“you will find that I will only truly have left this school \\nwhen none here are loyal to me. You will also find \\nthat help will always be given at Hogwarts to those \\nwho ask for it.” \\n\\nFor a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore’s \\neyes flickered toward the corner where he and Ron \\nstood hidden. \\n\\n“Admirable sentiments,” said Malfoy, bowing. “We \\nshall all miss your — er — highly individual way of \\nrunning things, Albus, and only hope that your \\nsuccessor will manage to prevent any — ah — killins.” \\n\\nHe strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed \\nDumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, \\nwaited for Hagrid to go ahead of him, but Hagrid \\nstood his ground, took a deep breath, and said \\ncarefully, “If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, \\nall they’d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders. \\nThat’d lead ’em right! That’s all I’m sayin’.” \\n\\nPage | 293 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFudge stared at him in amazement. \\n\\n\\n\\n“All right, I’m cornin’,” said Hagrid, pulling on his \\nmoleskin overcoat. But as he was about to follow \\nFudge through the door, he stopped again and said \\nloudly, “An’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang while I’m \\naway.” \\n\\nThe door banged shut and Ron pulled off the \\nInvisibility Cloak. \\n\\n“We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely. “No \\nDumbledore. They might as well close the school \\ntonight. There’ll be an attack a day with him gone.” \\n\\nFang started howling, scratching at the closed door. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 294 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARAGOG \\n\\nSummer was creeping over the grounds around the \\ncastle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and \\nflowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the \\ngreenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the \\ncastle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his \\nheels, the scene didn’t look right to Harry; no better, \\nin fact, than the inside of the castle, where things \\nwere so horribly wrong. \\n\\nHarry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but \\nvisitors were now barred from the hospital wing. \\n\\n“We’re taking no more chances,” Madam Pomfrey told \\nthem severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \\n“No, I’m sorry, there’s every chance the attacker might \\ncome back to finish these people off. ...” \\n\\nWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never \\nbefore, so that the sun warming the castle walls \\noutside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. \\nThere was barely a face to be seen in the school that \\ndidn’t look worried and tense, and any laughter that \\n\\nPage | 295 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nrang through the corridors sounded shrill and \\nunnatural and was quickly stifled. \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry constantly repeated Dumbledore’s final words \\nto himself. “I will only truly have left this school when \\nnone here are loyal to me. . . . Help will always be given \\nat Hog warts to those who ask for it.” But what good \\nwere these words? Who exactly were they supposed to \\nask for help, when everyone was just as confused and \\nscared as they were? \\n\\nHagrid’s hint about the spiders was far easier to \\nunderstand — the trouble was, there didn’t seem to \\nbe a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry \\nlooked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) \\nby Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact \\nthat they weren’t allowed to wander off on their own \\nbut had to move around the castle in a pack with the \\nother Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students \\nseemed glad that they were being shepherded from \\nclass to class by teachers, but Harry found it very \\nirksome. \\n\\nOne person, however, seemed to be thoroughly \\nenjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. \\n\\nDraco Malfoy was strutting around the school as \\nthough he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry \\ndidn’t realize what he was so pleased about until the \\nPotions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and \\nHagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, \\nHarry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle. \\n\\n“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid \\nof Dumbledore,” he said, not troubling to keep his \\nvoice down. “I told you he thinks Dumbledore’s the \\nworst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll \\nget a decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t \\nwant the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall \\nwon’t last long, she’s only filling in. ...” \\n\\nPage | 296 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnape swept past Harry, making no comment about \\nHermione’s empty seat and cauldron. \\n\\n“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t you apply for \\nthe headmaster’s job?” \\n\\n“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t \\nsuppress a thin-lipped smile. “Professor Dumbledore \\nhas only been suspended by the governors. I daresay \\nhe’ll be back with us soon enough.” \\n\\n“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d \\nhave Father’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the \\njob — I’ll tell Father you’re the best teacher here, sir \\n\\n\\n\\nSnape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, \\nfortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was \\npretending to vomit into his cauldron. \\n\\n“I’m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven’t all packed \\ntheir bags by now,” Malfoy went on. “Bet you five \\nGalleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn’t Granger — ” \\n\\nThe bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at \\nMalfoy’s last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in \\nthe scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts \\nto reach Malfoy went unnoticed. \\n\\n“Let me at him,” Ron growled as Harry and Dean \\nhung onto his arms. “I don’t care, I don’t need my \\nwand, I’m going to kill him with my bare hands — ” \\n\\n“Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,” \\nbarked Snape over the class’s heads, and off they \\nmarched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the \\nrear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only safe to \\nlet go of him when Snape had seen them out of the \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 297 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncastle and they were making their way across the \\nvegetable patch toward the greenhouses. \\n\\nThe Herbology class was very subdued; there were \\nnow two missing from their number, Justin and \\nHermione. \\n\\nProfessor Sprout set them all to work pruning the \\nAbyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of \\nwithered stalks onto the compost heap and found \\nhimself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took \\na deep breath and said, very formally, “I just want to \\nsay, Harry, that I’m sorry I ever suspected you. I \\nknow you’d never attack Hermione Granger, and I \\napologize for all the stuff I said. We’re all in the same \\nboat now, and, well — ” \\n\\nHe held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it. \\n\\nErnie and his friend Hannah came to work at the \\nsame Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron. \\n\\n“That Draco Malfoy character,” said Ernie, breaking \\noff dead twigs, “he seems very pleased about all this, \\ndoesn’t he? D’you know, I think he might be \\nSlytherin’s heir.” \\n\\n“That’s clever of you,” said Ron, who didn’t seem to \\nhave forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry. \\n\\n“Do you think it’s Malfoy, Harry?” Ernie asked. \\n\\n“No,” said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah \\nstared. \\n\\nA second later, Harry spotted something. \\n\\nSeveral large spiders were scuttling over the ground \\non the other side of the glass, moving in an \\n\\nPage | 298 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunnaturally straight line as though taking the \\nshortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit \\nRon over the hand with his pruning shears. \\n\\n“Ouch\\\\ What ’re you — ” \\n\\nHarry pointed out the spiders, following their progress \\nwith his eyes screwed up against the sun. \\n\\n“Oh, yeah,” said Ron, trying, and failing, to look \\npleased. “But we can’t follow them now — ” \\n\\nErnie and Hannah were listening curiously. \\n\\nHarry’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If \\nthey pursued their fixed course, there could be no \\ndoubt about where they would end up. \\n\\n“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Ron looked even unhappier about that. \\n\\nAt the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the \\nclass to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. \\nHarry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could \\ntalk out of earshot. \\n\\n“Well have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” Harry \\ntold Ron. “We can take Fang with us. He’s used to \\ngoing into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some \\nhelp.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Ron, who was twirling his wand \\nnervously in his fingers. “Er — aren’t there — aren’t \\nthere supposed to be werewolves in the forest?” he \\nadded as they took their usual places at the back of \\nLockhart’s classroom. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 299 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \\n“There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are \\nall right, and the unicorns ...” \\n\\nRon had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. \\nHarry had entered it only once and had hoped never \\nto do so again. \\n\\nLockhart bounded into the room and the class stared \\nat him. Every other teacher in the place was looking \\ngrimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing \\nshort of buoyant. \\n\\n“Come now,” he cried, beaming around him. “Why all \\nthese long faces?” \\n\\nPeople swapped exasperated looks, but nobody \\nanswered. \\n\\n“Don’t you people realize,” said Lockhart, speaking \\nslowly, as though they were all a bit dim, “the danger \\nhas passed! The culprit has been taken away — ” \\n\\n“Says who?” said Dean Thomas loudly. \\n\\n“My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn’t \\nhave taken Hagrid if he hadn’t been one hundred \\npercent sure that he was guilty,” said Lockhart, in the \\ntone of someone explaining that one and one made \\ntwo. \\n\\n“Oh, yes he would,” said Ron, even more loudly than \\nDean. \\n\\n“I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid ’s \\narrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,” said Lockhart in a \\nself-satisfied tone. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 300 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow, \\nbut stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him \\nhard under the desk. \\n\\n\\n\\n“We weren’t there, remember?” Harry muttered. \\n\\nBut Lockhart’s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that \\nhe had always thought Hagrid was no good, his \\nconfidence that the whole business was now at an \\nend, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw \\nGadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart’s stupid face. \\nInstead he contented himself with scrawling a note to \\nRon: Let’s do it tonight \\n\\nRon read the message, swallowed hard, and looked \\nsideways at the empty seat usually filled by \\nHermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and \\nhe nodded. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Gryffindor common room was always very \\ncrowded these days, because from six o’clock onward \\nthe Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had \\nplenty to talk about, with the result that the common \\nroom often didn’t empty until past midnight. \\n\\nHarry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his \\ntrunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting \\non it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George \\nchallenged Harry and Ron to a few games of \\nExploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very \\nsubdued in Hermione ’s usual chair. Harry and Ron \\nkept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games \\nquickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when \\nFred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. \\n\\nHarry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two \\ndormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, \\n\\nPage | 301 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthrowing it over themselves, and climbing through the \\nportrait hole. \\n\\nIt was another difficult journey through the castle, \\ndodging all the teachers. At last they reached the \\nentrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front \\ndoors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any \\ncreaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds. \\n\\n“ ’Course,” said Ron abruptly as they strode across \\nthe black grass, “we might get to the forest and find \\nthere’s nothing to follow. Those spiders might not’ve \\nbeen going there at all. I know it looked like they were \\nmoving in that sort of general direction, but ...” \\n\\nHis voice trailed away hopefully. \\n\\nThey reached Hagrid’s house, sad and sorry-looking \\nwith its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door \\nopen, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. \\nWorried he might wake everyone at the castle with his \\ndeep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle \\ntoffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his \\nteeth together. \\n\\nHarry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid’s table. \\nThere would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. \\n\\n“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said Harry, \\npatting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the \\nhouse behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, \\nand lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree. \\n\\nHarry took out his wand, murmured, “Lumos\\\\” and a \\ntiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let \\nthem watch the path for signs of spiders. \\n\\n“Good thinking,” said Ron. “I’d light mine, too, but \\nyou know — it’d probably blow up or something. ...” \\n\\nPage | 302 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the \\ngrass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from \\nthe wandlight into the shade of the trees. \\n\\n“Okay,” Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \\n“I’m ready. Let’s go.” \\n\\nSo, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree \\nroots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow \\nof Harry’s wand, they followed the steady trickle of \\nspiders moving along the path. They walked behind \\nthem for about twenty minutes, not speaking, \\nlistening hard for noises other than breaking twigs \\nand rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become \\nthicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no \\nlonger visible, and Harry’s wand shone alone in the \\nsea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the \\npath. \\n\\nHarry paused, trying to see where the spiders were \\ngoing, but everything outside his little sphere of light \\nwas pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the \\nforest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid \\nadvising him not to leave the forest path last time \\nhe’d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, \\nprobably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also \\nsaid to follow the spiders. \\n\\nSomething wet touched Harry’s hand and he jumped \\nbackward, crushing Ron’s foot, but it was only Fang’s \\nnose. \\n\\n“What d’you reckon?” Harry said to Ron, whose eyes \\nhe could just make out, reflecting the light from his \\nwand. \\n\\n“We’ve come this far,” said Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 303 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo they followed the darting shadows of the spiders \\ninto the trees. They couldn’t move very quickly now; \\nthere were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely \\nvisible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang’s \\nhot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to \\nstop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the \\nspiders in the wandlight. \\n\\nThey walked for what seemed like at least half an \\nhour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and \\nbrambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground \\nseemed to be sloping downward, though the trees \\nwere as thick as ever. \\n\\nThen Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, \\nmaking both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins. \\n\\n“What?” said Ron loudly, looking around into the \\npitch-dark, and gripping Harry’s elbow very hard. \\n\\n“There’s something moving over there,” Harry \\nbreathed. “Listen ... sounds like something big. ...” \\n\\nThey listened. Some distance to their right, the \\nsomething big was snapping branches as it carved a \\npath through the trees. \\n\\n“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh — ” \\n\\n“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.” \\n\\n“Hear me?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \\n\\n“It’s already heard Fang!” \\n\\nThe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs \\nas they stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange \\nrumbling noise and then silence. \\n\\n“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry. \\n\\nPage | 304 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron. \\n\\nThey waited, shivering, hardly daring to move. \\n\\n“D’you think it’s gone?” Harry whispered. \\n\\n“Dunno — ” \\n\\nThen, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so \\nbright in the darkness that both of them flung up \\ntheir hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried \\nto run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped \\neven louder. \\n\\n“Harry!” Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief. \\n“Harry, it’s our car!” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“Come on!” \\n\\nHarry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling \\nand tripping, and a moment later they had emerged \\ninto a clearing. \\n\\nMr. Weasley’s car was standing, empty, in the middle \\nof a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense \\nbranches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, \\nopenmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, \\nexactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner. \\n\\n“It’s been here all the time!” said Ron delightedly, \\nwalking around the car. “Look at it. The forest’s \\nturned it wild. ...” \\n\\nThe sides of the car were scratched and smeared with \\nmud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the \\nforest on its own. Fang didn’t seem at all keen on it; \\nhe kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. \\n\\nPage | 305 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHis breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his \\nwand back into his robes. \\n\\n“And we thought it was going to attack us!” said Ron, \\nleaning against the car and patting it. “I wondered \\nwhere it had gone!” \\n\\nHarry squinted around on the floodlit ground for \\nsigns of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away \\nfrom the glare of the headlights. \\n\\n“We’ve lost the trail,” he said. “C’mon, let’s go and find \\nthem.” \\n\\nRon didn’t speak. He didn’t move. His eyes were fixed \\non a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right \\nbehind Harry. His face was livid with terror. \\n\\nHarry didn’t even have time to turn around. There \\nwas a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt \\nsomething long and hairy seize him around the \\nmiddle and lift him off the ground, so that he was \\nhanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard \\nmore clicking, and saw Ron’s legs leave the ground, \\ntoo, heard Fang whimpering and howling — next \\nmoment, he was being swept away into the dark \\ntrees. \\n\\nHead hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him \\nwas marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the \\nfront two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining \\nblack pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of \\nthe creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were \\nmoving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could \\nhear Fang fighting to free himself from a third \\nmonster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn’t have \\nyelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left \\nhis voice back with the car in the clearing. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 306 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe never knew how long he was in the creature’s \\nclutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly \\nlifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn \\nground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his \\nneck sideways, he realized that they had reached the \\nridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared \\nof trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the \\nworst scene he had ever laid eyes on. \\n\\nSpiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the \\nleaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight- \\neyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive \\nspecimen that was carrying Harry made its way down \\nthe steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very \\ncenter of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all \\naround it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight \\nof its load. \\n\\nHarry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider \\nreleased him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to \\nhim. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering \\nsilently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. \\nHis mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent \\nscream and his eyes were popping. \\n\\nHarry suddenly realized that the spider that had \\ndropped him was saying something. It had been hard \\nto tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word \\nhe spoke. \\n\\n“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!” \\n\\nAnd from the middle of the misty, domed web, a \\nspider the size of a small elephant emerged, very \\nslowly. There was gray in the black of his body and \\nlegs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head \\nwas milky white. He was blind. \\n\\n“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly. \\n\\nPage | 307 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight \\nmilky eyes wandering vaguely. \\n\\n“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron. \\n“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. \\n\\n\\n\\n“We’re friends of Hagrid ’s,” Harry shouted. His heart \\nseemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat. \\n\\nClick, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all \\naround the hollow. \\n\\nAragog paused. \\n\\n“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,” \\nhe said slowly. \\n\\n“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast. \\n“That’s why we’ve come.” \\n\\n“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought \\nhe heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. “But \\nwhy has he sent you?” \\n\\nHarry thought of getting to his feet but decided \\nagainst it; he didn’t think his legs would support him. \\nSo he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could. \\n\\n“They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been \\nsetting a — a — something on students. They’ve \\ntaken him to Azkaban.” \\n\\nAragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around \\nthe hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of \\n\\nPage | 308 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nspiders; it was like applause, except applause didn’t \\nusually make Harry feel sick with fear. \\n\\n“But that was years ago,” said Aragog fretfully. “Years \\nand years ago. I remember it well. That’s why they \\nmade him leave the school. They believed that I was \\nthe monster that dwells in what they call the \\nChamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had \\nopened the Chamber and set me free.” \\n\\n“And you ... you didn’t come from the Chamber of \\nSecrets?” said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his \\nforehead. \\n\\n“I!” said Aragog, clicking angrily. “I was not born in \\nthe castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave \\nme to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a \\nboy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the \\ncastle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is \\nmy good friend, and a good man. When I was \\ndiscovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he \\nprotected me. I have lived here in the forest ever \\nsince, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me \\na wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, \\nall through Hagrid ’s goodness. ...” \\n\\nHarry summoned what remained of his courage. \\n\\n“So you never — never attacked anyone?” \\n\\n“Never,” croaked the old spider. “It would have been \\nmy instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never \\nharmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed \\nwas discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of \\nthe castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our \\nkind like the dark and the quiet. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 309 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But then . . . Do you know what did kill that girl?” \\nsaid Harry. “Because whatever it is, it’s back and \\nattacking people again — ” \\n\\nHis words were drowned by a loud outbreak of \\nclicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting \\nangrily; large black shapes shifted all around him. \\n\\n“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an \\nancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well \\ndo I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, \\nwhen I sensed the beast moving about the school.” \\n\\n“What is it?” said Harry urgently. \\n\\nMore loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed \\nto be closing in. \\n\\n“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do \\nnot name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that \\ndread creature, though he asked me, many times.” \\n\\nHarry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the \\nspiders pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to \\nbe tired of talking. He was backing slowly into his \\ndomed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch \\nslowly toward Harry and Ron. \\n\\n“Well just go, then,” Harry called desperately to \\nAragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him. \\n\\n“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. ...” \\n\\n“But — but — ” \\n\\n“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my \\ncommand. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when \\nit wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, \\nfriend of Hagrid.” \\n\\nPage | 310 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, \\nwas a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes \\ngleaming in their ugly black heads. \\n\\nEven as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was \\nno good, there were too many of them, but as he tried \\nto stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note \\nsounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the \\nhollow. \\n\\nMr. Weasley’s car was thundering down the slope, \\nheadlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking \\nspiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, \\ntheir endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched \\nto a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew \\nopen. \\n\\n“Get Fang!” Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; \\n\\nRon seized the boarhound around the middle and \\nthrew him, yelping, into the back of the car — the \\ndoors slammed shut — Ron didn’t touch the \\naccelerator but the car didn’t need him; the engine \\nroared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They \\nsped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were \\nsoon crashing through the forest, branches whipping \\nthe windows as the car wound its way cleverly \\nthrough the widest gaps, following a path it obviously \\nknew. \\n\\nHarry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still \\nopen in the silent scream, but his eyes weren’t \\npopping anymore. \\n\\n“Are you okay?” \\n\\nRon stared straight ahead, unable to speak. \\n\\nThey smashed their way through the undergrowth, \\nFang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw \\n\\nPage | 311 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large \\noak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, \\nand Harry could again see patches of sky. \\n\\nThe car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly \\nthrown into the windshield. They had reached the \\nedge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in \\nhis anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the \\ndoor, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid’s house, \\ntail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a \\nminute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his \\nlimbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. \\n\\nHarry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back \\ninto the forest and disappeared from view. \\n\\nHarry went back into Hagrid’s cabin to get the \\nInvisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a \\nblanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again, \\nhe found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin \\npatch. \\n\\n“Follow the spiders,” said Ron weakly, wiping his \\nmouth on his sleeve. “I’ll never forgive Hagrid. We’re \\nlucky to be alive.” \\n\\n“I bet he thought Aragog wouldn’t hurt friends of his,” \\nsaid Harry. \\n\\n“That’s exactly Hagrid’s problem!” said Ron, thumping \\nthe wall of the cabin. “He always thinks monsters \\naren’t as bad as they’re made out, and look where it’s \\ngot him! A cell in Azkaban!” He was shivering \\nuncontrollably now. “What was the point of sending \\nus in there? What have we found out, I’d like to \\nknow?” \\n\\n“That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,” \\nsaid Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding \\nhim in the arm to make him walk. “He was innocent.” \\n\\nPage | 312 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in \\na cupboard wasn’t his idea of being innocent. \\n\\nAs the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak \\nto make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the \\ncreaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back \\nacross the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, \\nholding their breath as they passed corridors where \\nwatchful sentries were walking. At last they reached \\nthe safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the \\nfire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off \\nthe cloak and climbed the winding stair to their \\ndormitory. \\n\\nRon fell onto his bed without bothering to get \\nundressed. Harry, however, didn’t feel very sleepy. He \\nsat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about \\neverything Aragog had said. \\n\\nThe creature that was lurking somewhere in the \\ncastle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster \\nVoldemort — even other monsters didn’t want to \\nname it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out \\nwhat it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even \\nHagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of \\nSecrets. \\n\\nHarry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned \\nback against his pillows, watching the moon glinting \\nat him through the tower window. \\n\\nHe couldn’t see what else they could do. They had hit \\ndead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong \\nperson, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one \\ncould tell whether it was the same person, or a \\ndifferent one, who had opened the Chamber this time. \\nThere was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still \\nthinking about what Aragog had said. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 313 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was becoming drowsy when what seemed like \\ntheir very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly \\nsat bolt upright. \\n\\n“Ron,” he hissed through the dark, “Ron — ” \\n\\nRon woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly \\naround, and saw Harry. \\n\\n“Ron — that girl who died. Aragog said she was found \\nin a bathroom,” said Harry, ignoring Neville’s \\nsnuffling snores from the corner. “What if she never \\nleft the bathroom? What if she’s still there?” \\n\\nRon rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. \\nAnd then he understood, too. \\n\\n“You don’t think — not Moaning Myrtle ?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 314 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHAMBER OF SECRETS \\n\\nAll those times we were in that bathroom, and she \\nwas just three toilets away,” said Ron bitterly at \\nbreakfast next day, “and we could’ve asked her, and \\nnow ...” \\n\\nIt had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. \\nEscaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a \\ngirls’ bathroom, the girls’ bathroom, moreover, right \\nnext to the scene of the first attack, was going to be \\nalmost impossible. \\n\\nBut something happened in their first lesson, \\nTransfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets \\nout of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten \\nminutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told \\nthem that their exams would start on the first of \\nJune, one week from today. \\n\\n“Exams?” howled Seamus Finnigan. “We’re still \\ngetting exams?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 315 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville \\nLongbottom’s wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs \\non his desk. Professor McGonagall restored it with a \\nwave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to \\nSeamus. \\n\\n“The whole point of keeping the school open at this \\ntime is for you to receive your education,” she said \\nsternly. “The exams will therefore take place as usual, \\nand I trust you are all studying hard.” \\n\\nStudying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that \\nthere would be exams with the castle in this state. \\nThere was a great deal of mutinous muttering around \\nthe room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl \\neven more darkly. \\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the \\nschool running as normally as possible,” she said. \\n“And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out \\nhow much you have learned this year.” \\n\\nHarry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was \\nsupposed to be turning into slippers. What had he \\nlearned so far this year? He couldn’t seem to think of \\nanything that would be useful in an exam. \\n\\nRon looked as though he’d just been told he had to go \\nand live in the Forbidden Forest. \\n\\n“Can you imagine me taking exams with this?” he \\nasked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just \\nstarted whistling loudly. \\n\\nThree days before their first exam, Professor \\nMcGonagall made another announcement at \\nbreakfast. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 316 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have good news,” she said, and the Great Hall, \\ninstead of falling silent, erupted. \\n\\n“Dumbledore’s coming back!” several people yelled \\njoyfully. \\n\\n“You’ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!” squealed a girl \\nat the Ravenclaw table. \\n\\n“Quidditch matches are back on!” roared Wood \\nexcitedly. \\n\\nWhen the hubbub had subsided, Professor \\nMcGonagall said, “Professor Sprout has informed me \\nthat the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. \\nTonight, we will be able to revive those people who \\nhave been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that \\none of them may well be able to tell us who, or what, \\nattacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year \\nwill end with our catching the culprit.” \\n\\nThere was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over \\nat the Slytherin table and wasn’t at all surprised to \\nsee that Draco Malfoy hadn’t joined in. Ron, however, \\nwas looking happier than he’d looked in days. \\n\\n“It won’t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!” he \\nsaid to Harry. “Hermione’ll probably have all the \\nanswers when they wake her up! Mind you, she’ll go \\ncrazy when she finds out we’ve got exams in three \\ndays’ time. She hasn’t studied. It might be kinder to \\nleave her where she is till they’re over.” \\n\\nJust then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down \\nnext to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry \\nnoticed that her hands were twisting in her lap. \\n\\n“What’s up?” said Ron, helping himself to more \\nporridge. \\n\\nPage | 317 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGinny didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down \\nthe Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face \\nthat reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn’t \\nthink who. \\n\\n“Spit it out,” said Ron, watching her. \\n\\nHarry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She \\nwas rocking backward and forward slightly in her \\nchair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering \\non the edge of revealing forbidden information. \\n\\n“I’ve got to tell you something,” Ginny mumbled, \\ncarefully not looking at Harry. \\n\\n“What is it?” said Harry. \\n\\nGinny looked as though she couldn’t find the right \\nwords. \\n\\n“What?” said Ron. \\n\\nGinny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. \\nHarry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only \\nGinny and Ron could hear him. \\n\\n“Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have \\nyou seen something? Someone acting oddly?” \\n\\nGinny drew a deep breath and, at that precise \\nmoment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and \\nwan. \\n\\n“If you’ve finished eating, I’ll take that seat, Ginny. I’m \\nstarving, I’ve only just come off patrol duty.” \\n\\nGinny jumped up as though her chair had just been \\nelectrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 318 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nscampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug \\nfrom the center of the table. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Percy!” said Ron angrily. “She was just about to tell \\nus something important!” \\n\\nHalfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked. \\n\\n“What sort of thing?” he said, coughing. \\n\\n“I just asked her if she’d seen anything odd, and she \\nstarted to say — ” \\n\\n“Oh — that — that’s nothing to do with the Chamber \\nof Secrets,” said Percy at once. \\n\\n“How do you know?” said Ron, his eyebrows raised. \\n\\n“Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on \\nme the other day when I was — well, never mind — \\nthe point is, she spotted me doing something and I, \\num, I asked her not to mention it to anybody. I must \\nsay, I did think she’d keep her word. It’s nothing, \\nreally, I’d just rather — ” \\n\\nHarry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable. \\n\\n“What were you doing, Percy?” said Ron, grinning. \\n\\n“Go on, tell us, we won’t laugh.” \\n\\nPercy didn’t smile back. \\n\\n“Pass me those rolls, Harry, I’m starving.” \\n\\nHarry knew the whole mystery might be solved \\ntomorrow without their help, but he wasn’t about to \\npass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up — \\nand to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were \\nbeing led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart. \\n\\nPage | 319 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLockhart, who had so often assured them that all \\ndanger had passed, only to be proved wrong right \\naway, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was \\nhardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the \\ncorridors. His hair wasn’t as sleek as usual; it seemed \\nhe had been up most of the night, patrolling the \\nfourth floor. \\n\\n“Mark my words,” he said, ushering them around a \\ncorner. “The first words out of those poor Petrified \\npeople’s mouths will be ‘It was Hagrid.’ Frankly, I’m \\nastounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these \\nsecurity measures are necessary.” \\n\\n“I agree, sir,” said Harry, making Ron drop his books \\nin surprise. \\n\\n“Thank you, Harry,” said Lockhart graciously while \\nthey waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. “I \\nmean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on \\nwith, without walking students to classes and \\nstanding guard all night. ...” \\n\\n“That’s right,” said Ron, catching on. “Why don’t you \\nleave us here, sir, we’ve only got one more corridor to \\ngo-” \\n\\n\\n\\n“You know, Weasley, I think I will,” said Lockhart. “I \\nreally should go and prepare my next class — ” \\n\\nAnd he hurried off. \\n\\n“Prepare his class,” Ron sneered after him. “Gone to \\ncurl his hair, more like.” \\n\\nThey let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of \\nthem, then darted down a side passage and hurried \\noff toward Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. But just as \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 320 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey were congratulating each other on their brilliant \\nscheme — \\n\\n“Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?” \\n\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the \\nthinnest of thin lines. \\n\\n“We were — we were — ” Ron stammered. “We were \\ngoing to — to go and see — ” \\n\\n“Hermione,” said Harry. Ron and Professor \\nMcGonagall both looked at him. \\n\\n“We haven’t seen her for ages, Professor,” Harry went \\non hurriedly, treading on Ron’s foot, “and we thought \\nwe’d sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell \\nher the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to \\nworry — ” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for \\na moment, Harry thought she was going to explode, \\nbut when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky \\nvoice. \\n\\n“Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear \\nglistening in her beady eye. “Of course, I realize this \\nhas all been hardest on the friends of those who have \\nbeen ... I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you \\nmay visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns \\nwhere you’ve gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given \\nmy permission.” \\n\\nHarry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe \\nthat they’d avoided detention. As they turned the \\ncorner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall \\nblow her nose. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 321 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That,” said Ron fervently, “was the best story you’ve \\never come up with.” \\n\\nThey had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing \\nand tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor \\nMcGonagall’s permission to visit Hermione. \\n\\nMadam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly. \\n\\n“There’s just no point talking to a Petrified person,” \\nshe said, and they had to admit she had a point when \\nthey’d taken their seats next to Hermione. It was \\nplain that Hermione didn’t have the faintest inkling \\nthat she had visitors, and that they might just as well \\ntell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it \\nwould do. \\n\\n“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said \\nRon, looking sadly at Hermione ’s rigid face. “Because \\nif he sneaked up on them all, no one’ll ever know. ...” \\n\\nBut Harry wasn’t looking at Hermione’s face. He was \\nmore interested in her right hand. It lay clenched on \\ntop of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a \\npiece of paper was scrunched inside her fist. \\n\\nMaking sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, \\nhe pointed this out to Ron. \\n\\n“Try and get it out,” Ron whispered, shifting his chair \\nso that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey’s view. \\n\\nIt was no easy task. Hermione’s hand was clamped so \\ntightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was \\ngoing to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and \\ntwisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the \\npaper came free. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 322 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry \\nsmoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read \\nit, too. \\n\\n\\n\\nOf the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam \\nour land, there is none more curious or more deadly \\nthan the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. \\nThis snake, which may reach gigantic size and live \\nmany hundreds of years, is born from a chicken’s egg, \\nhatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are \\nmost wondrous, for aside from its deadly and \\nvenomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, \\nand all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall \\nsuffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, \\nfor it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only \\nfrom the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it. \\n\\nAnd beneath this, a single word had been written, in \\na hand Harry recognized as Hermione’s. Pipes. \\n\\nIt was as though somebody had just flicked a light on \\nin his brain. \\n\\n“Ron,” he breathed. “This is it. This is the answer. The \\nmonster in the Chamber’s a basilisk — a giant \\nserpent! That’s why I’ve been hearing that voice all \\nover the place, and nobody else has heard it. It’s \\nbecause I understand Parseltongue. ...” \\n\\nHarry looked up at the beds around him. \\n\\n“The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no \\none’s died — because no one looked it straight in the \\neye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk \\nburned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got \\nPetrified. Justin ... Justin must’ve seen the basilisk \\nthrough Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast \\nPage | 323 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof it, but he couldn’t die again ... and Hermione and \\nthat Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next \\nto them. Hermione had just realized the monster was \\na basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first \\nperson she met to look around corners with a mirror \\nfirst! And that girl pulled out her mirror — and — ” \\n\\nRon’s jaw had dropped. \\n\\n“And Mrs. Norris?” he whispered eagerly. \\n\\nHarry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night \\nof Halloween. \\n\\n“The water ...” he said slowly. “The flood from \\nMoaning Myrtle’s bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris \\nonly saw the reflection. ...” \\n\\nHe scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more \\nhe looked at it, the more it made sense. \\n\\n\"... The crowing of the rooster ... is fatal to if!” he read \\naloud. “Hagrid’s roosters were killed! The Heir of \\nSlytherin didn’t want one anywhere near the castle \\nonce the Chamber was opened! Spiders flee before it\\\\ \\n\\nIt all fits!” \\n\\n“But how’s the basilisk been getting around the \\nplace?” said Ron. “A giant snake ... Someone would’ve \\nseen ...” \\n\\nHarry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had \\nscribbled at the foot of the page. \\n\\n“Pipes,” he said. “Pipes ... Ron, it’s been using the \\nplumbing. I’ve been hearing that voice inside the \\nwalls. ...” \\n\\nRon suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm. \\n\\nPage | 324 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!” he said \\nhoarsely. “What if it’s a bathroom? What if it’s in — ” \\n\\n“ — Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom,” said Harry. \\n\\nThey sat there, excitement coursing through them, \\nhardly able to believe it. \\n\\n“This means,” said Harry, “I can’t be the only \\nParselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin’s \\none, too. That’s how he’s been controlling the \\nbasilisk.” \\n\\n“What’re we going to do?” said Ron, whose eyes were \\nflashing. “Should we go straight to McGonagall?” \\n\\n“Let’s go to the staffroom,” said Harry, jumping up. \\n“She’ll be there in ten minutes. It’s nearly break.” \\n\\nThey ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered \\nhanging around in another corridor, they went \\nstraight into the deserted staffroom. It was a large, \\npaneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Harry and \\nRon paced around it, too excited to sit down. \\n\\nBut the bell to signal break never came. \\n\\nInstead, echoing through the corridors came Professor \\nMcGonagall’s voice, magically magnified. \\n\\n“All students to return to their House dormitories at \\nonce. All teachers return to the staffroom. Immediately, \\nplease.” \\n\\nHarry wheeled around to stare at Ron. \\n\\n“Not another attack? Not now?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 325 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’ll we do?” said Ron, aghast. “Go back to the \\ndormitory?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly \\nsort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers’ \\ncloaks. “In here. Let’s hear what it’s all about. Then \\nwe can tell them what we’ve found out.” \\n\\nThey hid themselves inside it, listening to the \\nrumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and \\nthe staffroom door banging open. From between the \\nmusty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers \\nfiltering into the room. Some of them were looking \\npuzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor \\nMcGonagall arrived. \\n\\n“It has happened,” she told the silent staffroom. “A \\nstudent has been taken by the monster. Right into \\nthe Chamber itself.” \\n\\nProfessor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout \\nclapped her hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the \\nback of a chair very hard and said, “How can you be \\nsure?” \\n\\n“The Heir of Slytherin,” said Professor McGonagall, \\nwho was very white, “left another message. Right \\nunderneath the first one. ‘Her skeleton will lie in the \\nChamber forever.’ ” \\n\\nProfessor Flitwick burst into tears. \\n\\n“Who is it?” said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak- \\nkneed, into a chair. “Which student?” \\n\\n“Ginny Weasley,” said Professor McGonagall. \\n\\nHarry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe \\nfloor beside him. \\n\\nPage | 326 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We shall have to send all the students home \\ntomorrow,” said Professor McGonagall. “This is the \\nend of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said ...” \\n\\nThe staffroom door banged open again. For one wild \\nmoment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. \\n\\nBut it was Lockhart, and he was beaming. \\n\\n“So sorry — dozed off — what have I missed?” \\n\\nHe didn’t seem to notice that the other teachers were \\nlooking at him with something remarkably like \\nhatred. Snape stepped forward. \\n\\n“Just the man,” he said. “The very man. A girl has \\nbeen snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into \\nthe Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come \\nat last.” \\n\\nLockhart blanched. \\n\\n“That’s right, Gilderoy,” chipped in Professor Sprout. \\n“Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known \\nall along where the entrance to the Chamber of \\nSecrets is?” \\n\\n“I — well, I — ” sputtered Lockhart. \\n\\n“Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what \\nwas inside it?” piped up Professor Flitwick. \\n\\n“D-did I? I don’t recall — ” \\n\\n“I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you \\nhadn’t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was \\narrested,” said Snape. “Didn’t you say that the whole \\naffair had been bungled, and that you should have \\nbeen given a free rein from the first?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 327 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I — I really never — you may have misunderstood — ” \\n\\n“Well leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall. “Tonight will be an excellent time to do \\nit. Well make sure everyone’s out of your way. You’ll \\nbe able to tackle the monster all by yourself. A free \\nrein at last.” \\n\\nLockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody \\ncame to the rescue. He didn’t look remotely handsome \\nanymore. His lip was trembling, and in the absence of \\nhis usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and \\nfeeble. \\n\\n“V-very well,” he said. “I’ll — I’ll be in my office, \\ngetting — getting ready.” \\n\\nAnd he left the room. \\n\\n“Right,” said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils \\nwere flared, “that’s got him out from under our feet. \\nThe Heads of Houses should go and inform their \\nstudents what has happened. Tell them the Hogwarts \\nExpress will take them home first thing tomorrow. \\n\\nWill the rest of you please make sure no students \\nhave been left outside their dormitories.” \\n\\nThe teachers rose and left, one by one. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was probably the worst day of Harry’s entire life. \\n\\nHe, Ron, Fred, and George sat together in a corner of \\nthe Gryffindor common room, unable to say anything \\nto each other. Percy wasn’t there. He had gone to \\nsend an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut \\nhimself up in his dormitory. \\n\\nPage | 328 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had \\nGryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. \\nNear sunset, Fred and George went up to bed, unable \\nto sit there any longer. \\n\\n“She knew something, Harry,” said Ron, speaking for \\nthe first time since they had entered the wardrobe in \\nthe staffroom. “That’s why she was taken. It wasn’t \\nsome stupid thing about Percy at all. She’d found out \\nsomething about the Chamber of Secrets. That must \\nbe why she was — ” Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. “I \\nmean, she was a pureblood. There can’t be any other \\nreason.” \\n\\nHarry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the \\nskyline. This was the worst he had ever felt. If only \\nthere was something they could do. Anything. \\n\\n“Harry,” said Ron. “D’you think there’s any chance at \\nall she’s not — you know — ” \\n\\nHarry didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t see how \\nGinny could still be alive. \\n\\n“D’you know what?” said Ron. “I think we should go \\nand see Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He’s going \\nto try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him \\nwhere we think it is, and tell him it’s a basilisk in \\nthere.” \\n\\nBecause Harry couldn’t think of anything else to do, \\nand because he wanted to be doing something, he \\nagreed. The Gryffindors around them were so \\nmiserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that \\nnobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the \\nroom, and left through the portrait hole. \\n\\nDarkness was falling as they walked down to \\nLockhart’s office. There seemed to be a lot of activity \\n\\nPage | 329 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngoing on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps, \\nand hurried footsteps. \\n\\nHarry knocked and there was a sudden silence from \\ninside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and \\nthey saw one of Lockhart’s eyes peering through it. \\n\\n“Oh — Mr. Potter — Mr. Weasley — ” he said, opening \\nthe door a bit wider. “I’m rather busy at the moment \\n— if you would be quick — ” \\n\\n“Professor, we’ve got some information for you,” said \\nHarry. “We think it’ll help you.” \\n\\n“Er — well — it’s not terribly — ” The side of \\nLockhart’s face that they could see looked very \\nuncomfortable. “I mean — well — all right — ” \\n\\nHe opened the door and they entered. \\n\\nHis office had been almost completely stripped. Two \\nlarge trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade- \\ngreen, lilac, midnight-blue, had been hastily folded \\ninto one of them; books were jumbled untidily into \\nthe other. The photographs that had covered the walls \\nwere now crammed into boxes on the desk. \\n\\n“Are you going somewhere?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Er, well, yes,” said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster \\nof himself from the back of the door as he spoke and \\nstarting to roll it up. “Urgent call — unavoidable — \\ngot to go — ” \\n\\n“What about my sister?” said Ron jerkily. \\n\\n“Well, as to that — most unfortunate — ” said \\nLockhart, avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open a \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 330 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndrawer and started emptying the contents into a bag. \\n“No one regrets more than I — ” \\n\\n“You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!” \\nsaid Harry. “You can’t go now! Not with all the Dark \\nstuff going on here!” \\n\\n“Well — I must say — when I took the job — ” \\nLockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of his \\nrobes, “nothing in the job description — didn’t expect \\n\\n\\n\\n“You mean you’re running away? said Harry \\ndisbelievingly. “After all that stuff you did in your \\nbooks — ” \\n\\n“Books can be misleading,” said Lockhart delicately. \\n\\n“You wrote them!” Harry shouted. \\n\\n“My dear boy,” said Lockhart, straightening up and \\nfrowning at Harry. “Do use your common sense. My \\nbooks wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t \\nthink I’d done all those things. No one wants to read \\nabout some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did \\nsave a village from werewolves. He’d look dreadful on \\nthe front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch \\nwho banished the Bandon Banshee had a hairy chin. \\n\\nI mean, come on — ” \\n\\n“So you’ve just been taking credit for what a load of \\nother people have done?” said Harry incredulously. \\n\\n“Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, shaking his head \\nimpatiently, “it’s not nearly as simple as that. There \\nwas work involved. I had to track these people down. \\nAsk them exactly how they managed to do what they \\ndid. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so \\nthey wouldn’t remember doing it. If there’s one thing I \\nPage | 331 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npride myself on, it’s my Memory Charms. No, it’s been \\na lot of work, Harry. It’s not all book signings and \\npublicity photos, you know. You want fame, you have \\nto be prepared for a long hard slog.” \\n\\nHe banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked \\nthem. \\n\\n“Let’s see,” he said. “I think that’s everything. Yes. \\nOnly one thing left.” \\n\\nHe pulled out his wand and turned to them. \\n\\n“Awfully sorry, boys, but I’ll have to put a Memory \\nCharm on you now. Can’t have you blabbing my \\nsecrets all over the place. I’d never sell another book \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had \\nbarely raised his, when Harry bellowed, \\n\\n“ Expelliarmus\\\\ ” \\n\\nLockhart was blasted backward, falling over his \\ntrunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, \\nand flung it out of the open window. \\n\\n“Shouldn’t have let Professor Snape teach us that \\none,” said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk \\naside. Lockhart was looking up at him, feeble once \\nmore. Harry was still pointing his wand at him. \\n\\n“What d’you want me to do?” said Lockhart weakly. “I \\ndon’t know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There’s \\nnothing I can do.” \\n\\n“You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his \\nfeet at wandpoint. “We think we know where it is. \\nAnd what’s inside it. Let’s go.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 332 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey marched Lockhart out of his office and down the \\nnearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the \\nmessages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning \\nMyrtle’s bathroom. \\n\\nThey sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see \\nthat he was shaking. \\n\\nMoaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end \\ntoilet. \\n\\n“Oh, it’s you,” she said when she saw Harry. “What do \\nyou want this time?” \\n\\n“To ask you how you died,” said Harry. \\n\\nMyrtle’s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as \\nthough she had never been asked such a flattering \\nquestion. \\n\\n“Ooooh, it was dreadful,” she said with relish. “It \\nhappened right in here. I died in this very stall. I \\nremember it so well. I’d hidden because Olive Hornby \\nwas teasing me about my glasses. The door was \\nlocked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody \\ncome in. They said something funny. A different \\nlanguage, I think it must have been. Anyway, what \\nreally got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I \\nunlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own \\ntoilet, and then — ” Myrtle swelled importantly, her \\nface shining. “I died.” \\n\\n“How?” said Harry. \\n\\n“No idea,” said Myrtle in hushed tones. “I just \\nremember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My \\nwhole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating \\naway. ...” She looked dreamily at Harry. “And then I \\ncame back again. I was determined to haunt Olive \\nPage | 333 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she’d ever \\nlaughed at my glasses.” \\n\\n“Where exactly did you see the eyes?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Somewhere there,” said Myrtle, pointing vaguely \\ntoward the sink in front of her toilet. \\n\\nHarry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was \\nstanding well back, a look of utter terror on his face. \\n\\nIt looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every \\ninch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below. \\nAnd then Harry saw it: Scratched on the side of one of \\nthe copper taps was a tiny snake. \\n\\n“That tap’s never worked,” said Myrtle brightly as he \\ntried to turn it. \\n\\n“Harry,” said Ron. “Say something. Something in \\nParseltongue.” \\n\\n“But — ” Harry thought hard. The only times he’d ever \\nmanaged to speak Parseltongue were when he’d been \\nfaced with a real snake. He stared hard at the tiny \\nengraving, trying to imagine it was real. \\n\\n“Open up,” he said. \\n\\nHe looked at Ron, who shook his head. \\n\\n“English,” he said. \\n\\nHarry looked back at the snake, willing himself to \\nbelieve it was alive. If he moved his head, the \\ncandlelight made it look as though it were moving. \\n\\n“Open up,” he said. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 334 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExcept that the words weren’t what he heard; a \\nstrange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap \\nglowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. \\nNext second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, \\nsank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, \\na pipe wide enough for a man to slide into. \\n\\nHarry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had \\nmade up his mind what he was going to do. \\n\\n“I’m going down there,” he said. \\n\\nHe couldn’t not go, not now they had found the \\nentrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the \\nfaintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might \\nbe alive. \\n\\n“Me too,” said Ron. \\n\\nThere was a pause. \\n\\n“Well, you hardly seem to need me,” said Lockhart, \\nwith a shadow of his old smile. “I’ll just — ” \\n\\nHe put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry \\nboth pointed their wands at him. \\n\\n“You can go first,” Ron snarled. \\n\\nWhite-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the \\nopening. \\n\\n“Boys,” he said, his voice feeble. “Boys, what good will \\nit do?” \\n\\nHarry jabbed him in the back with his wand. \\n\\nLockhart slid his legs into the pipe. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 335 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I really don’t think — ” he started to say, but Ron \\ngave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry \\nfollowed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the \\npipe, then let go. \\n\\nIt was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark \\nslide. He could see more pipes branching off in all \\ndirections, but none as large as theirs, which twisted \\nand turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew \\nthat he was falling deeper below the school than even \\nthe dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, \\nthudding slightly at the curves. \\n\\nAnd then, just as he had begun to worry about what \\nwould happen when he hit the ground, the pipe \\nleveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet \\nthud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone \\ntunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting \\nto his feet a little ways away, covered in slime and \\nwhite as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came \\nwhizzing out of the pipe, too. \\n\\n“We must be miles under the school,” said Harry, his \\nvoice echoing in the black tunnel. \\n\\n“Under the lake, probably,” said Ron, squinting \\naround at the dark, slimy walls. \\n\\nAll three of them turned to stare into the darkness \\nahead. \\n\\n“Lumosl” Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \\n“C’mon,” he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they \\nwent, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor. \\n\\nThe tunnel was so dark that they could only see a \\nlittle distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls \\nlooked monstrous in the wandlight. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 336 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Remember,” Harry said quietly as they walked \\ncautiously forward, “any sign of movement, close your \\neyes right away. ...” \\n\\nBut the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first \\nunexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as \\nRon stepped on what turned out to be a rat’s skull. \\nHarry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw \\nthat it was littered with small animal bones. Trying \\nvery hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if \\nthey found her, Harry led the way forward, around a \\ndark bend in the tunnel. \\n\\n“Harry — there’s something up there — ” said Ron \\nhoarsely, grabbing Harry’s shoulder. \\n\\nThey froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline \\nof something huge and curved, lying right across the \\ntunnel. It wasn’t moving. \\n\\n“Maybe it’s asleep,” he breathed, glancing back at the \\nother two. Lockhart’s hands were pressed over his \\neyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart \\nbeating so fast it hurt. \\n\\nVery slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make \\nthem and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand \\nheld high. \\n\\nThe light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, \\npoisonous green, lying curled and empty across the \\ntunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have \\nbeen twenty feet long at least. \\n\\n“Blimey,” said Ron weakly. \\n\\nThere was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy \\nLockhart’s knees had given way. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 337 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Get up,” said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at \\nLockhart. \\n\\nLockhart got to his feet — then he dived at Ron, \\nknocking him to the ground. \\n\\nHarry jumped forward, but too late — Lockhart was \\nstraightening up, panting, Ron’s wand in his hand \\nand a gleaming smile back on his face. \\n\\n“The adventure ends here, boys!” he said. “I shall take \\na bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I \\nwas too late to save the girl, and that you two \\ntragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled \\nbody — say good-bye to your memories!” \\n\\nHe raised Ron’s Spellotaped wand high over his head \\nand yelled, “Obliviatel” \\n\\nThe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. \\nHarry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping \\nover the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great \\nchunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the \\nfloor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at \\na solid wall of broken rock. \\n\\n“Ron!” he shouted. “Are you okay? Ron!” \\n\\n“I’m here!” came Ron’s muffled voice from behind the \\nrock-fall. “I’m okay — this git’s not, though — he got \\nblasted by the wand — ” \\n\\nThere was a dull thud and a loud “ow!” It sounded as \\nthough Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins. \\n\\n“What now?” Ron’s voice said, sounding desperate. \\n“We can’t get through — it’ll take ages. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 338 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks \\nhad appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart \\nanything as large as these rocks by magic, and now \\ndidn’t seem a good moment to try — what if the whole \\ntunnel caved in? \\n\\nThere was another thud and another “ow!” from \\nbehind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had \\nalready been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours. ... \\nHarry knew there was only one thing to do. \\n\\n“Wait there,” he called to Ron. “Wait with Lockhart. I’ll \\ngo on. ... If I’m not back in an hour ...” \\n\\nThere was a very pregnant pause. \\n\\n“I’ll try and shift some of this rock,” said Ron, who \\nseemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. “So you \\ncan — can get back through. And, Harry — ” \\n\\n“See you in a bit,” said Harry, trying to inject some \\nconfidence into his shaking voice. \\n\\nAnd he set off alone past the giant snake skin. \\n\\nSoon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the \\nrocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. \\nEvery nerve in Harry’s body was tingling \\nunpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet \\ndreaded what he’d find when it did. And then, at last, \\nas he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid \\nwall ahead on which two entwined serpents were \\ncarved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds. \\n\\nHarry approached, his throat very dry. There was no \\nneed to pretend these stone snakes were real; their \\neyes looked strangely alive. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 339 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe could guess what he had to do. He cleared his \\nthroat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker. \\n\\n“Open,” said Harry, in a low, faint hiss. \\n\\nThe serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the \\nhalves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking \\nfrom head to foot, walked inside. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 340 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN \\n\\nHe was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit \\nchamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more \\ncarved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in \\ndarkness, casting long, black shadows through the \\nodd, greenish gloom that filled the place. \\n\\nHis heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to \\nthe chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a \\nshadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was \\nGinny? \\n\\nHe pulled out his wand and moved forward between \\nthe serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed \\nloudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes \\nnarrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest \\nsign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone \\nsnakes seemed to be following him. More than once, \\nwith a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir. \\n\\nThen, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a \\nstatue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, \\nstanding against the back wall. \\n\\nPage | 341 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant \\nface above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a \\nlong, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the \\nwizard’s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous \\ngray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And \\nbetween the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed \\nfigure with flaming-red hair. \\n\\n“Ginnyl” Harry muttered, sprinting to her and \\ndropping to his knees. “Ginny — don’t be dead — \\nplease don’t be dead — ” He flung his wand aside, \\ngrabbed Ginny’s shoulders, and turned her over. Her \\nface was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes \\nwere closed, so she wasn’t Petrified. But then she \\nmust be — \\n\\n“Ginny, please wake up,” Harry muttered desperately, \\nshaking her. Ginny’s head lolled hopelessly from side \\nto side. \\n\\n“She won’t wake,” said a soft voice. \\n\\nHarry jumped and spun around on his knees. \\n\\nA tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the \\nnearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred \\naround the edges, as though Harry were looking at \\nhim through a misted window. But there was no \\nmistaking him — \\n\\n“Tom — Tom Riddle?” \\n\\nRiddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry’s face. \\n\\n“What d’you mean, she won’t wake?” Harry said \\ndesperately. “She’s not — she’s not — ?” \\n\\n“She’s still alive,” said Riddle. “But only just.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 342 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at \\nHogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, \\nmisty light shining about him, not a day older than \\nsixteen. \\n\\n“Are you a ghost?” Harry said uncertainly. \\n\\n“A memory,” said Riddle quietly. “Preserved in a diary \\nfor fifty years.” \\n\\nHe pointed toward the floor near the statue’s giant \\ntoes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry \\nhad found in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. For a \\nsecond, Harry wondered how it had got there — but \\nthere were more pressing matters to deal with. \\n\\n“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” Harry said, raising \\nGinny’s head again. “We’ve got to get her out of here. \\nThere’s a basilisk ... I don’t know where it is, but it \\ncould be along any moment. ... Please, help me — ” \\n\\nRiddle didn’t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist \\nGinny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand \\nagain. \\n\\nBut his wand had gone. \\n\\n“Did you see — ?” \\n\\nHe looked up. Riddle was still watching him — \\ntwirling Harry’s wand between his long fingers. \\n\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, stretching out his hand for it. \\n\\nA smile curled the corners of Riddle’s mouth. He \\ncontinued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 343 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Listen,” said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with \\nGinny’s dead weight. “We’ve got to go\\\\ If the basilisk \\ncomes — ” \\n\\n“It won’t come until it is called,” said Riddle calmly. \\n\\nHarry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to \\nhold her up any longer. \\n\\n“What d’you mean?” he said. “Look, give me my wand, \\nI might need it — ” \\n\\nRiddle’s smile broadened. \\n\\n“You won’t be needing it,” he said. \\n\\nHarry stared at him. \\n\\n“What d’you mean, I won’t be — ?” \\n\\n“I’ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,” said \\nRiddle. “For the chance to see you. To speak to you.” \\n\\n“Look,” said Harry, losing patience, “I don’t think you \\nget it. We’re in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk \\nlater — ” \\n\\n“We’re going to talk now,” said Riddle, still smiling \\nbroadly, and he pocketed Harry’s wand. \\n\\nHarry stared at him. There was something very funny \\ngoing on here. ... \\n\\n“How did Ginny get like this?” he asked slowly. \\n\\n“Well, that’s an interesting question,” said Riddle \\npleasantly. “And quite a long story. I suppose the real \\nreason Ginny Weasley’s like this is because she \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 344 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an \\ninvisible stranger.” \\n\\n“What are you talking about?” said Harry. \\n\\n“The diary,” said Riddle. “My diary. Little Ginny’s been \\nwriting in it for months and months, telling me all her \\npitiful worries and woes — how her brothers tease \\nher, how she had to come to school with secondhand \\nrobes and books, how” — Riddle’s eyes glinted — \\n\\n“how she didn’t think famous, good, great Harry \\nPotter would ever like her. ...” \\n\\nAll the time he spoke, Riddle’s eyes never left Harry’s \\nface. There was an almost hungry look in them. \\n\\n“It’s very boring, having to listen to the silly little \\ntroubles of an eleven-year-old girl,” he went on. “But I \\nwas patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was \\nkind. Ginny simply loved me. No one’s ever \\nunderstood me like you, Tom. ... I’m so glad I’ve got \\nthis diary to confide in. ... It’s like having a friend I can \\ncarry around in my pocket. ...” \\n\\nRiddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn’t suit \\nhim. It made the hairs stand up on the back of \\nHarry’s neck. \\n\\n“If I say it myself, Harry, I’ve always been able to \\ncharm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her \\nsoul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what \\nI wanted. ... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of \\nher deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew \\npowerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. \\nPowerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few \\nof my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back \\ninto her ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 345 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry, whose mouth had \\ngone very dry. \\n\\n“Haven’t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?” said Riddle \\nsoftly. “Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of \\nSecrets. She strangled the school roosters and \\ndaubed threatening messages on the walls. She set \\nthe Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the \\nSquib’s cat.” \\n\\n“No,” Harry whispered. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Riddle, calmly. “Of course, she didn’t know \\nwhat she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I \\nwish you could have seen her new diary entries . . . far \\nmore interesting, they became. ... Dear Tom,” he \\nrecited, watching Harry’s horrified face, “7 think I’m \\nlosing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over \\nmy robes and I don’t know how they got there. Dear \\nTom, I can’t remember what I did on the night of \\nHalloween, but a cat was attacked and I’ve got paint \\nall down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me \\nI’m pale and I’m not myself. I think he suspects me. . . . \\nThere was another attack today and I don’t know \\nwhere I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I’m \\ngoing mad. ... I think I’m the one attacking everyone, \\nTom\\\\” \\n\\nHarry’s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep \\ninto his palms. \\n\\n“It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop \\ntrusting her diary,” said Riddle. “But she finally \\nbecame suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And \\nthat’s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I \\ncouldn’t have been more delighted. Of all the people \\nwho could have picked it up, it was you, the very \\nperson I was most anxious to meet. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 346 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And why did you want to meet me?” said Harry. \\n\\nAnger was coursing through him, and it was an effort \\nto keep his voice steady. \\n\\n“Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,” \\nsaid Riddle. “Your whole fascinating history.” His eyes \\nroved over the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead, and \\ntheir expression grew hungrier. “I knew I must find \\nout more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. \\nSo I decided to show you my famous capture of that \\ngreat oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust — ” \\n\\n“Hagrid’s my friend,” said Harry, his voice now \\nshaking. “And you framed him, didn’t you? I thought \\nyou made a mistake, but — ” \\n\\nRiddle laughed his high laugh again. \\n\\n“It was my word against Hagrid’s, Harry. Well, you \\ncan imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On \\nthe one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, \\nparentless but so brave, school prefect, model student \\n... on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in \\ntrouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf \\ncubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden \\nForest to wrestle trolls ... but I admit, even / was \\nsurprised how well the plan worked. I thought \\nsomeone must realize that Hagrid couldn’t possibly be \\nthe Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years \\nto find out everything I could about the Chamber of \\nSecrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though \\nHagrid had the brains, or the power! \\n\\n“Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, \\nseemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded \\nDippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. \\nYes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed. ... \\nDumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the \\nother teachers did. ...” \\n\\nPage | 347 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,” said \\nHarry, his teeth gritted. \\n\\n“Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on \\nme after Hagrid was expelled,” said Riddle carelessly. \\n“I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again \\nwhile I was still at school. But I wasn’t going to waste \\nthose long years I’d spent searching for it. I decided to \\nleave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old \\nself in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would \\nbe able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish \\nSalazar Slytherin’s noble work.” \\n\\n“Well, you haven’t finished it,” said Harry \\ntriumphantly. “No one’s died this time, not even the \\ncat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be \\nready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right \\nagain — ” \\n\\n“Haven’t I already told you,” said Riddle quietly, “that \\nkilling Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore? For \\nmany months now, my new target has been — you.” \\n\\nHarry stared at him. \\n\\n“Imagine how angry I was when the next time my \\ndiary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to \\nme, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and \\npanicked. What if you found out how to work it, and I \\nrepeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I \\ntold you who’d been strangling roosters? So the \\nfoolish little brat waited until your dormitory was \\ndeserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must \\ndo. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of \\nSlytherin’s heir. From everything Ginny had told me \\nabout you, I knew you would go to any lengths to \\nsolve the mystery — particularly if one of your best \\nfriends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 348 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhole school was buzzing because you could speak \\nParseltongue. ... \\n\\n“So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall \\nand come down here to wait. She struggled and cried \\nand became very boring. But there isn’t much life left \\nin her. ... She put too much into the diary, into me. \\nEnough to let me leave its pages at last. ... I have \\nbeen waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I \\nknew you’d come. I have many questions for you, \\nHarry Potter.” \\n\\n“Like what?” Harry spat, fists still clenched. \\n\\n“Well,” said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, “how is it that \\nyou — a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical \\ntalent — managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all \\ntime? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, \\nwhile Lord Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?” \\n\\nThere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now. \\n\\n“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. \\n“Voldemort was after your time. ...” \\n\\n“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, \\nand future, Harry Potter. ...” \\n\\nHe pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to \\ntrace it through the air, writing three shimmering \\nwords: \\n\\ntom marvolo riddle \\n\\nThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his \\nname rearranged themselves: \\n\\ni am lord voldemort \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 349 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already \\nusing at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, \\nof course. You think I was going to use my filthy \\nMuggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs \\nthe blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my \\nmother’s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common \\nMuggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, \\njust because he found out his wife was a witch? No, \\nHarry — I fashioned myself a new name, a name I \\nknew wizards everywhere would one day fear to \\nspeak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the \\nworld!” \\n\\nHarry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared \\nnumbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had \\ngrown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so \\nmany others. ... At last he forced himself to speak. \\n\\n“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred. \\n\\n“Not what?” snapped Riddle. \\n\\n“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, \\nbreathing fast. “Sorry to disappoint you and all that, \\nbut the greatest wizard in the world is Albus \\nDumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were \\nstrong, you didn’t dare try and take over at Hogwarts. \\nDumbledore saw through you when you were at \\nschool and he still frightens you now, wherever you’re \\nhiding these days — ” \\n\\nThe smile had gone from Riddle’s face, to be replaced \\nby a very ugly look. \\n\\n“Dumbledore ’s been driven out of this castle by the \\nmere memory of me!” he hissed. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 350 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“He’s not as gone as you might think!” Harry retorted. \\nHe was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, \\nwishing rather than believing it to be true — \\n\\nRiddle opened his mouth, but froze. \\n\\nMusic was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled \\naround to stare down the empty Chamber. The music \\nwas growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling, \\nunearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry’s scalp and made \\nhis heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its \\nnormal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch \\nthat Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames \\nerupted at the top of the nearest pillar. \\n\\nA crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, \\npiping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a \\nglittering golden tail as long as a peacock’s and \\ngleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged \\nbundle. \\n\\nA second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It \\ndropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, \\nthen landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its \\ngreat wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, \\nsharp golden beak and a beady black eye. \\n\\nThe bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to \\nHarry’s cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle. \\n\\n“That’s a phoenix. ...” said Riddle, staring shrewdly \\nback at it. \\n\\n“Fawkes?” Harry breathed, and he felt the bird’s \\ngolden claws squeeze his shoulder gently. \\n\\n“And that — ” said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing \\nthat Fawkes had dropped, “that’s the old school \\nSorting Hat — ” \\n\\nPage | 351 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay \\nmotionless at Harry’s feet. \\n\\nRiddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that \\nthe dark Chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles \\nwere laughing at once — \\n\\n“This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A \\nsongbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry \\nPotter? Do you feel safe now?” \\n\\nHarry didn’t answer. He might not see what use \\nFawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer \\nalone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with \\nhis courage mounting. \\n\\n“To business, Harry,” said Riddle, still smiling \\nbroadly. “Twice — in your past, in my future — we \\nhave met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you \\nsurvive ? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,” he \\nadded softly, “the longer you stay alive.” \\n\\nHarry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle \\nhad the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting \\nHat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. \\n\\nIt looked bad, all right . . . but the longer Riddle stood \\nthere, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and \\nin the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle’s \\noutline was becoming clearer, more solid. ... If it had \\nto be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner \\nthan later. \\n\\n“No one knows why you lost your powers when you \\nattacked me,” said Harry abruptly. “I don’t know \\nmyself. But I know why you couldn’t kill me. Because \\nmy mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born \\nmother,” he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \\n“She stopped you killing me. And I’ve seen the real \\nyou, I saw you last year. You’re a wreck. You’re barely \\nPage | 352 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nalive. That’s where all your power got you. You’re in \\nhiding. You’re ugly, you’re foul — ” \\n\\nRiddle’s face contorted. Then he forced it into an \\nawful smile. \\n\\n“So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that’s a \\npowerful counter-charm. I can see now ... there is \\nnothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you \\nsee. There are strange likenesses between us, after \\nall. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, \\norphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two \\nParselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great \\nSlytherin himself. We even look something alike ... \\nbut after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved \\nyou from me. That’s all I wanted to know.” \\n\\nHarry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his \\nwand. But Riddle’s twisted smile was widening again. \\n\\n“Now, Harry, I’m going to teach you a little lesson. \\nLet’s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of \\nSalazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and \\nthe best weapons Dumbledore can give him. ...” \\n\\nHe cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting \\nHat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his \\nnumb legs, watched Riddle stop between the high \\npillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, \\nhigh above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened \\nhis mouth wide and hissed — but Harry understood \\nwhat he was saying. . . . \\n\\n“ Speak to me, Slytherin , greatest of the Hogwarts \\nFour.” \\n\\nHarry wheeled around to look up at the statue, \\nFawkes swaying on his shoulder. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 353 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlytherin’s gigantic stone face was moving. \\nHorrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider \\nand wider, to make a huge black hole. \\n\\nAnd something was stirring inside the statue’s mouth. \\nSomething was slithering up from its depths. \\n\\nHarry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber \\nwall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes’ \\nwing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted \\nto shout, “Don’t leave me!” but what chance did a \\nphoenix have against the king of serpents? \\n\\nSomething huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. \\nHarry felt it shudder — he knew what was happening, \\nhe could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent \\nuncoiling itself from Slytherin’s mouth. Then he heard \\nRiddle’s hissing voice: \\n\\n“Kill him.” \\n\\nThe basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear \\nits heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty \\nfloor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run \\nblindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his \\nway — Voldemort was laughing — \\n\\nHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted \\nblood — the serpent was barely feet from him, he \\ncould hear it coming — \\n\\nThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above \\nhim, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard \\nthat he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs \\nto sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, \\nsomething thrashing wildly off the pillars — \\n\\nHe couldn’t help it — he opened his eyes wide enough \\nto squint at what was going on. \\n\\nPage | 354 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick \\nas an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and \\nits great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between \\nthe pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes \\nif it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake. \\n\\nFawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk \\nwas snapping furiously at him with fangs long and \\nthin as sabers — \\n\\nFawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight \\nand a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the \\nfloor. The snake’s tail thrashed, narrowly missing \\nHarry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned \\n\\n— Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its \\neyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been \\npunctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the \\nfloor, and the snake was spitting in agony. \\n\\n“NO!” Harry heard Riddle screaming. “LEAVE THE \\nBIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU! \\nYOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM! KILL HIM!” \\n\\nThe blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. \\nFawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song, \\njabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood \\npoured from its ruined eyes. \\n\\n“Help me, help me,” Harry muttered wildly, “someone \\n\\n— anyone — ” \\n\\nThe snake’s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry \\nducked. Something soft hit his face. \\n\\nThe basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry’s \\narms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only \\nchance — he rammed it onto his head and threw \\nhimself flat onto the floor as the basilisk’s tail swung \\nover him again. \\n\\nPage | 355 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHelp me — help me — Harry thought, his eyes \\nscrewed tight under the hat. Please help me — \\n\\nThere was no answering voice. Instead, the hat \\ncontracted, as though an invisible hand was \\nsqueezing it very tightly. \\n\\nSomething very hard and heavy thudded onto the top \\nof Harry’s head, almost knocking him out. Stars \\nwinking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the \\nhat to pull it off and felt something long and hard \\nbeneath it. \\n\\nA gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, \\nits handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs. \\n\\n“KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS \\nBEHIND YOU! SNIFF — SMELL HIM!” \\n\\nHarry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk’s head was \\nfalling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it \\ntwisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye \\nsockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough \\nto swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his \\nsword, thin, glittering, venomous — \\n\\nIt lunged blindly — Harry dodged and it hit the \\nChamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue \\nlashed Harry’s side. He raised the sword in both his \\nhands — \\n\\nThe basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was \\ntrue — Harry threw his whole weight behind the \\nsword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the \\nserpent’s mouth — \\n\\nBut as warm blood drenched Harry’s arms, he felt a \\nsearing pain just above his elbow. One long, \\npoisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into \\n\\nPage | 356 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over \\nsideways and fell, twitching, to the floor. \\n\\nHarry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that \\nwas spreading poison through his body and wrenched \\nit out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White- \\nhot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the \\nwound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his \\nown blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. \\nThe Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color. \\n\\nA patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft \\nclatter of claws beside him. \\n\\n“Fawkes,” said Harry thickly. “You were fantastic, \\nFawkes. ...” He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on \\nthe spot where the serpent’s fang had pierced him. \\n\\nHe could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark \\nshadow moved in front of him. \\n\\n“You’re dead, Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s voice above \\nhim. “Dead. Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you \\nsee what he’s doing, Potter? He’s crying.” \\n\\nHarry blinked. Fawkes’s head slid in and out of focus. \\nThick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy \\nfeathers. \\n\\n“I’m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. \\nTake your time. I’m in no hurry.” \\n\\nHarry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to \\nbe spinning. \\n\\n“So ends the famous Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s \\ndistant voice. “Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, \\nforsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark \\nLord he so unwisely challenged. You’ll be back with \\n\\nPage | 357 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. ... She \\nbought you twelve years of borrowed time . . . but Lord \\nVoldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf this is dying, thought Harry, it’s not so bad. \\n\\nEven the pain was leaving him. ... \\n\\nBut was this dying? Instead of going black, the \\nChamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry \\ngave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, \\nstill resting his head on Harry’s arm. A pearly patch \\nof tears was shining all around the wound — except \\nthat there was no wound — \\n\\n“Get away, bird,” said Riddle’s voice suddenly. “Get \\naway from him — I said, get away — ” \\n\\nHarry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry’s \\nwand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and \\nFawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet. \\n\\n“Phoenix tears ...” said Riddle quietly, staring at \\nHarry’s arm. “Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot \\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked into Harry’s face. “But it makes no \\ndifference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and \\nme, Harry Potter ... you and me. ...” \\n\\nHe raised the wand — \\n\\nThen, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back \\noverhead and something fell into Harry’s lap — the \\ndiary. \\n\\nFor a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still \\nraised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without \\n\\nPage | 358 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nconsidering, as though he had meant to do it all \\nalong, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next \\nto him and plunged it straight into the heart of the \\nbook. \\n\\nThere was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink \\nspurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over \\nHarry’s hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing \\nand twisting, screaming and flailing and then — \\n\\nHe had gone. Harry’s wand fell to the floor with a \\nclatter and there was silence. Silence except for the \\nsteady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The \\nbasilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right \\nthrough it. \\n\\nShaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head \\nwas spinning as though he’d just traveled miles by \\nFloo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand \\nand the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved \\nthe glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk’s \\nmouth. \\n\\nThen came a faint moan from the end of the \\nChamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried \\ntoward her, she sat up. Her bemused eyes traveled \\nfrom the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, \\nin his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his \\nhand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears \\nbegan to pour down her face. \\n\\n“Harry — oh, Harry — I tried to tell you at b- \\nbreakfast, but I c -couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it \\nwas me, Harry — but I — I s-swear I d-didn’t mean to \\n— R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over — and — \\nhow did you kill that — that thing? W-where’s Riddle? \\nThe last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the \\ndiary — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 359 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s all right,” said Harry, holding up the diary, and \\nshowing Ginny the fang hole, “Riddle’s finished. Look! \\nHim and the basilisk. C’mon, Ginny, let’s get out of \\nhere — ” \\n\\n“I’m going to be expelled!” Ginny wept as Harry helped \\nher awkwardly to her feet. “I’ve looked forward to \\ncoming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now \\nI’ll have to leave and — w-what’ll Mum and Dad say?” \\n\\nFawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the \\nChamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they \\nstepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, \\nthrough the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. \\nHarry heard the stone doors close behind them with a \\nsoft hiss. \\n\\nAfter a few minutes’ progress up the dark tunnel, a \\ndistant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry’s \\nears. \\n\\n“Ron!” Harry yelled, speeding up. “Ginny’s okay! I’ve \\ngot her!” \\n\\nHe heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned \\nthe next bend to see his eager face staring through \\nthe sizable gap he had managed to make in the \\nrockfall. \\n\\n“Ginny\\\\” Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the \\nrock to pull her through first. “You’re alive! I don’t \\nbelieve it! What happened? How — what — where did \\nthat bird come from?” \\n\\nFawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny. \\n\\n“He’s Dumbledore’s,” said Harry, squeezing through \\nhimself. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 360 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“How come you’ve got a sword?” said Ron, gaping at \\nthe glittering weapon in Harry’s hand. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll explain when we get out of here,” said Harry with \\na sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder \\nthan ever. \\n\\n“But — ” \\n\\n“Later,” Harry said shortly. He didn’t think it was a \\ngood idea to tell Ron yet who’d been opening the \\nChamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway. “Where’s \\nLockhart?” \\n\\n“Back there,” said Ron, still looking puzzled but \\njerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. “He’s \\nin a bad way. Come and see.” \\n\\nLed by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a \\nsoft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the \\nway back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart \\nwas sitting there, humming placidly to himself. \\n\\n“His memory’s gone,” said Ron. “The Memory Charm \\nbackfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn’t got a clue \\nwho he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to \\ncome and wait here. He’s a danger to himself.” \\n\\nLockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all. \\n\\n“Hello,” he said. “Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it? Do \\nyou live here?” \\n\\n“No,” said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry. \\n\\nHarry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe. \\n\\n“Have you thought how we’re going to get back up \\nthis?” he said to Ron. \\n\\nPage | 361 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had \\nswooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of \\nhim, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He was waving \\nhis long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly \\nat him. \\n\\n“He looks like he wants you to grab hold ...” said Ron, \\nlooking perplexed. “But you’re much too heavy for a \\nbird to pull up there — ” \\n\\n“Fawkes,” said Harry, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” He \\nturned quickly to the others. “We’ve got to hold on to \\neach other. Ginny, grab Ron’s hand. Professor \\nLockhart — ” \\n\\n“He means you,” said Ron sharply to Lockhart. \\n\\n“You hold Ginny’s other hand — ” \\n\\nHarry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his \\nbelt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry’s robes, and \\nHarry reached out and took hold of Fawkes’s \\nstrangely hot tail feathers. \\n\\nAn extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through \\nhis whole body and the next second, in a rush of \\nwings, they were flying upward through the pipe. \\nHarry could hear Lockhart dangling below him, \\nsaying, “Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!” \\nThe chill air was whipping through Harry’s hair, and \\nbefore he’d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over — \\nall four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning \\nMyrtle’s bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his \\nhat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into \\nplace. \\n\\nMyrtle goggled at them. \\n\\n“You’re alive,” she said blankly to Harry. \\n\\nPage | 362 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s no need to sound so disappointed,” he said \\ngrimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his \\nglasses. \\n\\n“Oh, well ... I’d just been thinking ... if you had died, \\nyou’d have been welcome to share my toilet,” said \\nMyrtle, blushing silver. \\n\\n“Urgh!” said Ron as they left the bathroom for the \\ndark, deserted corridor outside. “Harry! I think \\nMyrtle’s grown fond of you! You’ve got competition, \\nGinny!” \\n\\nBut tears were still flooding silently down Ginny’s \\nface. \\n\\n“Where now?” said Ron, with an anxious look at \\nGinny. Harry pointed. \\n\\nFawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the \\ncorridor. They strode after him, and moments later, \\nfound themselves outside Professor McGonagall’s \\noffice. \\n\\nHarry knocked and pushed the door open. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 363 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDOBBY’S REWARD \\n\\nFor a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, \\n\\nGinny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in \\nmuck and slime and (in Harry’s case) blood. Then \\nthere was a scream. \\n\\n“Ginny\\\\” \\n\\nIt was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in \\nfront of the fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed \\nby Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on \\ntheir daughter. \\n\\nHarry, however, was looking past them. Professor \\nDumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, \\nbeaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was \\ntaking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. \\nFawkes went whooshing past Harry’s ear and settled \\non Dumbledore ’s shoulder, just as Harry found \\nhimself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight \\nembrace. \\n\\n“You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?” \\n\\nPage | 364 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“I think we’d all like to know that,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall weakly. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a \\nmoment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon \\nit the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and \\nwhat remained of Riddle’s diary. \\n\\nThen he started telling them everything. For nearly a \\nquarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He \\ntold them about hearing the disembodied voice, how \\nHermione had finally realized that he was hearing a \\nbasilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed \\nthe spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them \\nwhere the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he \\nhad guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the \\nvictim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of \\nSecrets might be in her bathroom. ... \\n\\n“Very well,” Professor McGonagall prompted him as \\nhe paused, “so you found out where the entrance was \\n— breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along \\nthe way, I might add — but how on earth did you all \\nget out of there alive, Potter?” \\n\\nSo Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this \\ntalking, told them about Fawkes’s timely arrival and \\nabout the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then \\nhe faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle’s \\ndiary — or Ginny. She was standing with her head \\nagainst Mrs. Weasley ’s shoulder, and tears were still \\ncoursing silently down her cheeks. What if they \\nexpelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle’s diary \\ndidn’t work anymore. ... How could they prove it had \\nbeen he who’d made her do it all? \\n\\nInstinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who \\nsmiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon \\nspectacles. \\n\\nPage | 365 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K.

En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny ’s not \\n... Ginny hasn’t been ... has she?” \\n\\n“It was this diary,” said Harry quickly, picking it up \\nand showing it to Dumbledore. “Riddle wrote it when \\nhe was sixteen. ...” \\n\\nDumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered \\nkeenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and \\nsoggy pages. \\n\\n“Brilliant,” he said softly. “Of course, he was probably \\nthe most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.” \\n\\nHe turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking \\nutterly bewildered. \\n\\n“Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once \\ncalled Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years \\nago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the \\nschool . . . traveled far and wide . . . sank so deeply into \\nthe Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our \\nkind, underwent so many dangerous, magical \\ntransformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord \\nVoldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone \\nconnected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome \\nboy who was once Head Boy here.” \\n\\n“But, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What’s our Ginny \\ngot to do with — with — him?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 366 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“His d-diary!” Ginny sobbed. “I’ve b-been writing in it, \\nand he’s been w- writing back all year — ” \\n\\n“Ginnyl” said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. “Haven’t I \\ntaught you anything ? What have I always told you? \\nNever trust anything that can think for itself if you \\ncan’t see where it keeps its brain. Why didn’t you \\nshow the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious \\nobject like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic — ” \\n\\n“I d-didn’t know,” sobbed Ginny. “I found it inside one \\nof the books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had \\njust left it in there and forgotten about it — ” \\n\\n“Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right \\naway,” Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. “This \\nhas been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no \\npunishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have \\nbeen hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.” He strode over \\nto the door and opened it. “Bed rest and perhaps a \\nlarge, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find \\nthat cheers me up,” he added, twinkling kindly down \\nat her. “You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still \\nawake. She’s just giving out Mandrake juice — I \\ndaresay the basilisk’s victims will be waking up any \\nmoment.” \\n\\n“So Hermione’s okay!” said Ron brightly. \\n\\n“There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,” said \\nDumbledore. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley \\nfollowed, still looking deeply shaken. \\n\\n“You know, Minerva,” Professor Dumbledore said \\nthoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, “I think all this \\nmerits a good feast Might I ask you to go and alert \\nthe kitchens?” \\n\\nPage | 367 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Right,” said Professor McGonagall crisply, also \\nmoving to the door. “Ill leave you to deal with Potter \\nand Weasley, shall I?” \\n\\n“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\nShe left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at \\nDumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall \\nmeant, deal with them? Surely — surely — they \\nweren’t about to be punished? \\n\\n“I seem to remember telling you both that I would \\nhave to expel you if you broke any more school rules,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. \\n\\nRon opened his mouth in horror. \\n\\n“Which goes to show that the best of us must \\nsometimes eat our words,” Dumbledore went on, \\nsmiling. “You will both receive Special Awards for \\nServices to the School and — let me see — yes, I think \\ntwo hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.” \\n\\nRon went as brightly pink as Lockhart’s valentine \\nflowers and closed his mouth again. \\n\\n“But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet \\nabout his part in this dangerous adventure,” \\nDumbledore added. “Why so modest, Gilderoy?” \\n\\nHarry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about \\nLockhart. He turned and saw that Lockhart was \\nstanding in a corner of the room, still wearing his \\nvague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him, \\nLockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was \\ntalking to. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 368 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore,” Ron said quickly, “there was \\nan accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. \\nProfessor Lockhart — ” \\n\\n“Am I a professor?” said Lockhart in mild surprise. \\n“Goodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?” \\n\\n“He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand \\nbackfired,” Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Dear me,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his \\nlong silver mustache quivering. “Impaled upon your \\nown sword, Gilderoy!” \\n\\n“Sword?” said Lockhart dimly. “Haven’t got a sword. \\nThat boy has, though.” He pointed at Harry. “He’ll \\nlend you one.” \\n\\n“Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the \\ninfirmary, too?” Dumbledore said to Ron. “I’d like a \\nfew more words with Harry. ...” \\n\\nLockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at \\nDumbledore and Harry as he closed the door. \\n\\nDumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire. \\n\\n“Sit down, Harry,” he said, and Harry sat, feeling \\nunaccountably nervous. \\n\\n“First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,” said \\nDumbledore, eyes twinkling again. “You must have \\nshown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing \\nbut that could have called Fawkes to you.” \\n\\nHe stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down \\nonto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as \\nDumbledore watched him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 369 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And so you met Tom Riddle,” said Dumbledore \\nthoughtfully. “I imagine he was most interested in \\nyou. ...” \\n\\nSuddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came \\ntumbling out of his mouth. \\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I’m like him. \\nStrange likenesses, he said. ...” \\n\\n“ Did he, now?” said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully \\nat Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows. “And \\nwhat do you think, Harry?” \\n\\n“I don’t think I’m like him!” said Harry, more loudly \\nthan he’d intended. “I mean, I’m — I’m in Gryffindor, \\nI’m ...” \\n\\nBut he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his \\nmind. \\n\\n“Professor,” he started again after a moment. “The \\nSorting Hat told me I’d — I’d have done well in \\nSlytherin. Everyone thought / was Slytherin’s heir for \\na while ... because I can speak Parseltongue. ...” \\n\\n“You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said \\nDumbledore calmly, “because Lord Voldemort — who \\nis the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin \\n— can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much \\nmistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to \\nyou the night he gave you that scar. Not something he \\nintended to do, I’m sure. ...” \\n\\n“Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said, \\nthunderstruck. \\n\\n“It certainly seems so.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 370 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking \\ndesperately into Dumbledore ’s face. “The Sorting Hat \\ncould see Slytherin ’s power in me, and it — ” \\n\\n“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. \\n“Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many \\nqualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked \\nstudents. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — \\nresourcefulness — determination — a certain \\ndisregard for rules,” he added, his mustache \\nquivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in \\nGryffindor. You know why that was. Think.” \\n\\n“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a \\ndefeated voice, “because I asked not to go in \\nSlytherin. ...” \\n\\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more. \\n“Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It \\nis our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far \\nmore than our abilities.” Harry sat motionless in his \\nchair, stunned. “If you want proof, Harry, that you \\nbelong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely \\nat this.” \\n\\nDumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall’s \\ndesk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and \\nhanded it to Harry. Dully, Harry turned it over, the \\nrubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the \\nname engraved just below the hilt. \\n\\nGodric Gryffindor. \\n\\n“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of \\nthe hat, Harry,” said Dumbledore simply. \\n\\nFor a minute, neither of them spoke. Then \\nDumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 371 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall’s desk and took out a quill and \\na bottle of ink. \\n\\n“What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I \\nsuggest you go down to the feast, while I write to \\nAzkaban — we need our gamekeeper back. And I \\nmust draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, \\ntoo,” he added thoughtfully. “Well be needing a new \\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher. ... Dear me, \\nwe do seem to run through them, don’t we?” \\n\\nHarry got up and crossed to the door. He had just \\nreached for the handle, however, when the door burst \\nopen so violently that it bounced back off the wall. \\n\\nLucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And \\ncowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in \\nbandages, was Dobby. \\n\\n“Good evening, Lucius,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. \\n\\nMr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept \\ninto the room. Dobby went scurrying in after him, \\ncrouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject \\nterror on his face. \\n\\nThe elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was \\nattempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoy ’s shoes. \\nApparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, \\nfor not only were his shoes half-polished, but his \\nusually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf \\nbobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his \\ncold eyes upon Dumbledore. \\n\\n“So!” he said “You’ve come back. The governors \\nsuspended you, but you still saw fit to return to \\nHogwarts.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 372 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, you see, Lucius,” said Dumbledore, smiling \\nserenely, “the other eleven governors contacted me \\ntoday. It was something like being caught in a \\nhailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They’d heard that \\nArthur Weasley’s daughter had been killed and \\nwanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I \\nwas the best man for the job after all. Very strange \\ntales they told me, too. ... Several of them seemed to \\nthink that you had threatened to curse their families \\nif they didn’t agree to suspend me in the first place.” \\n\\nMr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes \\nwere still slits of fury. \\n\\n“So — have you stopped the attacks yet?” he sneered. \\n“Have you caught the culprit?” \\n\\n“We have,” said Dumbledore, with a smile. \\n\\n“Well?” said Mr. Malfoy sharply. “Who is it?” \\n\\n“The same person as last time, Lucius,” said \\nDumbledore. “But this time, Lord Voldemort was \\nacting through somebody else. By means of this \\ndiary.” \\n\\nHe held up the small black book with the large hole \\nthrough the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. \\nHarry, however, was watching Dobby. \\n\\nThe elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes \\nfixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the \\ndiary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself \\nhard on the head with his fist. \\n\\n“I see ...” said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore. \\n\\n“A clever plan,” said Dumbledore in a level voice, still \\nstaring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. “Because if \\n\\nPage | 373 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry here” — Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp \\nlook — “and his friend Ron hadn’t discovered this \\nbook, why — Ginny Weasley might have taken all the \\nblame. No one would ever have been able to prove she \\nhadn’t acted of her own free will. ...” \\n\\nMr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly \\nmasklike. \\n\\n“And imagine,” Dumbledore went on, “what might \\nhave happened then. ... The Weasleys are one of our \\nmost prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the \\neffect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection \\nAct, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and \\nkilling Muggle-borns. ... Very fortunate the diary was \\ndiscovered, and Riddle’s memories wiped from it. Who \\nknows what the consequences might have been \\notherwise. ...” \\n\\nMr. Malfoy forced himself to speak. \\n\\n“Very fortunate,” he said stiffly. \\n\\nAnd still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first \\nto the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching \\nhimself in the head. \\n\\nAnd Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at \\nDobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting \\nhis ears in punishment. \\n\\n“Don’t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that \\ndiary, Mr. Malfoy?” said Harry. \\n\\nLucius Malfoy rounded on him. \\n\\n“How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold \\nof it?” he said. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 374 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Because you gave it to her,” said Harry. “In Flourish \\nand Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration \\nbook and slipped the diary inside it, didn’t you?” \\n\\nHe saw Mr. Malfoy’s white hands clench and \\nunclench. \\n\\n“Prove it,” he hissed. \\n\\n“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said Dumbledore, \\nsmiling at Harry. “Not now that Riddle has vanished \\nfrom the book. On the other hand, I would advise you, \\nLucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord \\nVoldemort’s old school things. If any more of them \\nfind their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur \\nWeasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back \\nto you. ...” \\n\\nLucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry \\ndistinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was \\nlonging to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to \\nhis house-elf. \\n\\n“We’re going, Dobby!” \\n\\nHe wrenched open the door and as the elf came \\nhurrying up to him, he kicked him right through it. \\nThey could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the \\nway along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, \\nthinking hard. Then it came to him — \\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore,” he said hurriedly. “Can I give \\nthat diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?” \\n\\n“Certainly, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly. “But \\nhurry. The feast, remember. ...” \\n\\nHarry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. \\nHe could hear Dobby’s squeals of pain receding \\n\\nPage | 375 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naround the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan \\ncould possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, \\npulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary \\ninto it. Then he ran down the dark corridor. \\n\\nHe caught up with them at the top of the stairs. \\n\\n“Mr. Malfoy,” he gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got \\nsomething for you — ” \\n\\nAnd he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy’s \\nhand. \\n\\n“What the — ?” \\n\\nMr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it \\naside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to \\nHarry. \\n\\n“You’ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one \\nof these days, Harry Potter,” he said softly. “They were \\nmeddlesome fools, too.” \\n\\nHe turned to go. \\n\\n“Come, Dobby. I said, come.” \\n\\nBut Dobby didn’t move. He was holding up Harry’s \\ndisgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it \\nwere a priceless treasure. \\n\\n“Master has given a sock,” said the elf in wonderment. \\n“Master gave it to Dobby.” \\n\\n“What’s that?” spat Mr. Malfoy. “What did you say?” \\n\\n“Got a sock,” said Dobby in disbelief. “Master threw it, \\nand Dobby caught it, and Dobby — Dobby is free.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 376 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he \\nlunged at Harry. \\n\\n“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!” \\n\\nBut Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry \\nPotter!” \\n\\nThere was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown \\nbackward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a \\ntime, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing \\nbelow. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his \\nwand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger. \\n\\n“You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at \\nMr. Malfoy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You \\nshall go now.” \\n\\nLucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed \\nstare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around \\nhim and hurried out of sight. \\n\\n“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing \\nup at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window \\nreflected in his orb-like eyes. “Harry Potter set Dobby \\nfree!” \\n\\n“Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning. “Just \\npromise never to try and save my life again.” \\n\\nThe elf’s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, \\ntoothy smile. \\n\\n“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said Harry as \\nDobby pulled on Harry’s sock with shaking hands. \\n“You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who- \\nMust-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 377 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was a clue, sir,” said Dobby, his eyes widening, as \\nthough this was obvious. “Was giving you a clue. The \\nDark Lord, before he changed his name, could be \\nfreely named, you see?” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry weakly. “Well, I’d better go. There’s \\na feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by \\nnow. ...” \\n\\nDobby threw his arms around Harry’s middle and \\nhugged him. \\n\\n“Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” he \\nsobbed. “Farewell, Harry Potter!” \\n\\nAnd with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared. \\n\\nHarry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never \\none quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, \\nand the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn’t know \\nwhether the best bit was Hermione running toward \\nhim, screaming “You solved it! You solved it!” or \\nJustin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to \\nwring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting \\nhim, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing \\nHarry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they \\nwere knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and \\nRon’s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the \\nHouse Cup for the second year running, or Professor \\nMcGonagall standing up to tell them all that the \\nexams had been canceled as a school treat (“Oh, no!” \\nsaid Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, \\nunfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to \\nreturn next year, owing to the fact that he needed to \\ngo away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the \\nteachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news. \\n\\n“Shame,” said Ron, helping himself to a jam \\ndoughnut. “He was starting to grow on me.” \\n\\nPage | 378 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing \\nsunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a \\nfew, small differences — Defense Against the Dark \\nArts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had plenty of \\npractice at that anyway,” Ron told a disgruntled \\nHermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a \\nschool governor. Draco was no longer strutting \\naround the school as though he owned the place. On \\nthe contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the \\nother hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy \\nagain. \\n\\nToo soon, it was time for the journey home on the \\nHogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, \\nGeorge, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. \\nThey made the most of the last few hours in which \\nthey were allowed to do magic before the holidays. \\nThey played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of \\nFred and George’s Filibuster fireworks, and practiced \\ndisarming each other by magic. Harry was getting \\nvery good at it. \\n\\nThey were almost at King’s Cross when Harry \\nremembered something. \\n\\n“Ginny — what did you see Percy doing, that he didn’t \\nwant you to tell anyone?” \\n\\n“Oh, that,” said Ginny, giggling. “Well — Percy’s got a \\ngirlfriend.” \\n\\nFred dropped a stack of books on George’s head. \\n“What?” \\n\\n“It’s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,” \\nsaid Ginny. “That’s who he was writing to all last \\nsummer. He’s been meeting her all over the school in \\nsecret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty \\n\\nPage | 379 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclassroom one day. He was so upset when she was — \\nyou know — attacked. You won’t tease him, will you?” \\nshe added anxiously. \\n\\n“Wouldn’t dream of it,” said Fred, who was looking \\nlike his birthday had come early. \\n\\n“Definitely not,” said George, sniggering. \\n\\nThe Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped. \\n\\nHarry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and \\nturned to Ron and Hermione. \\n\\n“This is called a telephone number,” he told Ron, \\nscribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and \\nhanding it to them. “I told your dad how to use a \\ntelephone last summer — he’ll know. Call me at the \\nDursleys’, okay? I can’t stand another two months \\nwith only Dudley to talk to. ...” \\n\\n“Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won’t \\nthey?” said Hermione as they got off the train and \\njoined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted \\nbarrier. “When they hear what you did this year? \\n\\n“Proud?” said Harry. “Are you crazy? All those times I \\ncould’ve died, and I didn’t manage it? They’ll be \\nfurious. ...” \\n\\nAnd together they walked back through the gateway \\nto the Muggle world. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 380 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling'"
