He was waiting for \\na call from the President of a far distant country, and \\nbetween wondering when the wretched man would \\ntelephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant \\nmemories of what had been a very long, tiring, and \\ndifficult week, there was not much space in his head \\nfor anything else. The more he attempted to focus on \\nthe print on the page before him, the more clearly the \\nPrime Minister could see the gloating face of one of \\nhis political opponents. This particular opponent had \\nappeared on the news that very day, not only to \\nenumerate all the terrible things that had happened \\nin the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) \\nbut also to explain why each and every one of them \\nwas the government’s fault. \\n\\nThe Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very \\nthought of these accusations, for they were neither \\nfair nor true. How on earth was his government \\n\\nPage | 2 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nsupposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It \\nwas outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were \\nnot spending enough on bridges. The bridge was \\nfewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at \\na loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, \\nsending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the \\nriver below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was \\nlack of policemen that had resulted in those two very \\nnasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the \\ngovernment should have somehow foreseen the freak \\nhurricane in the West Country that had caused so \\nmuch damage to both people and property? And was \\nit his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert \\nChorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly \\nthat he was now going to be spending a lot more time \\nwith his family? \\n\\n“A grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent \\nhad concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin. \\n\\nAnd unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime \\nMinister felt it himself; people really did seem more \\nmiserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; \\nall this chilly mist in the middle of July. ... It wasn’t \\nright, it wasn’t normal. ... \\n\\nHe turned over the second page of the memo, saw \\nhow much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad \\njob. Stretching his arms above his head he looked \\naround his office mournfully. It was a handsome \\nroom, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash \\nwindows, firmly closed against the unseasonable \\nchill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up \\nand moved over to the window, looking out at the thin \\nmist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was \\nthen, as he stood with his back to the room, that he \\nheard a soft cough behind him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 3 \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking \\nreflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He \\nhad heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the \\nempty room. \\n\\n“Hello?” he said, trying to sound braver than he felt. \\n\\nFor a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible \\nhope that nobody would answer him. However, a \\nvoice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that \\nsounded as though it were reading a prepared \\nstatement. It was coming — as the Prime Minister \\nhad known at the first cough — from the froglike little \\nman wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a \\nsmall, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room. \\n\\n“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. \\nKindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.” \\n\\nThe man in the painting looked inquiringly at the \\nPrime Minister. \\n\\n“Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen. ... It’s not a very \\ngood time for me. ... I’m waiting for a telephone call, \\nyou see . . . from the President of — ” \\n\\n“That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. \\nThe Prime Minister’s heart sank. He had been afraid \\nof that. \\n\\n“But I really was rather hoping to speak — ” \\n\\n“We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. \\n\\nHe will telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the \\nlittle man. “Kindly respond immediately to Mr. \\n\\nFudge.” \\n\\n“I ... oh ... very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. \\n“Yes, I’ll see Fudge.” \\n\\nPage | 4 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as \\nhe went. He had barely resumed his seat, and \\narranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed \\nand unfazed expression, when bright green flames \\nburst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble \\nmantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker \\nof surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within \\nthe flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, \\nhe had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, \\nbrushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped \\ncloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand. \\n\\n“Ah ... Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding \\nforward with his hand outstretched. “Good to see you \\nagain.” \\n\\nThe Prime Minister could not honestly return this \\ncompliment, so said nothing at all. He was not \\nremotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional \\nappearances, apart from being downright alarming in \\nthemselves, generally meant that he was about to \\nhear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was \\nlooking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, \\nand grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The \\nPrime Minister had seen that kind of look in \\npoliticians before, and it never boded well. \\n\\n“How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand \\nvery briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the \\nchairs in front of the desk. \\n\\n“Difficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge, \\npulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his \\ngreen bowler upon his knees. “What a week, what a \\nweek ...” \\n\\n“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime \\nMinister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 5 \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquite enough on his plate already without any extra \\nhelpings from Fudge. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily \\nand looking morosely at the Prime Minister. “I’ve been \\nhaving the same week you have, Prime Minister. The \\nBrockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... \\nnot to mention the ruckus in the West Country ...” \\n\\n“You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your \\npeople were — were involved in those — those things, \\nwere they?” \\n\\nFudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern \\nlook. “Of course they were,” he said. “Surely you’ve \\nrealized what’s going on?” \\n\\n“I ...” hesitated the Prime Minister. \\n\\nIt was precisely this sort of behavior that made him \\ndislike Fudge’s visits so much. He was, after all, the \\nPrime Minister and did not appreciate being made to \\nfeel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had \\nbeen like this from his very first meeting with Fudge \\non his very first evening as Prime Minister. He \\nremembered it as though it were yesterday and knew \\nit would haunt him until his dying day. \\n\\nHe had been standing alone in this very office, \\nsavoring the triumph that was his after so many \\nyears of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard \\na cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to \\nfind that ugly little portrait talking to him, \\nannouncing that the Minister of Magic was about to \\narrive and introduce himself. \\n\\nNaturally, he had thought that the long campaign and \\nthe strain of the election had caused him to go mad. \\nHe had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking \\n\\nPage | 6 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto him, though this had been nothing to how he felt \\nwhen a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the \\nfireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained \\nspeechless throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation \\nthat there were witches and wizards still living in \\nsecret all over the world and his reassurances that he \\nwas not to bother his head about them as the \\nMinistry of Magic took responsibility for the whole \\nWizarding community and prevented the non-magical \\npopulation from getting wind of them. It was, said \\nFudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything \\nfrom regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to \\nkeeping the dragon population under control (the \\nPrime Minister remembered clutching the desk for \\nsupport at this point). Fudge had then patted the \\nshoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a \\nfatherly sort of way. \\n\\n“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never \\nsee me again. I’ll only bother you if there’s something \\nreally serious going on our end, something that’s \\nlikely to affect the Muggles — the non-magical \\npopulation, I should say. Otherwise, it’s live and let \\nlive. And I must say, you’re taking it a lot better than \\nyour predecessor. He tried to throw me out the \\nwindow, thought I was a hoax planned by the \\nopposition.” \\n\\nAt this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. \\n“You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?” \\n\\nIt had been his last, desperate hope. \\n\\n“No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.” \\n\\nAnd he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a \\ngerbil. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 7 \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching \\nhis teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, \\n“but why — why has nobody told me — ?” \\n\\n“The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to \\nthe Muggle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, \\npoking his wand back inside his jacket. “We find it \\nthe best way to maintain secrecy.” \\n\\n“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a \\nformer Prime Minister warned me — ?” \\n\\nAt this, Fudge had actually laughed. \\n\\n“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell \\nanybody?” \\n\\nStill chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into \\nthe fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and \\nvanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime \\nMinister had stood there, quite motionless, and \\nrealized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare \\nmention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the \\nwide world would believe him? \\n\\nThe shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a \\ntime, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had \\nindeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of \\nsleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain \\nattempt to rid himself of all reminders of this \\nuncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to \\nhis delighted niece and instructed his private \\nsecretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little \\nman who had announced Fudge’s arrival. To the \\nPrime Minister’s dismay, however, the portrait had \\nproved impossible to remove. When several \\ncarpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the \\nChancellor of the Exchequer had all tried \\nunsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime \\nPage | 8 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMinister had abandoned the attempt and simply \\nresolved to hope that the thing remained motionless \\nand silent for the rest of his term in office. \\nOccasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the \\ncorner of his eye the occupant of the painting \\nyawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or \\ntwice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving \\nnothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. \\nHowever, he had trained himself not to look at the \\npicture very much, and always to tell himself firmly \\nthat his eyes were playing tricks on him when \\nanything like this happened. \\n\\nThen, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the \\nPrime Minister had been alone in his office when the \\nportrait had once again announced the imminent \\narrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, \\nsopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. \\nBefore the Prime Minister could ask why he was \\ndripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started \\nranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never \\nheard of, a man named “Serious” Black, something \\nthat sounded like “Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry \\nPotter, none of which made the remotest sense to the \\nPrime Minister. \\n\\n\"... Fve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted, \\ntipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his \\nbowler hat into his pocket. “Middle of the North Sea, \\nyou know, nasty flight . . . the dementors are in \\nuproar” — he shuddered — “they’ve never had a \\nbreakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime \\nMinister. Black’s a known Muggle killer and may be \\nplanning to rejoin You-Know-Who. ... But of course, \\nyou don’t even know who You-Know-Who is!” He had \\ngazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, \\nthen said, “Well, sit down, sit down, I’d better fill you \\nin. ... Have a whiskey ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 9 \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit \\ndown in his own office, let alone offered his own \\nwhiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out \\nhis wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber \\nliquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the \\nPrime Minister’s hand, and drew up a chair. \\n\\nFudge had talked for more than an hour. At one \\npoint, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and \\nwrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he \\nhad thrust into the Prime Minister’s whiskey-free \\nhand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the \\nPrime Minister had stood up too. \\n\\n“So you think that ...” He had squinted down at the \\nname in his left hand. “Lord Vol — ” \\n\\n“ He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\\\” snarled Fudge. \\n\\n“I’m sorry. ... You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be- \\nNamed is still alive, then?” \\n\\n“Well, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had \\nfastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, “but \\nwe’ve never found him. If you ask me, he’s not \\ndangerous unless he’s got support, so it’s Black we \\nought to be worrying about. You’ll put out that \\nwarning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don’t see \\neach other again, Prime Minister! Good night.” \\n\\nBut they had seen each other again. Less than a year \\nlater a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of \\nthin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime \\nMinister that there had been a spot of bother at the \\nKwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) \\nWorld Cup and that several Muggles had been \\n“involved,” but that the Prime Minister was not to \\nworry, the fact that You-Know- Who’s Mark had been \\nseen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an \\nPage | 10 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nisolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was \\ndealing with all memory modifications as they spoke. \\n\\n“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added. “We’re \\nimporting three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the \\nTriwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the \\nDepartment for the Regulation and Control of Magical \\nCreatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that \\nwe have to notify you if we’re bringing highly \\ndangerous creatures into the country.” \\n\\n“I — what — dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister. \\n\\n“Yes, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. Well, good \\nday to you.” \\n\\nThe Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that \\ndragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but \\nno. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out \\nof the fire yet again, this time with the news that \\nthere had been a mass breakout from Azkaban. \\n\\n“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister \\nhoarsely. \\n\\n“No need to worry, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge, \\nalready with one foot in the flames. “We’ll have them \\nrounded up in no time — just thought you ought to \\nknow!” \\n\\nAnd before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait \\njust one moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of \\ngreen sparks. \\n\\nWhatever the press and the opposition might say, the \\nPrime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not \\nescaped his notice that, despite Fudge’s assurances \\nat their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a \\nlot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more \\nPage | 11 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nflustered with each visit. Little though he liked to \\nthink about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always \\ncalled Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the \\nPrime Minister could not help but fear that the next \\ntime Fudge appeared it would be with graver news \\nstill. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the \\nfire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and \\nsternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not \\nknow exactly why he was there, was about the worst \\nthing that had happened in the course of this \\nextremely gloomy week. \\n\\n“How should I know what’s going on in the — er — \\nWizarding community?” snapped the Prime Minister \\nnow. “I have a country to run and quite enough \\nconcerns at the moment without — ” \\n\\n“We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted. \\n\\n“The Brockdale Bridge didn’t wear out. That wasn’t \\nreally a hurricane. Those murders were not the work \\nof Muggles. And Herbert Chorley’s family would be \\nsafer without him. We are currently making \\narrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo’s \\nHospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move \\nshould be effected tonight.” \\n\\n“What do you ... I’m afraid I ... What?” blustered the \\nPrime Minister. \\n\\nFudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime \\nMinister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he’s \\nback. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.” \\n\\n“Back? When you say ‘back’ ... he’s alive? I mean — ” \\n\\nThe Prime Minister groped in his memory for the \\ndetails of that horrible conversation of three years \\npreviously, when Fudge had told him about the \\nwizard who was feared above all others, the wizard \\n\\nPage | 12 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwho had committed a thousand terrible crimes before \\nhis mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier. \\n\\n“Yes, alive,” said Fudge. “That is — I don’t know — is \\na man alive if he can’t be killed? I don’t really \\nunderstand it, and Dumbledore won’t explain \\nproperly — but anyway, he’s certainly got a body and \\nis walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for \\nthe purposes of our discussion, yes, he’s alive.” \\n\\nThe Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, \\nbut a persistent habit of wishing to appear well- \\ninformed on any subject that came up made him cast \\naround for any details he could remember of their \\nprevious conversations. \\n\\n“Is Serious Black with — er — He-Who-Must-Not-Be- \\nNamed?” \\n\\n“Black? Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his \\nbowler rapidly in his fingers. “Sirius Black, you \\nmean? Merlin’s beard, no. Black’s dead. Turns out we \\nwere — er — mistaken about Black. He was innocent \\nafter all. And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-Must- \\nNot-Be-Named either. I mean,” he added defensively, \\nspinning the bowler hat still faster, “all the evidence \\npointed — we had more than fifty eyewitnesses — but \\nanyway, as I say, he’s dead. Murdered, as a matter of \\nfact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There’s going to \\nbe an inquiry, actually. ...” \\n\\nTo his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting \\nstab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, \\neclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at \\nthe thought that, deficient though he himself might \\nbe in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there \\nhad never been a murder in any of the government \\ndepartments under his charge. ... Not yet, anyway ... \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 13 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the \\nwood of his desk, Fudge continued, “But Black’s by- \\nthe-by now. The point is, we’re at war, Prime Minister, \\nand steps must be taken.” \\n\\n“At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously. \\n“Surely that’s a little bit of an overstatement?” \\n\\n“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by \\nthose of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in \\nJanuary,” said Fudge, speaking more and more \\nrapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a \\nlime-green blur. “Since they have moved into the \\nopen, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale \\nBridge — he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a \\nmass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and \\n\\n\\n\\n“Good grief, so it’s your fault those people were killed \\nand I’m having to answer questions about rusted \\nrigging and corroded expansion joints and I don’t \\nknow what else!” said the Prime Minister furiously. \\n\\n“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up. “Are you saying \\nyou would have caved in to blackmail like that?” \\n\\n“Maybe not,” said the Prime Minister, standing up \\nand striding about the room, “but I would have put all \\nmy efforts into catching the blackmailer before he \\ncommitted any such atrocity!” \\n\\n“Do you really think I wasn’t already making every \\neffort?” demanded Fudge heatedly. “Every Auror in \\nthe Ministry was — and is — trying to find him and \\nround up his followers, but we happen to be talking \\nabout one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a \\nwizard who has eluded capture for almost three \\ndecades!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 14 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the \\nhurricane in the West Country too?” said the Prime \\nMinister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It \\nwas infuriating to discover the reason for all these \\nterrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, \\nalmost worse than it being the government’s fault \\nafter all. \\n\\n“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably. \\n\\n“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now \\npositively stamping up and down. “Trees uprooted, \\nroofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries — ” \\n\\n“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must- \\nNot-Be-Named’s followers. And ... and we suspect \\ngiant involvement.” \\n\\nThe Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though \\nhe had hit an invisible wall. “ What involvement?” \\n\\nFudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he \\nwanted to go for the grand effect,” he said. “The Office \\nof Misinformation has been working around the clock, \\nwe’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify \\nthe memories of all the Muggles who saw what really \\nhappened, we’ve got most of the Department for the \\nRegulation and Control of Magical Creatures running \\naround Somerset, but we can’t find the giant — it’s \\nbeen a disaster.” \\n\\n“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously. \\n\\n“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the \\nMinistry,” said Fudge. “What with all that, and then \\nlosing Amelia Bones.” \\n\\n“Losing who?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 15 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical \\nLaw Enforcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- \\nNamed may have murdered her in person, because \\nshe was a very gifted witch and — and all the \\nevidence was that she put up a real fight.” \\n\\nFudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it \\nseemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat. \\n\\n“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the \\nPrime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. \\n“Our newspapers. Amelia Bones ... it just said she \\nwas a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a — \\na nasty killing, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of \\npublicity. The police are baffled, you see.” \\n\\nFudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. \\n“Killed in a room that was locked from the inside, \\nwasn’t she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who \\ndid it, not that that gets us any further toward \\ncatching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, \\nmaybe you didn’t hear about that one — ” \\n\\n“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened \\njust around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. \\nThe papers had a field day with it, ‘breakdown of law \\nand order in the Prime Minister’s backyard — ’ ” \\n\\n“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, barely \\nlistening to the Prime Minister, “we’ve got dementors \\nswarming all over the place, attacking people left, \\nright, and center. ...” \\n\\nOnce upon a happier time this sentence would have \\nbeen unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was \\nwiser now. \\n\\n“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in \\nAzkaban,” he said cautiously. \\n\\nPage | 16 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore. \\nThey’ve deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must- \\nNot-Be-Named. I won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.” \\n\\n“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of \\ndawning horror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the \\ncreatures that drain hope and happiness out of \\npeople?” \\n\\n“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s \\ncausing all this mist.” \\n\\nThe Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the \\nnearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping \\nthrough the towns and countryside, spreading \\ndespair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel \\nquite faint. \\n\\n“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something! \\nIt’s your responsibility as Minister of Magic!” \\n\\n“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m \\nstill Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked \\nthree days ago! The whole Wizarding community has \\nbeen screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I’ve \\nnever known them so united in my whole term of \\noffice!” said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile. \\n\\nThe Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. \\nDespite his indignation at the position into which he \\nhad been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken- \\nlooking man sitting opposite him. \\n\\n“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I \\ncan do?” \\n\\n“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is \\nnothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to \\ndate on recent events and to introduce you to my \\n\\nPage | 17 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsuccessor. I rather thought he’d be here by now, but \\nof course, he’s very busy at the moment, with so \\nmuch going on.” \\n\\nFudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little \\nman wearing the long curly silver wig, who was \\ndigging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching \\nFudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be here in a \\nmoment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the \\nfirst time. “I’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a \\nday for the past fortnight, but he won’t budge. If he’d \\njust been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still \\nbe ... Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more \\nsuccess.” \\n\\nFudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved \\nsilence, but it was broken almost immediately by the \\nportrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official \\nvoice. \\n\\n“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a \\nmeeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus \\nScrimgeour, Minister of Magic.” \\n\\n“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, \\nand he barely flinched as the flames in the grate \\nturned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a \\nsecond spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him \\nmoments later onto the antique rug. \\n\\nFudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, \\nthe Prime Minister did the same, watching the new \\narrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, \\nand look around. \\n\\nThe Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that \\nRufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. \\n\\nPage | 18 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair \\nand his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes \\nbehind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain \\nrangy, loping grace even though he walked with a \\nslight limp. There was an immediate impression of \\nshrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister \\nthought he understood why the Wizarding community \\npreferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these \\ndangerous times. \\n\\n“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, \\nholding out his hand. \\n\\nScrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the \\nroom, then pulled out a wand from under his robes. \\n\\n“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over \\nto the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. \\nThe Prime Minister heard the lock click. \\n\\n“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t \\nmind, I’d rather that door remained unlocked.” \\n\\n“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour \\nshortly, “or watched,” he added, pointing his wand at \\nthe windows, so that the curtains swept across them. \\n“Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to \\nbusiness. First of all, we need to discuss your \\nsecurity.” \\n\\nThe Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest \\nheight and replied, “I am perfectly happy with the \\nsecurity I’ve already got, thank you very — ” \\n\\n“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor \\nlookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets \\nput under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in \\nyour outer office — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 19 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Tm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s \\nwhat you’re suggesting!” said the Prime Minister \\nhotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets through twice the \\nwork the rest of them — ” \\n\\n“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, \\nwithout a flicker of a smile. “A highly trained Auror, \\nwho has been assigned to you for your protection.” \\n\\n“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. \\n“You can’t just put your people into my office, I decide \\nwho works for me — ” \\n\\n“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said \\nScrimgeour coldly. \\n\\n“I am — that’s to say, I was — ” \\n\\n“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour. \\n\\n“I ... well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to \\nbe ... er ... excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, \\nbut Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him. \\n\\n“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” \\nhe continued. “The one who has been entertaining the \\npublic by impersonating a duck.” \\n\\n“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister. \\n\\n“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed \\nImperius Curse,” said Scrimgeour. “It’s addled his \\nbrains, but he could still be dangerous.” \\n\\n“He’s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly. \\n“Surely a bit of a rest . . . Maybe go easy on the drink \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 20 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’s Hospital for \\nMagical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as \\nwe speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of \\nthem,” said Scrimgeour. “I think it best that we \\nremove him from Muggle society for a while.” \\n\\n“I ... well ... He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the \\nPrime Minister anxiously. \\n\\nScrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back \\ntoward the fireplace. \\n\\n“Well, that’s really all I had to say. I will keep you \\nposted of developments, Prime Minister — or, at least, \\nI shall probably be too busy to come personally, in \\nwhich case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented \\nto stay on in an advisory capacity.” \\n\\nFudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he \\nmerely looked as though he had a toothache. \\nScrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for \\nthe mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The \\nPrime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them \\nfor a moment, then the words he had fought to \\nsuppress all evening burst from him at last. \\n\\n“But for heaven’s sake — you’re wizards\\'. You can do \\nmagic ! Surely you can sort out — well — anything !” \\n\\nScrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged \\nan incredulous look with Fudge, who really did \\nmanage a smile this time as he said kindly, “The \\ntrouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime \\nMinister.” \\n\\nAnd with that, the two wizards stepped one after the \\nother into the bright green fire and vanished. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 21 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSPINNER’S END \\n\\nMany miles away the chilly mist that had pressed \\nagainst the Prime Minister’s windows drifted over a \\ndirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbish- \\nstrewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a \\ndisused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There \\nwas no sound apart from the whisper of the black \\nwater and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that \\nhad slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some \\nold fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass. \\n\\nBut then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure \\nappeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The \\nfox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new \\nphenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings \\nfor a few moments, then set off with light, quick \\nstrides, its long cloak rustling over the grass. \\n\\nWith a second and louder pop, another hooded figure \\nmaterialized. \\n\\n“Wait!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 22 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nThe harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost \\nflat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place \\nand up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a \\nyelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead. \\n\\nThe second figure turned over the animal with its toe. \\n\\n“Just a fox,” said a woman’s voice dismissively from \\nunder the hood. “I thought perhaps an Auror — \\n\\nCissy, wait!” \\n\\nBut her quarry, who had paused and looked back at \\nthe flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank \\nthe fox had just fallen down. \\n\\n“Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me — ” \\n\\nThe second woman caught the first and seized her \\narm, but the other wrenched it away. \\n\\n“Go back, Bella!” \\n\\n“You must listen to me!” \\n\\n“I’ve listened already. I’ve made my decision. Leave me \\nalone!” \\n\\nThe woman named Narcissa gained the top of the \\nbank, where a line of old railings separated the river \\nfrom a narrow, cobbled street. The other woman, \\n\\nBella, followed at once. Side by side they stood \\nlooking across the road at the rows and rows of \\ndilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and \\nblind in the darkness. \\n\\n“He lives here?” asked Bella in a voice of contempt. \\n“Here? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first \\nof our kind ever to set foot — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 23 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped \\nthrough a gap in the rusty railings and was already \\nhurrying across the road. \\n\\n“Cissy, wait\\\\” \\n\\nBella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw \\nNarcissa darting through an alley between the houses \\ninto a second, almost identical street. Some of the \\nstreetlamps were broken; the two women were \\nrunning between patches of light and deep darkness. \\nThe pursuer caught up with her prey just as she \\nturned another corner, this time succeeding in \\ncatching hold of her arm and swinging her around so \\nthat they faced each other. \\n\\n“Cissy, you must not do this, you can’t trust him — ” \\n\\n“The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn’t he?” \\n\\n“The Dark Lord is ... I believe ... mistaken,” Bella \\npanted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her \\nhood as she looked around to check that they were \\nindeed alone. “In any case, we were told not to speak \\nof the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark \\nLord’s — ” \\n\\n“Let go, Bella!” snarled Narcissa, and she drew a \\nwand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly \\nin the other’s face. Bella merely laughed. \\n\\n“Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn’t — ” \\n\\n“There is nothing I wouldn’t do anymore!” Narcissa \\nbreathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she \\nbrought down the wand like a knife, there was \\nanother flash of light. Bella let go of her sister’s arm \\nas though burned. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 24 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Narcisscd” \\n\\n\\n\\nBut Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, \\nher pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, \\nas they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of \\nbrick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street \\nnamed Spinner’s End, over which the towering mill \\nchimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory \\nfinger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she \\npassed boarded and broken windows, until she \\nreached the very last house, where a dim light \\nglimmered through the curtains in a downstairs \\nroom. \\n\\nShe had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing \\nunder her breath, had caught up. Together they stood \\nwaiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the \\ndirty river that was carried to them on the night \\nbreeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement \\nbehind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a \\nman could be seen looking out at them, a man with \\nlong black hair parted in curtains around a sallow \\nface and black eyes. \\n\\nNarcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that \\nshe seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde \\nhair streaming down her back gave her the look of a \\ndrowned person. \\n\\n“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little \\nwider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister \\ntoo. “What a pleasant surprise!” \\n\\n“Severus,” she said in a strained whisper. “May I \\nspeak to you? It’s urgent.” \\n\\n“But of course.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 25 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stood back to allow her to pass him into the \\nhouse. Her still-hooded sister followed without \\ninvitation. \\n\\n“Snape,” she said curtly as she passed him. \\n\\n“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a \\nslightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a \\nsnap behind them. \\n\\nThey had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, \\nwhich had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls \\nwere completely covered in books, most of them \\nbound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare \\nsofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood \\ngrouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a \\ncandle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place \\nhad an air of neglect, as though it was not usually \\ninhabited. \\n\\nSnape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off \\nher cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her \\nwhite and trembling hands clasped in her lap. \\n\\nBellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her \\nsister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong \\njaw, she did not take her gaze from Snape as she \\nmoved to stand behind Narcissa. \\n\\n“So, what can I do for you?” Snape asked, settling \\nhimself in the armchair opposite the two sisters. \\n\\n“We ... we are alone, aren’t we?” Narcissa asked \\nquietly. \\n\\n“Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail’s here, but we’re not \\ncounting vermin, are we?” \\n\\nHe pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him \\nand with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a \\n\\nPage | 26 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnarrow staircase upon which a small man stood \\nfrozen. \\n\\n“As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have \\nguests,” said Snape lazily. \\n\\nThe man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps \\nand moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, \\na pointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper. His \\nleft hand was caressing his right, which looked as \\nthough it was encased in a bright silver glove. \\n\\n“Narcissa!” he said, in a squeaky voice. “And Bellatrix! \\nHow charming — ” \\n\\n“Wormtail will get us drinks, if you’d like them,” said \\nSnape. “And then he will return to his bedroom.” \\n\\nWormtail winced as though Snape had thrown \\nsomething at him. \\n\\n“I am not your servant!” he squeaked, avoiding \\nSnape ’s eye. \\n\\n“Really? I was under the impression that the Dark \\nLord placed you here to assist me.” \\n\\n“To assist, yes — but not to make you drinks and — \\nand clean your house!” \\n\\n“I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more \\ndangerous assignments,” said Snape silkily. “This can \\nbe easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord — ” \\n\\n“I can speak to him myself if I want to!” \\n\\n“Of course you can,” said Snape, sneering. “But in the \\nmeantime, bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine \\nwill do.” \\n\\nPage | 27 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though \\nhe might argue, but then turned and headed through \\na second hidden door. They heard banging and a \\nclinking of glasses. Within seconds he was back, \\nbearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. \\nHe dropped these on the rickety table and scurried \\nfrom their presence, slamming the book-covered door \\nbehind him. \\n\\nSnape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and \\nhanded two of them to the sisters. Narcissa \\nmurmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said \\nnothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This did \\nnot seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he \\nlooked rather amused. \\n\\n“The Dark Lord,” he said, raising his glass and \\ndraining it. \\n\\nThe sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. \\n\\nAs Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush, \\n“Severus, I’m sorry to come here like this, but I had to \\nsee you. I think you are the only one who can help me \\n\\n\\n\\nSnape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his \\nwand again at the concealed staircase door. There \\nwas a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound \\nof Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs. \\n\\n“My apologies,” said Snape. “He has lately taken to \\nlistening at doors, I don’t know what he means by it. \\n\\n... You were saying, Narcissa?” \\n\\nShe took a great, shuddering breath and started \\nagain. \\n\\n“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been \\ntold to say nothing to anyone, but — ” \\n\\nPage | 28 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled \\nBellatrix. “Particularly in present company!” \\n\\n“ ‘Present company’?” repeated Snape sardonically. \\n“And what am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?” \\n\\n“That I don’t trust you, Snape, as you very well \\nknow!” \\n\\nNarcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry \\nsob and covered her face with her hands. Snape set \\nhis glass down upon the table and sat back again, his \\nhands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into \\nBellatrix’s glowering face. \\n\\n“Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is \\nbursting to say; it will save tedious interruptions. \\n\\nWell, continue, Bellatrix,” said Snape. “Why is it that \\nyou do not trust me?” \\n\\n“A hundred reasons!” she said loudly, striding out \\nfrom behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. \\n“Where to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord \\nfell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him \\nwhen he vanished? What have you been doing all \\nthese years that you’ve lived in Dumbledore’s pocket? \\nWhy did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the \\nSorcerer’s Stone? Why did you not return at once \\nwhen the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a \\nfew weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the \\nprophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is \\nHarry Potter still alive, when you have had him at \\nyour mercy for five years?” \\n\\nShe paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the \\ncolor high in her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat \\nmotionless, her face still hidden in her hands. \\n\\nSnape smiled. \\n\\nPage | 29 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Before I answer you — oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going \\nto answer! You can carry my words back to the others \\nwho whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of \\nmy treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I \\nsay, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think \\nthat the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every \\none of those questions? And do you really think that, \\nhad I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I \\nwould be sitting here talking to you?” \\n\\nShe hesitated. \\n\\n“I know he believes you, but ...” \\n\\n“You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow \\nhoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest \\nwizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world \\nhas ever seen?” \\n\\nBellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a \\nlittle discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He \\npicked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, \\n“You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was \\nwhere he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of \\nWitchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to \\nspy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, \\nthat it was on the Dark Lord’s orders that I took up \\nthe post?” \\n\\nShe nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened \\nher mouth, but Snape forestalled her. \\n\\n“You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he \\nvanished. For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the \\nCarrows, Greyback, Lucius” — he inclined his head \\nslightly to Narcissa — “and many others did not \\nattempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not \\nproud of it, I was wrong, but there it is. ... If he had \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 30 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would \\nhave very few followers left.” \\n\\n“He’d have me!” said Bellatrix passionately. “I, who \\nspent many years in Azkaban for him!” \\n\\n“Yes, indeed, most admirable,” said Snape in a bored \\nvoice. “Of course, you weren’t a lot of use to him in \\nprison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine — ” \\n\\n“Gesture!” she shrieked; in her fury she looked \\nslightly mad. “While I endured the dementors, you \\nremained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing \\nDumbledore’s pet!” \\n\\n“Not quite,” said Snape calmly. “He wouldn’t give me \\nthe Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. \\nSeemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse . . . \\ntempt me into my old ways.” \\n\\n“This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to \\nteach your favorite subject?” she jeered. “Why did you \\nstay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on \\nDumbledore for a master you believed dead?” \\n\\n“Hardly,” said Snape, “although the Dark Lord is \\npleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen \\nyears of information on Dumbledore to give him when \\nhe returned, a rather more useful welcome-back \\npresent than endless reminiscences of how \\nunpleasant Azkaban is. ...” \\n\\n“But you stayed — ” \\n\\n“Yes, Bellatrix, I stayed,” said Snape, betraying a hint \\nof impatience for the first time. “I had a comfortable \\njob that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were \\nrounding up the Death Eaters, you know. \\nDumbledore’s protection kept me out of jail; it was \\nPage | 31 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmost convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark \\nLord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see \\nwhy you do. \\n\\n“I think you next wanted to know,” he pressed on, a \\nlittle more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of \\ninterrupting, “why I stood between the Dark Lord and \\nthe Sorcerer’s Stone. That is easily answered. He did \\nnot know whether he could trust me. He thought, like \\nyou, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to \\nDumbledore’s stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, \\nvery weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He \\ndid not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally \\nmight turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I \\ndeeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have \\nreturned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw \\nonly greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal \\nthe stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.” \\n\\nBellatrix’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an \\nunpleasant dose of medicine. \\n\\n“But you didn’t return when he came back, you didn’t \\nfly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark \\nburn — ” \\n\\n“Correct. I returned two hours later. I returned on \\nDumbledore’s orders.” \\n\\n“On Dumbledore’s — ?” she began, in tones of \\noutrage. \\n\\n“Think!” said Snape, impatient again. “Think! By \\nwaiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured that I \\ncould remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing \\nDumbledore to think that I was only returning to the \\nDark Lord’s side because I was ordered to, I have \\nbeen able to pass information on Dumbledore and the \\nOrder of the Phoenix ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: \\nPage | 32 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Dark Mark had been growing stronger for \\nmonths. I knew he must be about to return, all the \\nDeath Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think \\nabout what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to \\nescape like Karkaroff, didn’t I? \\n\\n“The Dark Lord’s initial displeasure at my lateness \\nvanished entirely, I assure you, when I explained that \\nI remained faithful, although Dumbledore thought I \\nwas his man. Yes, the Dark Lord thought that I had \\nleft him forever, but he was wrong.” \\n\\n“But what use have you been?” sneered Bellatrix. \\n“What useful information have we had from you?” \\n\\n“My information has been conveyed directly to the \\nDark Lord,” said Snape. “If he chooses not to share it \\nwith you — ” \\n\\n“He shares everything with me!” said Bellatrix, firing \\nup at once. “He calls me his most loyal, his most \\nfaithful — ” \\n\\n“Does he?” said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to \\nsuggest his disbelief. “Does he still, after the fiasco at \\nthe Ministry?” \\n\\n“That was not my fault!” said Bellatrix, flushing. “The \\nDark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his \\nmost precious — if Lucius hadn’t — ” \\n\\n“Don’t you dare — don’t you dare blame my \\nhusband!” said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, \\nlooking up at her sister. \\n\\n“There is no point apportioning blame,” said Snape \\nsmoothly. “What is done, is done.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 33 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But not by you!” said Bellatrix furiously. “No, you \\nwere once again absent while the rest of us ran \\ndangers, were you not, Snape?” \\n\\n“My orders were to remain behind,” said Snape. \\n“Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps \\nyou think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if \\nI had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the \\nOrder of the Phoenix? And — forgive me — you speak \\nof dangers ... you were facing six teenagers, were you \\nnot?” \\n\\n“They were joined, as you very well know, by half of \\nthe Order before long!” snarled Bellatrix. “And, while \\nwe are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you \\ncannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters, \\ndon’t you?” \\n\\n“I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name \\nof the place. You understand how the enchantment \\nworks, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the \\ninformation I have passed him on the Order. It led, as \\nperhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and \\nmurder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped \\ndispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit \\nfor finishing him off.” \\n\\nHe inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression \\ndid not soften. \\n\\n“You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry \\nPotter. You could have killed him at any point in the \\npast five years. You have not done it. Why?” \\n\\n“Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?” \\nasked Snape. \\n\\n“He ... lately, we ... I am asking you, Snape!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 34 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could \\nnot have used his blood to regenerate, making him \\ninvincible — ” \\n\\n“You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she \\njeered. \\n\\n“I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have \\nalready confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. \\n\\nI am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is \\nnot sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year \\nago. ...” \\n\\n“But why did you keep him alive?” \\n\\n“Have you not understood me? It was only \\nDumbledore’s protection that was keeping me out of \\nAzkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite \\nstudent might have turned him against me? But there \\nwas more to it than that. I should remind you that \\nwhen Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still \\nmany stories circulating about him, rumors that he \\nhimself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he \\nhad survived the Dark Lord’s attack. Indeed, many of \\nthe Dark Lord’s old followers thought Potter might be \\na standard around which we could all rally once \\nmore. I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined \\nto murder him the moment he set foot in the castle. \\n\\n“Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly \\nthat he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has \\nfought his way out of a number of tight corners by a \\nsimple combination of sheer luck and more talented \\nfriends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as \\nobnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before \\nhim. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out \\nof Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but \\nkill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 35 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwould have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore \\nclose at hand.” \\n\\n“And through all this we are supposed to believe \\nDumbledore has never suspected you?” asked \\nBellatrix. “He has no idea of your true allegiance, he \\ntrusts you implicitly still?” \\n\\n“I have played my part well,” said Snape. “And you \\noverlook Dumbledore’s greatest weakness: He has to \\nbelieve the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest \\nremorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death \\nEater days, and he embraced me with open arms — \\nthough, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark \\nArts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a \\ngreat wizard — oh yes, he has,” (for Bellatrix had \\nmade a scathing noise), “the Dark Lord acknowledges \\nit. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is \\ngrowing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month \\nshook him. He has since sustained a serious injury \\nbecause his reactions are slower than they once were. \\nBut through all these years, he has never stopped \\ntrusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great \\nvalue to the Dark Lord.” \\n\\nBellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared \\nunsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking \\nadvantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister. \\n\\n“Now ... you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?” \\n\\nNarcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with \\ndespair. \\n\\n“Yes, Severus. I — I think you are the only one who \\ncan help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in \\njail and ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 36 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from \\nbeneath her eyelids. \\n\\n“The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,” \\nNarcissa continued, her eyes still closed. “He wishes \\nnone to know of the plan. It is ... very secret. But — ” \\n\\n“If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,” said \\nSnape at once. “The Dark Lord’s word is law.” \\n\\nNarcissa gasped as though he had doused her with \\ncold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time \\nsince she had entered the house. \\n\\n“There!” she said triumphantly to her sister. “Even \\nSnape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your \\nsilence!” \\n\\nBut Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the \\nsmall window, peered through the curtains at the \\ndeserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. \\n\\nHe turned around to face Narcissa, frowning. \\n\\n“It so happens that I know of the plan,” he said in a \\nlow voice. “I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. \\nNevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, \\n\\nNarcissa, you would have been guilty of great \\ntreachery to the Dark Lord.” \\n\\n“I thought you must know about it!” said Narcissa, \\nbreathing more freely. “He trusts you so, Severus. ...” \\n\\n“You know about the plan?” said Bellatrix, her fleeting \\nexpression of satisfaction replaced by a look of \\noutrage. “ You know?” \\n\\n“Certainly,” said Snape. “But what help do you \\nrequire, Narcissa? If you are imagining I can persuade \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 37 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is \\nno hope, none at all.” \\n\\n“Severus,” she whispered, tears sliding down her pale \\ncheeks. “My son ... my only son ...” \\n\\n“Draco should be proud,” said Bellatrix indifferently. \\n“The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor. And I \\nwill say this for Draco: He isn’t shrinking away from \\nhis duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, \\nexcited at the prospect — ” \\n\\nNarcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly \\nall the while at Snape. \\n\\n“That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what \\nlies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too \\ndangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius’s mistake, I \\nknow it!” \\n\\nSnape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of \\nher tears as though they were indecent, but he could \\nnot pretend not to hear her. \\n\\n“That’s why he’s chosen Draco, isn’t it?” she \\npersisted. “To punish Lucius?” \\n\\n“If Draco succeeds,” said Snape, still looking away \\nfrom her, “he will be honored above all others.” \\n\\n“But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa. “How can \\nhe, when the Dark Lord himself — ?” \\n\\nBellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve. \\n\\n“I only meant ... that nobody has yet succeeded. ... \\nSeverus ... please ... You are, you have always been, \\nDraco’s favorite teacher. ... You are Lucius’s old \\nfriend. ... I beg you. ... You are the Dark Lord’s \\n\\nPage | 38 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfavorite, his most trusted advisor. ... Will you speak to \\nhim, persuade him — ?” \\n\\n“The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not \\nstupid enough to attempt it,” said Snape flatly. “I \\ncannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with \\nLucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got \\nhimself captured, along with how many others, and \\nfailed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, \\nthe Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.” \\n\\n“Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!” \\nchoked Narcissa. “He does not mean him to succeed, \\nhe wants him to be killed trying!” \\n\\nWhen Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose \\nwhat little self-restraint she still possessed. Standing \\nup, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his \\nrobes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his \\nchest, she gasped, “You could do it. You could do it \\ninstead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of \\ncourse you would, and he would reward you beyond \\nall of us — ” \\n\\nSnape caught hold of her wrists and removed her \\nclutching hands. Looking down into her tears tained \\nface, he said slowly, “He intends me to do it in the \\nend, I think. But he is determined that Draco should \\ntry first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco \\nsucceeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little \\nlonger, fulfilling my useful role as spy.” \\n\\n“In other words, it doesn’t matter to him if Draco is \\nkilled!” \\n\\n“The Dark Lord is very angry,” repeated Snape \\nquietly. “He failed to hear the prophecy. You know as \\nwell as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 39 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and \\nmoaning on the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n“My only son ... my only son ...” \\n\\n“You should be proud!” said Bellatrix ruthlessly. “If I \\nhad sons, I would be glad to give them up to the \\nservice of the Dark Lord!” \\n\\nNarcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched \\nat her long blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by \\nthe arms, lifted her up, and steered her back onto the \\nsofa. He then poured her more wine and forced the \\nglass into her hand. \\n\\n“Narcissa, that’s enough. Drink this. Listen to me.” \\n\\nShe quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she \\ntook a shaky sip. \\n\\n“It might be possible ... for me to help Draco.” \\n\\nShe sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge. \\n\\n“Severus — oh, Severus — you would help him? \\n\\nWould you look after him, see he comes to no harm?” \\n\\n“I can try.” \\n\\nShe flung away her glass; it skidded across the table \\nas she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at \\nSnape ’s feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and \\npressed her lips to it. \\n\\n“If you are there to protect him ... Severus, will you \\nswear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?” \\n\\n“The Unbreakable Vow?” \\n\\nPage | 40 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnape’s expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, \\nhowever, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter. \\n\\n“Aren’t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he’ll try, I’m sure. \\n... The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of \\naction ... oh, on the Dark Lord’s orders, of course!” \\n\\nSnape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were \\nfixed upon Narcissa’s tear-filled blue ones as she \\ncontinued to clutch his hand. \\n\\n“Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable \\nVow,” he said quietly. “Perhaps your sister will \\nconsent to be our Bonder.” \\n\\nBellatrix’s mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so \\nthat he was kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath \\nBellatrix’s astonished gaze, they grasped right hands. \\n\\n“You will need your wand, Bellatrix,” said Snape \\ncoldly. \\n\\nShe drew it, still looking astonished. \\n\\n“And you will need to move a little closer,” he said. \\n\\nShe stepped forward so that she stood over them, and \\nplaced the tip of her wand on their linked hands. \\n\\nNarcissa spoke. \\n\\n“Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he \\nattempts to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes?” \\n\\n“I will,” said Snape. \\n\\nA thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand \\nand wound its way around their hands like a red-hot \\nwire. \\n\\nPage | 41 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him \\nfrom harm?” \\n\\n“I will,” said Snape. \\n\\nA second tongue of flame shot from the wand and \\ninterlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing \\nchain. \\n\\n“And, should it prove necessary ... if it seems Draco \\nwill fail ...” whispered Narcissa (Snape’s hand \\ntwitched within hers, but he did not draw away), “will \\nyou carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has \\nordered Draco to perform?” \\n\\nThere was a moment’s silence. Bellatrix watched, her \\nwand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide. \\n\\n“I will,” said Snape. \\n\\nBellatrix’s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a \\nthird tongue of flame, which shot from the wand, \\ntwisted with the others, and bound itself thickly \\naround their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery \\nsnake. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 42 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWILL AND WON’T \\n\\nHarry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting \\nin a chair beside his bedroom window for the best \\npart of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, \\nand had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face \\npressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses \\naskew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his \\nbreath had left on the window sparkled in the orange \\nglare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light \\ndrained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly \\nbeneath his shock of untidy black hair. \\n\\nThe room was strewn with various possessions and a \\ngood smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, \\nand sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of \\nspellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled \\nrobes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a \\npuddle of light on his desk. The headline of one \\nblared: \\n\\nHARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE? \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 43 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nRumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent \\ndisturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during which \\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted once more. \\n\\n“We’re not allowed to talk about it, don’t ask me \\nanything,” said one agitated Obliviator, who refused \\nto give his name as he left the Ministry last night. \\n\\nNevertheless, highly placed sources within the \\nMinistry have confirmed that the disturbance \\ncentered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy. \\n\\nThough Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused \\neven to confirm the existence of such a place, a \\ngrowing number of the Wizarding community believe \\nthat the Death Eaters now serving sentences in \\nAzkaban for trespass and attempted theft were \\nattempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that \\nprophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife \\nthat it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever \\nknown to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is \\nalso known to have been at the Ministry on the night \\nin question. Some are going so far as to call Potter \\n“the Chosen One,” believing that the prophecy names \\nhim as the only one who will be able to rid us of He- \\nWho-Must-Not-Be-Named. \\n\\nThe current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, \\nare unknown, although (ctd. page 2, column 5) \\n\\nA second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore \\nthe headline: \\n\\nSCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE \\n\\nMost of this front page was taken up with a large \\nblack-and-white picture of a man with a lionlike mane \\nof thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The picture \\nwas moving — the man was waving at the ceiling. \\n\\nPage | 44 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office \\nin the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has \\nsucceeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The \\nappointment has largely been greeted with \\nenthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though \\nrumors of a rift between the new Minister and Albus \\nDumbledore, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the \\nWizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour \\ntaking office. \\n\\nScrimgeour’s representatives admitted that he had met \\nwith Dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the \\ntop job, but refused to comment on the topics under \\ndiscussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to (ctd. page \\n3, column 2) \\n\\nTo the left of this paper sat another, which had been \\nfolded so that a story bearing the title MINISTRY \\nGUARANTEES STUDENTS’ SAFETY was visible. \\n\\nNewly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus \\nScrimgeour, spoke today of the tough new measures \\ntaken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students \\nreturning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and \\nWizardry this autumn. \\n\\n“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going \\ninto detail about its stringent new security plans,” \\nsaid the Minister, although an insider confirmed that \\nmeasures include defensive spells and charms, a \\ncomplex array of countercurses, and a small task \\nforce of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of \\nHogwarts School. \\n\\nMost seem reassured by the new Minister’s tough \\nstand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta \\nLongbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a good friend of \\nHarry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death \\nEaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and — \\nPage | 45 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the rest of this story was obscured by the large \\nbirdcage standing on top of it. Inside it was a \\nmagnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the \\nroom imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to \\ngaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she clicked \\nher beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep \\nto hear her. \\n\\nA large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its \\nlid was open; it looked expectant; yet it was almost \\nempty but for a residue of old underwear, sweets, \\nempty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the \\nvery bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet \\nemblazoned with the words: \\n\\n— ISSUED ON BEHALF OF — \\n\\nTHE MINISTRY OF MAGIC \\n\\nPROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY \\n\\nAGAINST DARK FORCES \\n\\nThe Wizarding community is currently under threat \\nfrom an organization calling itself the Death Eaters. \\nObserving the following simple security guidelines will \\nhelp protect you, your family, and your home from \\nattack. \\n\\n1. You are advised not to leave the house alone. \\n\\n2. Particular care should be taken during the \\nhours of darkness. Wherever possible, arrange to \\ncomplete journeys before night has fallen. \\n\\n3. Review the security arrangements around your \\nhouse, making sure that all family members are \\naware of emergency measures such as Shield and \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 46 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisillusionment Charms, and, in the case of underage \\nfamily members, Side-Along-Apparition. \\n\\n4. Agree on security questions with close friends \\nand family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading \\nas others by use of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2). \\n\\n5. Should you feel that a family member, \\ncolleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange \\nmanner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad \\nat once. They may have been put under the Imperius \\nCurse (see page 4). \\n\\n6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling \\nplace or other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact \\nthe Auror office immediately. \\n\\n7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death \\nEaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any \\nsighting of an Inferius, or encounter with same, \\nshould be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY. \\n\\nHarry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the \\nwindow an inch or so, making his glasses still more \\nlopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, \\nrepaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on \\nthe sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held \\nin place by Harry’s relaxed hand, was a piece of \\nparchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry \\nhad read this letter so often since its arrival three \\ndays ago that although it had been delivered in a \\ntightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat. \\n\\nDear Harry, \\n\\nIf it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, \\nPrivet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort \\nyou to the Burrow, where you have been invited to \\nspend the remainder of your school holidays. \\n\\nPage | 47 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your \\nassistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the \\nway to the Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when \\nI see you. \\n\\nKindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping \\nto see you this Friday, \\n\\nI am, yours most sincerely, \\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore \\n\\nThough he already knew it by heart, Harry had been \\nstealing glances at this missive every few minutes \\nsince seven o’clock that evening, when he had first \\ntaken up his position beside his bedroom window, \\nwhich had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet \\nDrive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading \\nDumbledore ’s words; Harry had sent back his “yes” \\nwith the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could \\ndo now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to \\ncome, or he was not. \\n\\nBut Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to \\nbe true that he was going to be rescued from the \\nDursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He \\ncould not shrug off the feeling that something was \\ngoing to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore ’s letter \\nmight have gone astray; Dumbledore could be \\nprevented from collecting him; the letter might turn \\nout not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or \\njoke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing \\nand then being let down and having to unpack again. \\nThe only gesture he had made to the possibility of a \\njourney was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in \\nher cage. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 48 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe minute hand on the alarm clock reached the \\nnumber twelve and, at that precise moment, the \\nstreetlamp outside the window went out. \\n\\nHarry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an \\nalarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and \\nunsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his \\nnose against the window instead and squinted down \\nat the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing \\ncloak was walking up the garden path. \\n\\nHarry jumped up as though he had received an \\nelectric shock, knocked over his chair, and started \\nsnatching anything and everything within reach from \\nthe floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he \\nlobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of \\ncrisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs \\nin the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, “Who \\nthe blazes is calling at this time of night?” \\n\\nHarry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a \\npair of trainers in the other. He had completely \\nforgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore \\nmight be coming. Feeling both panicky and close to \\nlaughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched \\nopen his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice \\nsay, “Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I \\ndaresay Harry has told you I would be coming for \\nhim?” \\n\\nHarry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an \\nabrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long \\nexperience had taught him to remain out of arm’s \\nreach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the \\ndoorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length \\nsilver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were \\nperched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a \\nlong black traveling cloak and a pointed hat. Vernon \\nDursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as \\nPage | 49 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore ’s, though black, and who was wearing a \\npuce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as \\nthough he could not believe his tiny eyes. \\n\\n“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did \\nnot warn you that I was coming,” said Dumbledore \\npleasantly. “However, let us assume that you have \\ninvited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to \\nlinger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.” \\n\\nHe stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the \\nfront door behind him. \\n\\n“It is a long time since my last visit,” said \\nDumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle \\nVernon. “I must say, your agapanthus are \\nflourishing.” \\n\\nVernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not \\ndoubt that speech would return to him, and soon — \\nthe vein pulsing in his uncle’s temple was reaching \\ndanger point — but something about Dumbledore \\nseemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It \\nmight have been the blatant wizardishness of his \\nappearance, but it might, too, have been that even \\nUncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom \\nit would be very difficult to bully. \\n\\n“Ah, good evening Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking \\nup at him through his half-moon glasses with a most \\nsatisfied expression. “Excellent, excellent.” \\n\\nThese words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was \\nclear that as far as he was concerned, any man who \\ncould look at Harry and say “excellent” was a man \\nwith whom he could never see eye to eye. \\n\\n“I don’t mean to be rude — ” he began, in a tone that \\nthreatened rudeness in every syllable. \\n\\nPage | 50 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ — yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly \\noften,” Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. \\n“Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this \\nmust be Petunia.” \\n\\nThe kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s \\naunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her \\nnightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre- \\nbedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her \\nrather horsey face registered nothing but shock. \\n\\n“Albus Dumbledore,” said Dumbledore, when Uncle \\nVernon failed to effect an introduction. “We have \\ncorresponded, of course.” Harry thought this an odd \\nway of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent \\nher an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not \\nchallenge the term. “And this must be your son, \\nDudley?” \\n\\nDudley had that moment peered round the living \\nroom door. His large, blond head rising out of the \\nstripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, \\nhis mouth gaping in astonishment and fear. \\nDumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to \\nsee whether any of the Dursleys were going to say \\nanything, but as the silence stretched on he smiled. \\n\\n“Shall we assume that you have invited me into your \\nsitting room? \\n\\nDudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore \\npassed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope and \\ntrainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed \\nDumbledore, who had settled himself in the armchair \\nnearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings \\nwith an expression of benign interest. He looked quite \\nextraordinarily out of place. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 51 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Aren’t — aren’t we leaving, sir?” Harry asked \\nanxiously. \\n\\n“Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we \\nneed to discuss first,” said Dumbledore. “And I would \\nprefer not to do so in the open. We shall trespass \\nupon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality only a little \\nlonger.” \\n\\n“You will, will you?” \\n\\nVernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his \\nshoulder, and Dudley skulking behind them both. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore simply, “I shall.” \\n\\nHe drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; \\nwith a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and \\nknocked the knees out from under all three of the \\nDursley s so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. \\nAnother flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back \\nto its original position. \\n\\n“We may as well be comfortable,” said Dumbledore \\npleasantly. \\n\\nAs he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that \\nhis hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as \\nthough his flesh had been burned away. \\n\\n“Sir — what happened to your — ?” \\n\\n“Later, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Please sit down.” \\n\\nHarry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to \\nlook at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into \\nsilence. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 52 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I would assume that you were going to offer me \\nrefreshment,” Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, “but \\nthe evidence so far suggests that that would be \\noptimistic to the point of foolishness.” \\n\\nA third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five \\nglasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and \\npoured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid \\ninto each of the glasses, which then floated to each \\nperson in the room. \\n\\n“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said \\nDumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught \\nhold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted \\nanything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The \\nDursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, \\ntried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, \\nas they were nudging them gently on the sides of their \\nheads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that \\nDumbledore was rather enjoying himself. \\n\\n“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, turning toward him, \\n“a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able \\nto solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the \\nPhoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius’s \\nwill was discovered a week ago and that he left you \\neverything he owned.” \\n\\nOver on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but \\nHarry did not look at him, nor could he think of \\nanything to say except, “Oh. Right.” \\n\\n“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” \\nDumbledore went on. “You add a reasonable amount \\nof gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit \\nall of Sirius’s personal possessions. The slightly \\nproblematic part of the legacy — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 53 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from \\nthe sofa. Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look \\nat him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite \\ninsistently on the side of Vernon’s head; he attempted \\nto beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he \\nhad not confided in the Dursleys. “Our problem,” he \\ncontinued to Harry, as if there had been no \\ninterruption, “is that Sirius also left you number \\ntwelve, Grimmauld Place.” \\n\\n“He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, \\nhis small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him. \\n\\n“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry. \\n\\n“I don’t care. You can have it, I don’t really want it.” \\nHarry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, \\nGrimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought \\nhe would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius \\nprowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned \\nwithin the place he had wanted so desperately to \\nleave. \\n\\n“That is generous,” said Dumbledore. “We have, \\nhowever, vacated the building temporarily.” \\n\\n“Why?” \\n\\n“Well,” said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of \\nUncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly \\nover the head by the persistent glass of mead, “Black \\nfamily tradition decreed that the house was handed \\ndown the direct line, to the next male with the name \\nof ‘Black. ’ Sirius was the very last of the line as his \\nyounger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both \\nwere childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain \\nthat he wants you to have the house, it is \\nnevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment \\nPage | 54 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhas been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot \\nbe owned by anyone other than a pureblood.” \\n\\n\\n\\nA vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of \\nSirius’s mother that hung in the hall of number \\ntwelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry’s mind. “I \\nbet there has,” he said. \\n\\n“Quite,” said Dumbledore. “And if such an \\nenchantment exists, then the ownership of the house \\nis most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living \\nrelatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix \\nLestrange.” \\n\\nWithout realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to \\nhis feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled \\nacross the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius’s killer, \\ninherit his house? \\n\\n“No,” he said. \\n\\n“Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn’t get it \\neither,” said Dumbledore calmly. “The situation is \\nfraught with complications. We do not know whether \\nthe enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, \\nfor example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that \\nownership has passed from Sirius’s hands. It might \\nbe that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any \\nmoment. Naturally we had to move out until such \\ntime as we have clarified the position.” \\n\\n“But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to \\nown it?” \\n\\n“Fortunately,” said Dumbledore, “there is a simple \\ntest.” \\n\\nHe placed his empty glass on a small table beside his \\nchair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle \\n\\nPage | 55 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVernon shouted, “ Will you get these ruddy things off \\nus?” \\n\\nHarry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were \\ncowering with their arms over their heads as their \\nglasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their \\ncontents flying everywhere. \\n\\n“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Dumbledore politely, and he \\nraised his wand again. All three glasses vanished. \\n\\n“But it would have been better manners to drink it, \\nyou know.” \\n\\nIt looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with \\nany number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely \\nshrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and \\nDudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes \\non Dumbledore ’s wand. \\n\\n“You see,” Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry \\nand again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not \\nuttered, “if you have indeed inherited the house, you \\nhave also inherited — ” \\n\\nHe flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud \\ncrack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a \\nnose, giant bat’s ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, \\ncrouching on the Dursleys’ shag carpet and covered \\nin grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising \\nshriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in \\nliving memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet \\noff the floor and sat with them raised almost above \\nhis head, as though he thought the creature might \\nrun up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon \\nbellowed, “What the hell is that?” \\n\\n“Kreacher,” finished Dumbledore. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 56 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t!” \\ncroaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle \\nVernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling \\nhis ears. “Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, \\nKreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his \\nnew mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, \\nKreacher won’t, won’t, won’t — ” \\n\\n“As you can see, Harry,” said Dumbledore loudly, over \\nKreacher’s continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,” \\n“Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into \\nyour ownership.” \\n\\n“I don’t care,” said Harry again, looking with disgust \\nat the writhing, stamping house-elf. “I don’t want \\nhim.” \\n\\n“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — ” \\n\\n“You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of \\nBellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived \\nat the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for \\nthe past year?” \\n\\n“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — ” \\n\\nHarry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher \\ncould not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix \\nLestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having \\nresponsibility for the creature that had betrayed \\nSirius, was repugnant. \\n\\n“Give him an order,” said Dumbledore. “If he has \\npassed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If \\nnot, then we shall have to think of some other means \\nof keeping him from his rightful mistress.” \\n\\n“Won’t, won’t, won’t, WON’T.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 57 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKreacher’s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could \\nthink of nothing to say, except, “Kreacher, shut up!” \\n\\nIt looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going \\nto choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still \\nworking furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few \\nseconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face \\nforward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) \\nand beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving \\nhimself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum. \\n\\n“Well, that simplifies matters,” said Dumbledore \\ncheerfully. “It seems that Sirius knew what he was \\ndoing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, \\nGrimmauld Place and of Kreacher.” \\n\\n“Do I — do I have to keep him with me?” Harry asked, \\naghast, as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet. \\n\\n“Not if you don’t want to,” said Dumbledore. “If I \\nmight make a suggestion, you could send him to \\nHogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, \\nthe other house-elves could keep an eye on him.” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Harry in relief, “yeah, I’ll do that. Er — \\nKreacher — I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in \\nthe kitchens there with the other house-elves.” \\n\\nKreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his \\narms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down \\nlook of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, \\nvanished. \\n\\n“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of \\nthe hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking \\nafter him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours \\nnow, so if you would prefer to make different \\narrangements — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 58 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I \\nthink Buckbeak would prefer that.” \\n\\n“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. \\n“He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, \\nwe have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak’s \\nsafety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time \\nbeing, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever \\nguess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to \\ndeath. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?” \\n\\n“Erm ...” \\n\\n“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore \\nsuggested shrewdly. \\n\\n“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, \\nhurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers. \\n\\nIt took him a little over ten minutes to track down \\neverything he needed; at last he had managed to \\nextract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, \\nscrewed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, \\nand forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. \\nThen, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding \\nHedwig’s cage in the other, he made his way back \\ndownstairs. \\n\\nHe was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was \\nnot waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to \\nreturn to the living room. \\n\\nNobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming \\nquietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the \\natmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry \\ndid not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, \\n\\n“Professor — I’m ready now.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 59 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Just one last thing, then.” \\nAnd he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more. \\n\\n“As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in \\na year’s time — ” \\n\\n“No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time \\nsince Dumbledore’s arrival. \\n\\n“I’m sorry?” said Dumbledore politely. \\n\\n“No, he doesn’t. He’s a month younger than Dudley, \\nand Dudders doesn’t turn eighteen until the year after \\nnext.” \\n\\n“Ah,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but in the \\nWizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.” \\n\\nUncle Vernon muttered, “Preposterous,” but \\nDumbledore ignored him. \\n\\n“Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord \\nVoldemort has returned to this country. The \\nWizarding community is currently in a state of open \\nwarfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already \\nattempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even \\ngreater danger now than the day when I left him upon \\nyour doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter \\nexplaining about his parents’ murder and expressing \\nthe hope that you would care for him as though he \\nwere your own.” \\n\\nDumbledore paused, and although his voice remained \\nlight and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, \\nHarry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and \\nnoticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer \\ntogether. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 60 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You did not do as I asked. You have never treated \\nHarry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect \\nand often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be \\nsaid is that he has at least escaped the appalling \\ndamage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy \\nsitting between you.” \\n\\nBoth Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around \\ninstinctively, as though expecting to see someone \\nother than Dudley squeezed between them. \\n\\n“Us — mistreat Dudders? What d’you — ?” began \\nUncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his \\nfinger for silence, a silence which fell as though he \\nhad struck Uncle Vernon dumb. \\n\\n“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that \\nHarry has powerful protection while he can still call \\nthis house ‘home.’ However miserable he has been \\nhere, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you \\nhave at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. \\nThis magic will cease to operate the moment that \\nHarry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment \\nhe becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow \\nHarry to return, once more, to this house, before his \\nseventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the \\nprotection continues until that time.” \\n\\nNone of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was \\nfrowning slightly, as though he was still trying to \\nwork out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle \\nVernon looked as though he had something stuck in \\nhis throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed. \\n\\n“Well, Harry ... time for us to be off,” said Dumbledore \\nat last, standing up and straightening his long black \\ncloak. “Until we meet again,” he said to the Dursleys, \\nwho looked as though that moment could wait forever \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 61 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas far as they were concerned, and after doffing his \\nhat, he swept from the room. \\n\\n“Bye,” said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed \\nDumbledore, who paused beside Harry’s trunk, upon \\nwhich Hedwig’s cage was perched. \\n\\n“We do not want to be encumbered by these just \\nnow,” he said, pulling out his wand again. “I shall \\nsend them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I \\nwould like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just \\nin case.” \\n\\nHarry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some \\ndifficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess \\nwithin. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket \\nof his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the \\ntrunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then \\nwaved his wand again, and the front door opened \\nonto cool, misty darkness. \\n\\n“And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and \\npursue that flighty temptress, adventure.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 62 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHORACE SLUGHORN \\n\\nDespite the fact that he had spent every waking \\nmoment of the past few days hoping desperately that \\nDumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry \\nfelt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet \\nDrive together. He had never had a proper \\nconversation with the headmaster outside of \\nHogwarts before; there was usually a desk between \\nthem. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter \\nkept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry’s \\nsense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that \\noccasion, not to mention done his best to smash \\nseveral of Dumbledore ’s most prized possessions. \\n\\nDumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed. \\n\\n“Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,” he said \\nbrightly. \\n\\n“But I thought I’m not allowed to use magic outside \\nschool, sir?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 63 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“If there is an attack,” said Dumbledore, “I give you \\npermission to use any counterjinx or curse that might \\noccur to you. However, I do not think you need worry \\nabout being attacked tonight.” \\n\\n“Why not, sir?” \\n\\n“You are with me,” said Dumbledore simply. “This will \\ndo, Harry.” \\n\\nHe came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive. \\n\\n“You have not, of course, passed your Apparition \\nTest,” he said. \\n\\n“No,” said Harry. “I thought you had to be seventeen?” \\n\\n“You do,” said Dumbledore. “So you will need to hold \\non to my arm very tightly. My left, if you don’t mind — \\nas you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at \\nthe moment.” \\n\\nHarry gripped Dumbledore’s proffered forearm. \\n\\n“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Well, here we go.” \\n\\nHarry felt Dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and \\nredoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything \\nwent black; he was being pressed very hard from all \\ndirections; he could not breathe, there were iron \\nbands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were \\nbeing forced back into his head; his eardrums were \\nbeing pushed deeper into his skull and then — \\n\\nHe gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened \\nhis streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just \\nbeen forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a \\nfew seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had \\nvanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in \\nPage | 64 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhat appeared to be a deserted village square, in the \\ncenter of which stood an old war memorial and a few \\nbenches. His comprehension catching up with his \\nsenses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for \\nthe first time in his life. \\n\\n“Are you all right?” asked Dumbledore, looking down \\nat him solicitously. “The sensation does take some \\ngetting used to.” \\n\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as \\nthough they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. \\n“But I think I might prefer brooms. ...” \\n\\nDumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little \\nmore tightly around his neck, and said, “This way.” \\n\\nHe set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a \\nfew houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, \\nit was almost midnight. \\n\\n“So tell me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Your scar ... \\nhas it been hurting at all?” \\n\\nHarry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead \\nand rubbed the lightning-shaped mark. \\n\\n“No,” he said, “and IVe been wondering about that. I \\nthought it would be burning all the time now \\nVoldemort’s getting so powerful again.” \\n\\nHe glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was \\nwearing a satisfied expression. \\n\\n“I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,” said \\nDumbledore. “Lord Voldemort has finally realized the \\ndangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you \\nhave been enjoying. It appears that he is now \\nemploying Occlumency against you.” \\n\\nPage | 65 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, I’m not complaining,” said Harry, who missed \\nneither the disturbing dreams nor the startling \\nflashes of insight into Voldemort’s mind. \\n\\nThey turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a \\nbus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore \\nagain. “Professor?” \\n\\n“Harry?” \\n\\n“Er — where exactly are we?” \\n\\n“This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh \\nBabberton.” \\n\\n“And what are we doing here?” \\n\\n“Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said \\nDumbledore. “Well, I have lost count of the number of \\ntimes I have said this in recent years, but we are, \\nonce again, one member of staff short. We are here to \\npersuade an old colleague of mine to come out of \\nretirement and return to Hogwarts.” \\n\\n“How can I help with that, sir?” \\n\\n“Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you,” said Dumbledore \\nvaguely. “Left here, Harry.” \\n\\nThey proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with \\nhouses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that \\nhad lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here \\ntoo. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over his \\nshoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his \\npocket. \\n\\n“Professor, why couldn’t we just Apparate directly into \\nyour old colleague’s house?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 66 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down \\nthe front door,” said Dumbledore. “Courtesy dictates \\nthat we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying \\nus entry. In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are \\nmagically protected from unwanted Apparators. At \\nHogwarts, for instance — ” \\n\\n“ — you can’t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings \\nor grounds,” said Harry quickly. “Hermione Granger \\ntold me.” \\n\\n“And she is quite right. We turn left again.” \\n\\nThe church clock chimed midnight behind them. \\n\\nHarry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it \\nrude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that \\nconversation had been established, he had more \\npressing questions to ask. \\n\\n“Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been \\nsacked. ...” \\n\\n“Correct,” said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep \\nside street. “He has been replaced, as I am sure you \\nalso saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head \\nof the Auror office.” \\n\\n“Is he ... Do you think he’s good?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“An interesting question,” said Dumbledore. “He is \\nable, certainly. A more decisive and forceful \\npersonality than Cornelius.” \\n\\n“Yes, but I meant — ” \\n\\n“I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action \\nand, having fought Dark wizards for most of his \\nworking life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 67 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything \\nabout the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the \\nDaily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the \\nnerve to pursue the subject, so he changed it. “And ... \\nsir ... I saw about Madam Bones.” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore quietly. “A terrible loss. She \\nwas a great witch. Just up here, I think — ouch.” \\n\\nHe had pointed with his injured hand. \\n\\n“Professor, what happened to your — ?” \\n\\n“I have no time to explain now,” said Dumbledore. “It \\nis a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.” \\n\\nHe smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not \\nbeing snubbed, and that he had permission to keep \\nasking questions. \\n\\n“Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about \\nsecurity measures we should all take against the \\nDeath Eaters. ...” \\n\\n“Yes, I received one myself,” said Dumbledore, still \\nsmiling. “Did you find it useful?” \\n\\n“Not really.” \\n\\n“No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for \\ninstance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check \\nthat I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an \\nimpostor.” \\n\\n“I didn’t ...” Harry began, not entirely sure whether he \\nwas being reprimanded or not. \\n\\n“For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry ... \\nalthough of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would \\n\\nPage | 68 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhave been sure to research my own jam preferences \\nbefore impersonating myself.” \\n\\n“Er ... right,” said Harry. “Well, on that leaflet, it said \\nsomething about Inferi. What exactly are they? The \\nleaflet wasn’t very clear.” \\n\\n“They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Dead \\nbodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark \\nwizard’s bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long \\ntime, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful. \\n\\n. . . He killed enough people to make an army of them, \\nof course. This is the place, Harry, just here. ...” \\n\\nThey were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its \\nown garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible \\nidea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything \\nelse, but as they reached the front gate, Dumbledore \\nstopped dead and Harry walked into him. \\n\\n“Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.” \\n\\nHarry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front \\npath and felt his heart sink. The front door was \\nhanging off its hinges. \\n\\nDumbledore glanced up and down the street. It \\nseemed quite deserted. \\n\\n“Wand out and follow me, Harry,” he said quietly. \\n\\nHe opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up \\nthe garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the \\nfront door very slowly, his wand raised and at the \\nready. \\n\\n“Lumos.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 69 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore ’s wand tip ignited, casting its light up a \\nnarrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open. \\nHolding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore \\nwalked into the sitting room with Harry right behind \\nhim. \\n\\nA scene of total devastation met their eyes. A \\ngrandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face \\ncracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a \\ndropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys \\nstrewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen \\nchandelier glittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, \\nfeathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments \\nof glass and china lay like powder over everything. \\nDumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its \\nlight was thrown upon the walls, where something \\ndarkly red and glutinous was spattered over the \\nwallpaper. Harry’s small intake of breath made \\nDumbledore look around. \\n\\n“Not pretty, is it?” he said heavily. “Yes, something \\nhorrible has happened here.” \\n\\nDumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the \\nroom, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry \\nfollowed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might \\nsee hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the \\noverturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body. \\n\\n“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him \\noff, Professor?” Harry suggested, trying not to imagine \\nhow badly wounded a man would have to be to leave \\nthose stains spattered halfway up the walls. \\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore quietly, peering \\nbehind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side. \\n\\n“You mean he’s — ?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 70 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Still here somewhere? Yes.” \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging \\nthe tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed \\narmchair, which yelled, “Ouch!” \\n\\n“Good evening, Horace,” said Dumbledore, \\nstraightening up again. \\n\\nHarry’s jaw dropped. Where a split second before \\nthere had been an armchair, there now crouched an \\nenormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his \\nlower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an \\naggrieved and watery eye. \\n\\n“There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,” \\nhe said gruffly, clambering to his feet. “It hurt.” \\n\\nThe wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his \\nprominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike \\nmustache, and the highly polished buttons on the \\nmaroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of \\nlilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached \\nDumbledore ’s chin. \\n\\n“What gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to \\nhis feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed \\nremarkably unabashed for a man who had just been \\ndiscovered pretending to be an armchair. \\n\\n“My dear Horace,” said Dumbledore, looking amused, \\n“if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark \\nMark would have been set over the house.” \\n\\nThe wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast \\nforehead. \\n\\n“The Dark Mark,” he muttered. “Knew there was \\nsomething ... ah well. Wouldn’t have had time \\n\\nPage | 71 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nanyway, I’d only just put the finishing touches to my \\nupholstery when you entered the room.” \\n\\nHe heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his \\nmustache flutter. \\n\\n“Would you like my assistance clearing up?” asked \\nDumbledore politely. \\n\\n“Please,” said the other. \\n\\nThey stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the \\nshort round one, and waved their wands in one \\nidentical sweeping motion. \\n\\nThe furniture flew back to its original places; \\nornaments reformed in midair, feathers zoomed into \\ntheir cushions; torn books repaired themselves as \\nthey landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared \\nonto side tables and reignited; a vast collection of \\nsplintered silver picture frames flew glittering across \\nthe room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon \\na desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, \\nand the walls wiped themselves clean. \\n\\n“What kind of blood was that, incidentally?” asked \\nDumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly \\nunsmashed grandfather clock. \\n\\n“On the walls? Dragon,” shouted the wizard called \\nHorace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, \\nthe chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling. \\n\\nThere was a final plunk from the piano, and silence. \\n\\n“Yes, dragon,” repeated the wizard conversationally. \\n“My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the \\nmoment. Still, it might be reusable.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 72 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on \\ntop of a sideboard and held it up to the light, \\nexamining the thick liquid within. \\n\\n“Hmm. Bit dusty.” \\n\\nHe set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It \\nwas then that his gaze fell upon Harry. \\n\\n“Oho,” he said, his large round eyes flying to Harry’s \\nforehead and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. “Ohol” \\n\\n“This,” said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the \\nintroduction, “is Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old \\nfriend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.” \\n\\nSlughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression \\nshrewd. “So that’s how you thought you’d persuade \\nme, is it? Well, the answer’s no, Albus.” \\n\\nHe pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely \\naway with the air of a man trying to resist temptation. \\n\\n“I suppose we can have a drink, at least?” asked \\nDumbledore. “For old time’s sake?” \\n\\nSlughorn hesitated. \\n\\n“All right then, one drink,” he said ungraciously. \\n\\nDumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward \\na chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so \\nrecently impersonated, which stood right beside the \\nnewly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. \\nHarry took the seat with the distinct impression that \\nDumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as \\nvisible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had \\nbeen busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face \\nthe room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry. \\nPage | 73 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hmpf,” he said, looking away quickly as though \\nfrightened of hurting his eyes. “Here — ” He gave a \\ndrink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without \\ninvitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank \\ninto the cushions of the repaired sofa and a \\ndisgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did \\nnot touch the floor. \\n\\n“Well, how have you been keeping, Horace?” \\nDumbledore asked. \\n\\n“Not so well,” said Slughorn at once. “Weak chest. \\nWheezy. Rheumatism too. Can’t move like I used to. \\nWell, that’s to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.” \\n\\n“And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to \\nprepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. “You can’t have had more than \\nthree minutes’ warning?” \\n\\nSlughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, “Two. \\n\\nDidn’t hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a \\nbath. Still,” he added sternly, seeming to pull himself \\nback together again, “the fact remains that I’m an old \\nman, Albus. A tired old man who’s earned the right to \\na quiet life and a few creature comforts.” \\n\\nHe certainly had those, thought Harry, looking \\naround the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet \\nnobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were \\nsoft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of \\nchocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not \\nknown who lived there, he would have guessed at a \\nrich, fussy old lady. \\n\\n“You’re not yet as old as I am, Horace,” said \\nDumbledore. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 74 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement \\nyourself,” said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry \\neyes had found Dumbledore ’s injured hand. \\n\\n“Reactions not what they were, I see.” \\n\\n“You’re quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely, \\nshaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those \\nburned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made \\nthe back of Harry’s neck prickle unpleasantly. “I am \\nundoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other \\nhand ...” \\n\\nHe shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to \\nsay that age had its compensations, and Harry \\nnoticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had \\nnever seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, \\nrather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and \\nwas set with a heavy black stone that had cracked \\ndown the middle. Slughorn’s eyes lingered for a \\nmoment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown \\nmomentarily crease his wide forehead. \\n\\n“So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace \\n... are they for the Death Eaters’ benefit, or mine?” \\nasked Dumbledore. \\n\\n“What would the Death Eaters want with a poor \\nbroken-down old buffer like me?” demanded \\nSlughorn. \\n\\n“I imagine that they would want you to turn your \\nconsiderable talents to coercion, torture, and \\nmurder,” said Dumbledore. “Are you really telling me \\nthat they haven’t come recruiting yet?” \\n\\nSlughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, \\nthen muttered, “I haven’t given them the chance. I’ve \\nbeen on the move for a year. Never stay in one place \\nmore than a week. Move from Muggle house to \\n\\nPage | 75 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMuggle house — the owners of this place are on \\nholiday in the Canary Islands — it’s been very \\npleasant, I’ll be sorry to leave. It’s quite easy once you \\nknow how, one simple Freezing Charm on these \\nabsurd burglar alarms they use instead of \\nSneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors don’t \\nspot you bringing in the piano.” \\n\\n“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “But it sounds a rather \\ntiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in \\nsearch of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to \\nHogwarts — ” \\n\\n“If you’re going to tell me my life would be more \\npeaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your \\nbreath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some \\nfunny rumors have reached me since Dolores \\nUmbridge left! If that’s how you treat teachers these \\ndays — ” \\n\\n“Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. “I think you, Horace, would have \\nknown better than to stride into the forest and call a \\nhorde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-breeds.’ ” \\n\\n“That’s what she did, did she?” said Slughorn. “Idiotic \\nwoman. Never liked her.” \\n\\nHarry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn \\nlooked round at him. \\n\\n“Sorry,” Harry said hastily. “It’s just — I didn’t like \\nher either.” \\n\\nDumbledore stood up rather suddenly. \\n\\n“Are you leaving?” asked Slughorn at once, looking \\nhopeful. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 76 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, I was wondering whether I might use your \\nbathroom,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Oh,” said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. “Second on \\nthe left down the hall.” \\n\\nDumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had \\nclosed behind him, there was silence. After a few \\nmoments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed \\nuncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive \\nlook at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his \\nback on it, warming his wide behind. \\n\\n“Don’t think I don’t know why he’s brought you,” he \\nsaid abruptly. \\n\\nHarry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn ’s watery \\neyes slid over Harry’s scar, this time taking in the rest \\nof his face. \\n\\n“You look very like your father.” \\n\\n“Yeah, I’ve been told,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Except for your eyes. You’ve got — ” \\n\\n“My mother’s eyes, yeah.” Harry had heard it so often \\nhe found it a bit wearing. \\n\\n“Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn’t have favorites as a \\nteacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your \\nmother,” Slughorn added, in answer to Harry’s \\nquestioning look. “Lily Evans. One of the brightest I \\never taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I \\nused to tell her she ought to have been in my House. \\nVery cheeky answers I used to get back too.” \\n\\n“Which was your House?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 77 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” \\nhe went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry’s \\nface and wagging a stubby finger at him, “don’t go \\nholding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, \\n\\nI suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not \\nalways, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must \\nhave done — been in the papers for the last couple of \\nyears — died a few weeks ago — ” \\n\\nIt was as though an invisible hand had twisted \\nHarry’s intestines and held them tight. \\n\\n“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at \\nschool. The whole Black family had been in my \\nHouse, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame — \\nhe was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, \\nwhen he came along, but I’d have liked the set.” \\n\\nHe sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had \\nbeen outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, \\nhe gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot \\nto ensure an even heat on his backside. \\n\\n“Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn’t \\nbelieve it when I found out. Thought she must have \\nbeen pure-blood, she was so good.” \\n\\n“One of my best friends is Muggle-born,” said Harry, \\n“and she’s the best in our year.” \\n\\n“Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it?” said \\nSlughorn. \\n\\n“Not really,” said Harry coldly. \\n\\nSlughorn looked down at him in surprise. “You \\nmustn’t think I’m prejudiced!” he said. “No, no, no! \\nHaven’t I just said your mother was one of my all-time \\nfavorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in \\n\\nPage | 78 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe year after her too — now Head of the Goblin \\nLiaison Office, of course — another Muggle-born, a \\nvery gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside \\ninformation on the goings-on at Gringotts!” \\n\\nHe bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self- \\nsatisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering \\nphotograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with \\ntiny moving occupants. \\n\\n“All ex-students, all signed. You’ll notice Barnabas \\nCuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he’s always \\ninterested to hear my take on the day’s news. And \\nAmbrosius Flume, of Honeydukes — a hamper every \\nbirthday, and all because I was able to give him an \\nintroduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his \\nfirst job! And at the back — you’ll see her if you just \\ncrane your neck — that’s Gwenog Jones, who of \\ncourse captains the Holyhead Harpies. ... People are \\nalways astonished to hear I’m on first-name terms \\nwith the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want \\nthem!” \\n\\nThis thought seemed to cheer him up enormously. \\n\\n“And all these people know where to find you, to send \\nyou stuff?” asked Harry, who could not help \\nwondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked \\ndown Slughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch \\ntickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions \\ncould find him. \\n\\nThe smile slid from Slughorn ’s face as quickly as the \\nblood from his walls. \\n\\n“Of course not,” he said, looking down at Harry. “I \\nhave been out of touch with everybody for a year.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 79 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had the impression that the words shocked \\nSlughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a \\nmoment. Then he shrugged. \\n\\n“Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in \\nsuch times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but \\ntaking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be \\ntantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the \\nOrder of the Phoenix! And while I’m sure they’re very \\nadmirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’t \\npersonally fancy the mortality rate — ” \\n\\n“You don’t have to join the Order to teach at \\nHogwarts,” said Harry, who could not quite keep a \\nnote of derision out of his voice: It was hard to \\nsympathize with Slughorn ’s cosseted existence when \\nhe remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living \\non rats. “Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of \\nthem has ever been killed — well, unless you count \\nQuirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he \\nwas working with Voldemort.” \\n\\nHarry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those \\nwizards who could not bear to hear Voldemort’s name \\nspoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn \\ngave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry \\nignored. \\n\\n“I reckon the staff are safer than most people while \\nDumbledore ’s headmaster; he’s supposed to be the \\nonly one Voldemort ever feared, isn’t he?” Harry went \\non. \\n\\nSlughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He \\nseemed to be thinking over Harry’s words. \\n\\n“Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named \\nhas never sought a fight with Dumbledore,” he \\nmuttered grudgingly. “And I suppose one could argue \\n\\nPage | 80 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat as I have not joined the Death Eaters, He-Who- \\nMust-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend ... \\nin which case, I might well be safer a little closer to \\nAlbus. ... I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones’s death \\ndid not shake me. ... If she, with all her Ministry \\ncontacts and protection ...” \\n\\nDumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn \\njumped as though he had forgotten he was in the \\nhouse. \\n\\n“Oh, there you are, Albus,” he said. “You’ve been a \\nvery long time. Upset stomach?” \\n\\n“No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. “I do love knitting patterns. Well, \\nHarry, we have trespassed upon Horace’s hospitality \\nquite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.” \\n\\nNot at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. \\nSlughorn seemed taken aback. \\n\\n“You’re leaving?” \\n\\n“Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see \\none.” \\n\\n“Lost... ?” \\n\\nSlughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat \\nthumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore \\nfasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket. \\n\\n“Well, I’m sorry you don’t want the job, Horace,” said \\nDumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell \\nsalute. “Hogwarts would have been glad to see you \\nback again. Our greatly increased security \\nnotwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, \\nshould you wish to.” \\n\\nPage | 81 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes ... well ... very gracious ... as I say ...” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Good-bye, then.” \\n\\n“Bye,” said Harry. \\n\\nThey were at the front door when there was a shout \\nfrom behind them. \\n\\n“All right, all right, 111 do it!” \\n\\nDumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing \\nbreathless in the doorway to the sitting room. \\n\\n“You will come out of retirement?” \\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently. “I must be mad, \\nbut yes.” \\n\\n“Wonderful,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Then, \\nHorace, we shall see you on the first of September.” \\n\\n“Yes, I daresay you will,” grunted Slughorn. \\n\\nAs they set off down the garden path, Slughorn ’s voice \\nfloated after them, “111 want a pay rise, Dumbledore!” \\n\\nDumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut \\nbehind them, and they set off back down the hill \\nthrough the dark and the swirling mist. \\n\\n“Well done, Harry,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“I didn’t do anything,” said Harry in surprise. \\n\\n“Oh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how \\nmuch he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did \\nyou like him?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 82 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Er ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry wasn’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. \\nHe supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he \\nhad also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the \\ncontrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born \\nshould make a good witch. \\n\\n“Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the \\nresponsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort. He \\nalso likes the company of the famous, the successful, \\nand the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he \\ninfluences these people. He has never wanted to \\noccupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat — \\nmore room to spread out, you see. He used to \\nhandpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their \\nambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm \\nor their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for \\nchoosing those who would go on to become \\noutstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a \\nkind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, \\nmaking introductions, forging useful contacts \\nbetween members, and always reaping some kind of \\nbenefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite \\ncrystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the \\nnext junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office.” \\n\\nHarry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great \\nswollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a \\nthread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies \\na little closer. \\n\\n“I tell you all this,” Dumbledore continued, “not to \\nturn you against Horace — or, as we must now call \\nhim, Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your \\nguard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. \\nYou would be the jewel of his collection; ‘the Boy Who \\nLived’ ... or, as they call you these days, ‘the Chosen \\nOne.’” \\n\\nPage | 83 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the \\nsurrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded \\nof words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that \\nhad a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither \\ncan live while the other survives . . . \\n\\nDumbledore had stopped walking, level with the \\nchurch they had passed earlier. \\n\\n“This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.” \\n\\nBraced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, \\nbut still found it unpleasant. When the pressure \\ndisappeared and he found himself able to breathe \\nagain, he was standing in a country lane beside \\nDumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked \\nsilhouette of his second favorite building in the world: \\nthe Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had \\njust swept through him, his spirits could not help but \\nlift at the sight of it. Ron was in there ... and so was \\nMrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he \\nknew. ... \\n\\n“If you don’t mind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, as they \\npassed through the gate, “I’d like a few words with \\nyou before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?” \\n\\nDumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone \\nouthouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. \\nA little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through \\nthe creaking door into a space a little smaller than the \\naverage cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of \\nhis wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled \\ndown at Harry. \\n\\n“I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, \\nbut I am pleased and a little proud at how well you \\nseem to be coping after everything that happened at \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 84 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius \\nwould have been proud of you.” \\n\\nHarry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted \\nhim. He did not think he could stand to discuss \\nSirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle \\nVernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and even worse to \\nhear Sirius’s name thrown out casually by Slughorn. \\n\\n“It was cruel,” said Dumbledore softly, “that you and \\nSirius had such a short time together. A brutal \\nending to what should have been a long and happy \\nrelationship.” \\n\\nHarry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider \\nnow climbing Dumbledore’s hat. He could tell that \\nDumbledore understood, that he might even suspect \\nthat until his letter arrived, Harry had spent nearly all \\nhis time at the Dursleys’ lying on his bed, refusing \\nmeals, and staring at the misted window, full of the \\nchill emptiness that he had come to associate with \\ndementors. \\n\\n“It’s just hard,” Harry said finally, in a low voice, “to \\nrealize he won’t write to me again.” \\n\\nHis eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt \\nstupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had \\nsomeone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened \\nto him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best \\nthings about discovering his godfather . . . and now the \\npost owls would never bring him that comfort again. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Sirius represented much to you that you had never \\nknown before,” said Dumbledore gently. “Naturally, \\nthe loss is devastating. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 85 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But while I was at the Dursleys’ ...” interrupted \\nHarry, his voice growing stronger, “I realized I can’t \\nshut myself away or — or crack up. Sirius wouldn’t \\nhave wanted that, would he? And anyway, life’s too \\nshort. ... Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline \\nVance. ... It could be me next, couldn’t it? But if it is,” \\nhe said fiercely, now looking straight into \\nDumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, \\n\\n“I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me \\nas I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.” \\n\\n“Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and \\nSirius’s true godson!” said Dumbledore, with an \\napproving pat on Harry’s back. “I take my hat off to \\nyou — or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you \\nin spiders. \\n\\n“And now, Harry, on a closely related subject ... I \\ngather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet \\nover the last two weeks?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster. \\n\\n“Then you will have seen that there have been not so \\nmuch leaks as floods concerning your adventure in \\nthe Hall of Prophecy?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry again. “And now everyone knows \\nthat I’m the one — ” \\n\\n“No, they do not,” interrupted Dumbledore. “There are \\nonly two people in the whole world who know the full \\ncontents of the prophecy made about you and Lord \\nVoldemort, and they are both standing in this smelly, \\nspidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many \\nhave guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his \\nDeath Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the \\nprophecy concerned you. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 86 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not \\ntold anybody that you know what the prophecy said?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry. \\n\\n“A wise decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore. \\n“Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your \\nfriends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione \\nGranger. Yes,” he continued, when Harry looked \\nstartled, “I think they ought to know. You do them a \\ndisservice by not confiding something this important \\nto them.” \\n\\n“I didn’t want — ” \\n\\n“ — to worry or frighten them?” said Dumbledore, \\nsurveying Harry over the top of his half-moon \\nspectacles. “Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself \\nare worried and frightened? You need your friends, \\nHarry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have \\nwanted you to shut yourself away.” \\n\\nHarry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to \\nrequire an answer. He continued, “On a different, \\nthough related, subject, it is my wish that you take \\nprivate lessons with me this year.” \\n\\n“Private — with you?” said Harry, surprised out of his \\npreoccupied silence. \\n\\n“Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in \\nyour education.” \\n\\n“What will you be teaching me, sir?” \\n\\n“Oh, a little of this, a little of that,” said Dumbledore \\nairily. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 87 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not \\nelaborate, so he asked something else that had been \\nbothering him slightly. \\n\\n“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do \\nOcclumency lessons with Snape, will I?” \\n\\n“Professor Snape, Harry — and no, you will not.” \\n\\n“Good,” said Harry in relief, “because they were a — ” \\n\\nHe stopped, careful not to say what he really thought. \\n\\n“I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,” \\nsaid Dumbledore, nodding. \\n\\nHarry laughed. \\n\\n“Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor \\nSnape from now on,” he said, “because he won’t let \\nme carry on Potions unless I get ‘Outstanding’ in my \\nO.W.L., which I know I haven’t.” \\n\\n“Don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said \\nDumbledore gravely. “Which, now I think of it, ought \\nto be some time later today. Now, two more things, \\nHarry, before we part. \\n\\n“Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with \\nyou at all times from this moment onward. Even \\nwithin Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand \\nme?” \\n\\nHarry nodded. \\n\\n“And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been \\ngiven the highest security the Ministry of Magic can \\nprovide. These measures have caused a certain \\namount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly — all \\n\\nPage | 88 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir post, for instance, is being searched at the \\nMinistry before being sent on. They do not mind in \\nthe slightest, for their only concern is your safety. \\nHowever, it would be poor repayment if you risked \\nyour neck while staying with them.” \\n\\n“I understand,” said Harry quickly. \\n\\n“Very well, then,” said Dumbledore, pushing open the \\nbroom shed door and stepping out into the yard. “I \\nsee a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly \\nany longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 89 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAN EXCESS OF PHLEGM \\n\\nHarry and Dumbledore approached the back door of \\nthe Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar \\nlitter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; \\nHarry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens \\ncoming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked \\nthree times and Harry saw sudden movement behind \\nthe kitchen window. \\n\\n“Who’s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as \\nMrs. Weasley’s. “Declare yourself!” \\n\\n“It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.” \\n\\nThe door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, \\nshort, plump, and wearing an old green dressing \\ngown. \\n\\n“Harry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, \\nyou said not to expect you before morning!” \\n\\n“We were lucky,” said Dumbledore, ushering Harry \\nover the threshold. “Slughorn proved much more \\n\\nPage | 90 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\npersuadable than I had expected. Harry’s doing, of \\ncourse. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!” \\n\\nHarry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was \\nnot alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young \\nwitch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy \\nbrown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large \\nmug between her hands. \\n\\n“Hello, Professor,” she said. “Wotcher, Harry.” \\n\\n“Hi, Tonks.” \\n\\nHarry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there \\nwas something forced in her smile. Certainly her \\nappearance was less colorful than usual without her \\ncustomary shade of bubble-gum-pink hair. \\n\\n“I’d better be off,” she said quickly, standing up and \\npulling her cloak around her shoulders. “Thanks for \\nthe tea and sympathy, Molly.” \\n\\n“Please don’t leave on my account,” said Dumbledore \\ncourteously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to \\ndiscuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.” \\n\\n“No, no, I need to get going,” said Tonks, not meeting \\nDumbledore’s eyes. “ ’Night — ” \\n\\n“Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, \\n\\nRemus and Mad-Eye are coming — ?” \\n\\n“No, really, Molly ... thanks anyway ... Good night, \\neveryone.” \\n\\nTonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the \\nyard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on \\nthe spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed \\nthat Mrs. Weasley looked troubled. \\n\\nPage | 91 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,” said \\nDumbledore. “Take care of yourself. Molly, your \\nservant.” \\n\\nHe made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, \\nvanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley \\nclosed the door on the empty yard and then steered \\nHarry by the shoulders into the full glow of the \\nlantern on the table to examine his appearance. \\n\\n“You’re like Ron,” she sighed, looking him up and \\ndown. “Both of you look as though you’ve had \\nStretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron’s grown \\nfour inches since I last bought him school robes. Are \\nyou hungry, Harry?” \\n\\n“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, suddenly realizing just how \\nhungry he was. \\n\\n“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.” \\n\\nAs Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed \\nface jumped onto his knees and settled there, \\npurring. \\n\\n“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled \\nCrookshanks behind the ears. \\n\\n“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,” said \\nMrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. \\nIt bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began \\nto bubble at once. “Everyone’s in bed, of course, we \\ndidn’t expect you for hours. Here you are — ” \\n\\nShe tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew \\ntoward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a \\nbowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the \\nstream of thick, steaming onion soup. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 92 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Bread, dear?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Thanks, Mrs. Weasley.” \\n\\nShe waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of \\nbread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as \\nthe loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back \\nonto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down opposite him. \\n\\n“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?” \\n\\nHarry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he \\ncould not speak. \\n\\n“He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. Weasley. “He \\nwas at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same \\ntime as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?” \\n\\nHis mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and \\ngave a noncommittal jerk of the head. \\n\\n“I know what you mean,” said Mrs. Weasley, nodding \\nwisely. “Of course he can be charming when he wants \\nto be, but Arthur’s never liked him much. The \\nMinistry’s littered with Slughorn’s old favorites, he \\nwas always good at giving leg ups, but he never had \\nmuch time for Arthur — didn’t seem to think he was \\nenough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even \\nSlughorn makes mistakes. I don’t know whether \\nRon’s told you in any of his letters — it’s only just \\nhappened — but Arthur’s been promoted!” \\n\\nIt could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had \\nbeen bursting to say this. \\n\\nHarry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and \\nthought he could feel his throat blistering. “That’s \\ngreat!” he gasped. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 93 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are sweet,” beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly \\ntaking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. \\n\\n“Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices \\nin response to the present situation, and Arthur’s \\nheading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation \\nof Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. \\nIt’s a big job, he’s got ten people reporting to him \\nnow!” \\n\\n“What exactly — ?” \\n\\n“Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, \\nodd things have been cropping up for sale \\neverywhere, things that are supposed to guard \\nagainst You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You \\ncan imagine the kind of thing — so-called protective \\npotions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber \\npus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that \\nactually make your ears fall off. ... Well, in the main \\nthe perpetrators are just people like Mundungus \\nFletcher, who’ve never done an honest day’s work in \\ntheir lives and are taking advantage of how frightened \\neverybody is, but every now and then something \\nreally nasty turns up. The other day Arthur \\nconfiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were \\nalmost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you \\nsee, it’s a very important job, and I tell him it’s just \\nsilly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters \\nand all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.” Mrs. Weasley \\nended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been \\nHarry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark \\nplugs. \\n\\n“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?” Harry asked. \\n\\n“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. ... \\nHe said he’d be back around midnight. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 94 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe turned to look at a large clock that was perched \\nawkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing \\nbasket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at \\nonce: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the \\nname of a family member, and usually hung on the \\nWeasleys’ sitting room wall, though its current \\nposition suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to \\ncarrying it around the house with her. Every single \\none of its nine hands was now pointing at “mortal \\nperil.” \\n\\n“It’s been like that for a while now,” said Mrs. \\n\\nWeasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, “ever \\nsince You-Know-Who came back into the open. I \\nsuppose everybody’s in mortal danger now. ... I don’t \\nthink it can be just our family ... but I don’t know \\nanyone else who’s got a clock like this, so I can’t \\ncheck. Oh!” \\n\\nWith a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock’s \\nface. Mr. Weasley’s hand had switched to “traveling.” \\n\\n“He’s coming!” \\n\\nAnd sure enough, a moment later there was a knock \\non the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and \\nhurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her \\nface pressed against the wood she called softly, \\n“Arthur, is that you?” \\n\\n“Yes,” came Mr. Weasley’s weary voice. “But I would \\nsay that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the \\nquestion!” \\n\\n“Oh, honestly ...” \\n\\n“Molly!” \\n\\n“All right, all right . . . What is your dearest ambition?” \\n\\nPage | 95 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“To find out how airplanes stay up.” \\n\\nMrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but \\napparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the \\nother side, because the door remained firmly shut. \\n\\n“Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first!” \\n\\n“Arthur, really, this is just silly. ...” \\n\\n“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone \\ntogether?” \\n\\nEven by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell \\nthat Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself \\nfelt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and \\nhastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as \\nhe could against the bowl. \\n\\n“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley \\ninto the crack at the edge of the door. \\n\\n“Correct,” said Mr. Weasley. “Now you can let me in.” \\n\\nMrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, \\na thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn- \\nrimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling \\ncloak. \\n\\n“I still don’t see why we have to go through that every \\ntime you come home,” said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in \\nthe face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. \\n\\n“I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer \\nout of you before impersonating you!” \\n\\n“I know, dear, but it’s Ministry procedure, and I have \\nto set an example. Something smells good — onion \\nsoup?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 96 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the \\ntable. \\n\\n“Harry! We didn’t expect you until morning!” \\n\\nThey shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the \\nchair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup \\nin front of him too. \\n\\n“Thanks, Molly. It’s been a tough night. Some idiot’s \\nstarted selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them \\naround your neck and you’ll be able to change your \\nappearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all \\nfor ten Galleons!” \\n\\n“And what really happens when you put them on?” \\n\\n“Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, \\nbut a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike \\nwarts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo’s didn’t \\nhave enough to do already!” \\n\\n“It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George \\nwould find funny,” said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. “Are \\nyou sure — ?” \\n\\n“Of course I am!” said Mr. Weasley. “The boys \\nwouldn’t do anything like that now, not when people \\nare desperate for protection!” \\n\\n“So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?” \\n\\n“No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in \\nElephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law \\nEnforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we \\ngot there. ...” \\n\\nHarry stifled a yawn behind his hand. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 97 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. “I’ve \\ngot Fred and George’s room all ready for you, you’ll \\nhave it to yourself.” \\n\\n“Why, where are they?” \\n\\n“Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat \\nover their joke shop as they’re so busy,” said Mrs. \\nWeasley. “I must say, I didn’t approve at first, but \\nthey do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! \\n\\nCome on, dear, your trunk’s already up there.” \\n\\n“ ’Night, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, pushing back his \\nchair. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and \\nslunk out of the room. \\n\\n“G’night, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley. \\n\\nHarry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the \\nwashing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands \\nwere once again at “mortal peril.” \\n\\nFred and George’s bedroom was on the second floor. \\nMrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the \\nbedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room \\nin a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of \\nflowers had been placed on a desk in front of the \\nsmall window, their perfume could not disguise the \\nlingering smell of what Harry thought was \\ngunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was \\ndevoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed \\ncardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry’s school \\ntrunk. The room looked as though it was being used \\nas a temporary warehouse. \\n\\nHedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top \\nof a large wardrobe, then took off through the \\nwindow; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him \\nbefore going hunting. Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good \\n\\nPage | 98 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnight, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. \\nThere was something hard inside the pillowcase. He \\ngroped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and- \\norange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking \\nPastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was \\ninstantly asleep. \\n\\nSeconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was \\nawakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the \\ndoor burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the \\nrasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling \\nsunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. \\nShielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly \\nfor his glasses with the other. \\n\\n“Wuzzgoinon?” \\n\\n“We didn’t know you were here already!” said a loud \\nand excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the \\ntop of the head. \\n\\n“Ron, don’t hit him!” said a girl’s voice reproachfully. \\n\\nHarry’s hand found his glasses and he shoved them \\non, though the light was so bright he could hardly see \\nanyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of \\nhim for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came \\ninto focus, grinning down at him. \\n\\n“All right?” \\n\\n“Never been better,” said Harry, rubbing the top of his \\nhead and slumping back onto his pillows. “You?” \\n\\n“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and \\nsitting on it. “When did you get here? Mum’s only just \\ntold us!” \\n\\n“About one o’clock this morning.” \\n\\nPage | 99 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?” \\n\\n“Same as usual,” said Harry, as Hermione perched \\nherself on the edge of his bed, “they didn’t talk to me \\nmuch, but I like it better that way. How’re you, \\nHermione?” \\n\\n“Oh, I’m fine,” said Hermione, who was scrutinizing \\nHarry as though he was sickening for something. He \\nthought he knew what was behind this, and as he \\nhad no wish to discuss Sirius’s death or any other \\nmiserable subject at the moment, he said, “What’s the \\ntime? Have I missed breakfast?” \\n\\n“Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a \\ntray; she reckons you look underfed,” said Ron, \\nrolling his eyes. “So, what’s been going on?” \\n\\n“Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and \\nuncle’s, haven’t I?” \\n\\n“Come off it!” said Ron. “You’ve been off with \\nDumbledore!” \\n\\n“It wasn’t that exciting. He just wanted me to help \\nhim persuade this old teacher to come out of \\nretirement. His name’s Horace Slughorn.” \\n\\n“Oh,” said Ron, looking disappointed. “We thought — ” \\n\\nHermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron \\nchanged tack at top speed. \\n\\n“ — we thought it’d be something like that.” \\n\\n“You did?” said Harry, amused. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 100 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah ... yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we \\nneed a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, \\ndon’t we? So, er, what’s he like?” \\n\\n“He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head \\nof Slytherin,” said Harry. “Something wrong, \\nHermione?” \\n\\nShe was watching him as though expecting strange \\nsymptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. \\n\\nShe rearranged her features hastily in an \\nunconvincing smile. \\n\\n“No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like \\nhe’ll be a good teacher?” \\n\\n“Dunno,” said Harry. “He can’t be worse than \\nUmbridge, can he?” \\n\\n“I know someone who’s worse than Umbridge,” said a \\nvoice from the doorway. Ron’s younger sister slouched \\ninto the room, looking irritable. “Hi, Harry.” \\n\\n“What’s up with you?” Ron asked. \\n\\n“It’s her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on \\nHarry’s bed. “She’s driving me mad.” \\n\\n“What’s she done now?” asked Hermione \\nsympathetically. \\n\\n“It’s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was \\nabout three!” \\n\\n“I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She’s so \\nfull of herself.” \\n\\nHarry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about \\nMrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for \\n\\nPage | 101 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsaying angrily, “Can’t you two lay off her for five \\nseconds?” \\n\\n“Oh, that’s right, defend her,” snapped Ginny. “We all \\nknow you can’t get enough of her.” \\n\\nThis seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’s \\nmother. Starting to feel that he was missing \\nsomething, Harry said, “Who are you — ?” \\n\\nBut his question was answered before he could finish \\nit. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry \\ninstinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so \\nhard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto \\nthe floor. \\n\\nA young woman was standing in the doorway, a \\nwoman of such breathtaking beauty that the room \\nseemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall \\nand willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to \\nemanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision \\nof perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden \\nbreakfast tray. \\n\\n“ ’Arry,” she said in a throaty voice. “Eet ’as been too \\nlong!” \\n\\nAs she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. \\nWeasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, \\nlooking rather cross. \\n\\n“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just \\nabout to do it myself!” \\n\\n“Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour, setting the \\ntray across Harry’s knees and then swooping to kiss \\nhim on each cheek: He felt the places where her \\nmouth had touched him burn. “I ’ave been longing to \\nsee ’im. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She \\nPage | 102 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnever stops talking about ’Ariy Potter. She will be \\ndelighted to see you again.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh ... is she here too?” Harry croaked. \\n\\n“No, no, silly boy,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I \\nmean next summer, when we — but do you not \\nknow?” \\n\\nHer great blue eyes widened and she looked \\nreproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, “We hadn’t \\ngot around to telling him yet.” \\n\\nFleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet \\nof hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the \\nface. \\n\\n“Bill and I are going to be married!” \\n\\n“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing \\nhow Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were all \\ndeterminedly avoiding one another’s gaze. “Wow. Er \\n— congratulations!” \\n\\nShe swooped down upon him and kissed him again. \\n\\n“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, \\nand I only work part-time at Gringotts for my \\nEenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get \\nto know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to ’ear \\nyou would be coming — zere isn’t much to do ’ere, \\nunless you like cooking and chickens! Well — enjoy \\nyour breakfast, ’Arry!” \\n\\nWith these words she turned gracefully and seemed to \\nfloat out of the room, closing the door quietly behind \\nher. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!” \\n\\nPage | 103 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly. \\n\\n“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross \\nwhisper. “I just think they’ve hurried into this \\nengagement, that’s all!” \\n\\n“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who \\nlooked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed \\ndoor. \\n\\n“Well, that’s not very long! I know why it’s happened, \\nof course. It’s all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who \\ncoming back, people think they might be dead \\ntomorrow, so they’re rushing all sorts of decisions \\nthey’d normally take time over. It was the same last \\ntime he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and \\ncenter — ” \\n\\n“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly. \\n\\n“Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, \\nwhat was the point in waiting?” said Mrs. Weasley. \\n“Whereas Bill and Fleur . . . well . . . what have they \\nreally got in common? He’s a hardworking, down-to- \\nearth sort of person, whereas she’s — ” \\n\\n“A cow,” said Ginny, nodding. “But Bill’s not that \\ndown-to-earth. He’s a Curse-Breaker, isn’t he, he \\nlikes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour. ... I expect \\nthat’s why he’s gone for Phlegm.” \\n\\n“Stop calling her that, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley \\nsharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed. “Well, I’d \\nbetter get on. ... Eat your eggs while they’re warm, \\nHarry.” \\n\\nLooking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed \\nslightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 104 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nexperimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of \\nwater. \\n\\n“Don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same \\nhouse?” Harry asked. \\n\\n“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you \\nunexpectedly, like then ...” \\n\\n“It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away \\nfrom Ron as far as she could go and turning to face \\nhim with her arms folded once she had reached the \\nwall. \\n\\n“You don’t really want her around forever?” Ginny \\nasked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, \\nshe said, “Well, Mum’s going to put a stop to it if she \\ncan, I bet you anything.” \\n\\n“How’s she going to manage that?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I \\nthink she’s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I \\nhope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family.” \\n\\n“Yeah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically. “Listen, \\nno bloke in his right mind’s going to fancy Tonks \\nwhen Fleur’s around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking \\nwhen she isn’t doing stupid things to her hair and her \\nnose, but — ” \\n\\n“She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm,” said Ginny \\n\\n“And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!” said \\nHermione from the corner. \\n\\n“Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the \\nTriwizard Tournament,” said Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 105 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry,’ do \\nyou?” asked Ginny scornfully. \\n\\n“No,” said Harry, wishing he hadn’t spoken, “I was \\njust saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur — ” \\n\\n“I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said \\nGinny. “At least she’s a laugh.” \\n\\n“She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately,” said Ron. \\n“Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like \\nMoaning Myrtle.” \\n\\n“That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’t \\ngot over what happened . . . you know ... I mean, he \\nwas her cousin!” \\n\\nHarry’s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He \\npicked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs \\ninto his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join \\nin this part of the conversation. \\n\\n“Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron. \\n“Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that \\ntheir families never met — ” \\n\\n“That’s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it \\nwas her fault he died!” \\n\\n“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry, in \\nspite of himself. \\n\\n“Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t \\nshe? I think she feels that if only she had finished her \\noff, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.” \\n\\n“That’s stupid,” said Ron. \\n\\nPage | 106 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s survivor’s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’s \\ntried to talk her round, but she’s still really down. \\nShe’s actually having trouble with her \\nMetamorphosing! ” \\n\\n“With her — ?” \\n\\n“She can’t change her appearance like she used to,” \\nexplained Hermione. “I think her powers must have \\nbeen affected by shock, or something.” \\n\\n“I didn’t know that could happen,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re \\nreally depressed ...” \\n\\nThe door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her \\nhead in. “Ginny,” she whispered, “come downstairs \\nand help me with the lunch.” \\n\\n“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny, outraged. \\n\\n“Now!” said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew. \\n\\n“She only wants me there so she doesn’t have to be \\nalone with Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly. She swung \\nher long red hair around in a very good imitation of \\nFleur and pranced across the room with her arms \\nheld aloft like a ballerina. \\n\\n“You lot had better come down quickly too,” she said \\nas she left. \\n\\nHarry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat \\nmore breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and \\nGeorge’s boxes, though every now and then she cast \\nsideways looks at Harry. Ron, who was now helping \\nhimself to Harry’s toast, was still gazing dreamily at \\nthe door. \\n\\nPage | 107 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s this?” Hermione asked eventually, holding up \\nwhat looked like a small telescope. \\n\\n“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George’ve left it \\nhere, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so \\nbe careful.” \\n\\n“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry. \\n“Said Fred and George have got a real flair for \\nbusiness.” \\n\\n“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking \\nin the Galleons! I can’t wait to see the place, we \\nhaven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says \\nDad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been \\nreally busy at work, but it sounds excellent.” \\n\\n“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third- \\neldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of \\nthe family. “Is he talking to your mum and dad \\nagain?” \\n\\n“Nope,” said Ron. \\n\\n“But he knows your dad was right all along now \\nabout Voldemort being back — ” \\n\\n“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive \\nothers for being wrong than being right,” said \\nHermione. “I heard him telling your mum, Ron.” \\n\\n“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore \\nwould say,” said Ron. \\n\\n“He’s going to be giving me private lessons this year,” \\nsaid Harry conversationally. \\n\\nRon choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 108 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You kept that quiet!” said Ron. \\n\\n“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly. “He \\ntold me last night in your broom shed.” \\n\\n“Blimey ... private lessons with Dumbledore!” said \\nRon, looking impressed. “I wonder why he’s ... ?” \\n\\nHis voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione \\nexchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, \\nhis heart beating rather fast considering that all he \\nwas doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to \\ndo it. ... Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, \\nwhich was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his \\nlap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to \\nbe giving me lessons, but I think it must be because \\nof the prophecy.” \\n\\nNeither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the \\nimpression that both had frozen. He continued, still \\nspeaking to his fork, “You know, the one they were \\ntrying to steal at the Ministry.” \\n\\n“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione \\nquickly. “It got smashed.” \\n\\n“Although the Prophet says — ” began Ron, but \\nHermione said, “Shh!” \\n\\n“The Prophet’s got it right,” said Harry, looking up at \\nthem both with a great effort: Hermione seemed \\nfrightened and Ron amazed. “That glass ball that \\nsmashed wasn’t the only record of the prophecy. I \\nheard the whole thing in Dumbledore ’s office, he was \\nthe one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell \\nme. From what it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it \\nlooks like I’m the one who’s got to finish off \\nVoldemort. ... At least, it said neither of us could live \\nwhile the other survives.” \\n\\nPage | 109 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe three of them gazed at one another in silence for \\na moment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione \\nvanished behind a puff of black smoke. \\n\\n“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast \\ntray slid to the floor with a crash. \\n\\nHermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, \\nclutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly \\npurple black eye. \\n\\n“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped. \\n\\nAnd sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long \\nspring protruding from the end of the telescope. \\n\\n“Don’t worry,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to \\nlaugh, “Mumll fix that, she’s good at healing minor \\ninjuries — ” \\n\\n“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione \\nhastily. “Harry, oh, Harry ...” \\n\\nShe sat down on the edge of his bed again. \\n\\n“We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry ... \\nObviously, we didn’t want to say anything to you, but \\nfrom what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, \\nhow it was about you and Voldemort, well, we \\nthought it might be something like this. ... Oh, Harry \\n...” She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you \\nscared?” \\n\\n“Not as much as I was,” said Harry. “When I first \\nheard it, I was . . . but now, it seems as though I \\nalways knew I’d have to face him in the end. ...” \\n\\n“When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in \\nperson, we thought he might be telling you something \\n\\nPage | 110 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nor showing you something to do with the prophecy,” \\nsaid Ron eagerly. “And we were kind of right, weren’t \\nwe? He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he thought \\nyou were a goner, wouldn’t waste his time — he must \\nthink you’ve got a chance!” \\n\\n“That’s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll \\nteach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, \\nprobably ... powerful countercurses ... anti-jinxes ...” \\n\\nHarry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading \\nthrough him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; \\na tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be \\ndissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were \\nmore shocked than they were letting on, but the mere \\nfact that they were still there on either side of him, \\nspeaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking \\nfrom him as though he were contaminated or \\ndangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell \\nthem. \\n\\n\"... and evasive enchantments generally,” concluded \\nHermione. “Well, at least you know one lesson you’ll \\nbe having this year, that’s one more than Ron and \\nme. I wonder when our O.W.L. results will come?” \\n\\n“Can’t be long now, it’s been a month,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Hang on,” said Harry, as another part of last night’s \\nconversation came back to him. “I think Dumbledore \\nsaid our O.W.L. results would be arriving today!” \\n\\n“Today?” shrieked Hermione. “Today? But why didn’t \\nyou — oh my God — you should have said — ” \\n\\nShe leapt to her feet. \\n\\n“I’m going to see whether any owls have come. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 111 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, \\nfully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it \\nwas to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in \\ngreat agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her \\nresemblance to half a panda. \\n\\n“It just won’t budge,” Mrs. Weasley was saying \\nanxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in \\nher hand and a copy of The Healer’s Helpmate open at \\n“Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always \\nworked before, I just can’t understand it.” \\n\\n“It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke, \\nmaking sure it can’t come off,” said Ginny \\n\\n“But it’s got to come off!” squeaked Hermione. “I can’t \\ngo around looking like this forever!” \\n\\n“You won’t, dear, we’ll find an antidote, don’t worry,” \\nsaid Mrs. Weasley soothingly. \\n\\n“Bill told me ’ow Fred and George are very amusing!” \\nsaid Fleur, smiling serenely. \\n\\n“Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped \\nHermione. \\n\\nShe jumped up and started walking round and round \\nthe kitchen, twisting her fingers together. \\n\\n“Mrs. Weasley, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have \\narrived this morning?” \\n\\n“Yes, dear, I’d have noticed,” said Mrs. Weasley \\npatiently. “But it’s barely nine, there’s still plenty of \\ntime. ...” \\n\\n“I know I messed up Ancient Runes,” muttered \\nHermione feverishly, “I definitely made at least one \\n\\nPage | 112 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nserious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the \\nDark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought \\nTransfiguration went all right at the time, but looking \\nback — ” \\n\\n“Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the only one \\nwho’s nervous!” barked Ron. “And when you’ve got \\nyour eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L.s ...” \\n\\n“Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said Hermione, flapping her \\nhands hysterically. “I know I’ve failed everything!” \\n\\n“What happens if we fail?” Harry asked the room at \\nlarge, but it was again Hermione who answered. \\n\\n“We discuss our options with our Head of House, I \\nasked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.” \\n\\nHarry’s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten \\nless breakfast. \\n\\n“At Beauxbatons,” said Fleur complacently, “we ’ad a \\ndifferent way of doing things. I think eet was better. \\nWe sat our examinations after six years of study, not \\nfive, and then — ” \\n\\nFleur’s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione \\nwas pointing through the kitchen window. Three \\nblack specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing \\nlarger all the time. \\n\\n“They’re definitely owls,” said Ron hoarsely, jumping \\nup to join Hermione at the window. \\n\\n“And there are three of them,” said Harry, hastening \\nto her other side. \\n\\n“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a terrified \\nwhisper. “Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ...” \\n\\nPage | 113 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the \\nelbows. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three \\nhandsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as \\nthey flew lower over the path leading up to the house, \\nwas carrying a large square envelope. \\n\\n“Oh no\\\\” squealed Hermione. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the \\nkitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared \\nthrough it and landed on the table in a neat line. All \\nthree of them lifted their right legs. \\n\\nHarry moved forward. The letter addressed to him \\nwas tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied \\nit with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to \\ndetach his own results; to his right, Hermione’s \\nhands were shaking so much she was making her \\nwhole owl tremble. \\n\\nNobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed \\nto detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and \\nunfolded the parchment inside. \\n\\nORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL RESULTS \\n\\n\\n\\nPass Grades Fail Grades \\n\\nOutstanding (O) Poor (P) \\n\\nExceeds Expectations (E) Dreadful (D) \\n\\nAcceptable (A) Troll (T) \\n\\nHarry James Potter has achieved: \\n\\nAstronomy A \\n\\nCare of Magical Creatures E \\n\\nPage | 114 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K.

It was \\nall right: He had always known that he would fail \\nDivination, and he had had no chance of passing \\nHistory of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway \\nthrough the examination, but he had passed \\neverything else! He ran his finger down the grades ... \\nhe had passed well in Transfiguration and Herbology, \\nhe had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And \\nbest of all, he had achieved “Outstanding” at Defense \\nAgainst the Dark Arts! \\n\\nHe looked around. Hermione had her back to him and \\nher head bent, but Ron was looking delighted. \\n\\n“Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who \\ncares about them?” he said happily to Harry. “Here — \\nswap — ” \\n\\nHarry glanced down Ron’s grades: There were no \\n“Outstandings” there. ... \\n\\n“Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” \\nsaid Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder. “We’ve \\ndone all right, haven’t we?” \\n\\n“Well done!” said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ron’s \\nhair. “Seven O.W.L.s, that’s more than Fred and \\nGeorge got together!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 115 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hermione?” said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still \\nhadn’t turned around. “How did you do?” \\n\\n“I — not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice. \\n\\n“Oh, come off it,” said Ron, striding over to her and \\nwhipping her results out of her hand. “Yep — nine \\n‘Outstandings’ and one ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at \\nDefense Against the Dark Arts.” He looked down at \\nher, half-amused, half-exasperated. “You’re actually \\ndisappointed, aren’t you?” \\n\\nHermione shook her head, but Harry laughed. \\n\\n“Well, we’re N.E.W.T. students now!” grinned Ron. \\n“Mum, are there any more sausages?” \\n\\nHarry looked back down at his results. They were as \\ngood as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny \\ntwinge of regret. ... This was the end of his ambition \\nto become an Auror. He had not secured the required \\nPotions grade. He had known all along that he \\nwouldn’t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as \\nhe looked again at that small black E. \\n\\nIt was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death \\nEater in disguise who had first told Harry he would \\nmake a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken \\nhold of him, and he couldn’t really think of anything \\nelse he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the \\nright destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy \\na few weeks ago. ... Neither can live while the other \\nsurvives. ... Wouldn’t he be living up to the prophecy, \\nand giving himself the best chance of survival, if he \\njoined those highly trained wizards whose job it was \\nto find and kill Voldemort? \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 116 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDRACO’S DETOUR \\n\\nHarry remained within the confines of the Burrow’s \\ngarden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his \\ndays playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys’ \\norchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; \\nHermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were \\nreasonably well matched) and his evenings eating \\ntriple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front \\nof him. \\n\\nIt would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it \\nnot been for the stories of disappearances, odd \\naccidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily \\nin the Prophet Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley \\nbrought home news before it even reached the paper. \\nTo Mrs. Weasley’s displeasure, Harry’s sixteenth \\nbirthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings \\nbrought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was \\nlooking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked \\nliberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and \\npatched than ever. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 117 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“There have been another couple of dementor \\nattacks,” he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him \\na large slice of birthday cake. “And they’ve found Igor \\nKarkaroff’s body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark \\nhad been set over it — well, frankly, I’m surprised he \\nstayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death \\nEaters; Sirius’s brother, Regulus, only managed a few \\ndays as far as I can remember.” \\n\\n“Yes, well,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, “perhaps we \\nshould talk about something diff — ” \\n\\n“Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?” \\nasked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. \\n“The man who ran — ” \\n\\n“ — the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry \\ninterrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in \\nthe pit of his stomach. “He used to give me free ice \\ncreams. What’s happened to him?” \\n\\n“Dragged off, by the look of his place.” \\n\\n“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly \\nglared at Bill. \\n\\n“Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow. He \\nwas a good man, Florean.” \\n\\n“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks \\nlike Ollivander’s gone too.” \\n\\n“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled. \\n\\n“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. \\nNo one knows whether he left voluntarily or was \\nkidnapped.” \\n\\n“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?” \\n\\nPage | 118 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But \\nOllivander was the best, and if the other side have got \\nhim it’s not so good for us.” \\n\\nThe day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their \\nletters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harry’s \\nincluded a surprise: He had been made Quidditch \\nCaptain. \\n\\n“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried \\nHermione happily. “You can use our special bathroom \\nnow and everything!” \\n\\n“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” \\nsaid Ron, examining the badge with glee. “Harry, this \\nis so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let me back on \\nthe team, I suppose, ha ha. ...” \\n\\n“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon \\nAlley much longer now you’ve got these,” sighed Mrs. \\nWeasley, looking down Ron’s booklist. “We’ll go on \\nSaturday as long as your father doesn’t have to go \\ninto work again. I’m not going there without him.” \\n\\n“Mum, d’you honestly think You-Know- Who’s going to \\nbe hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?” \\nsniggered Ron. \\n\\n“Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?” \\nsaid Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. “If you think \\nsecurity’s a laughing matter you can stay behind and \\nI’ll get your things myself — ” \\n\\n“No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George’s \\nshop!” said Ron hastily. \\n\\n“Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, \\nbefore I decide you’re too immature to come with us!” \\nsaid Mrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all \\n\\nPage | 119 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnine hands of which were still pointing at “mortal \\nperil,” and balancing it on top of a pile of just- \\nlaundered towels. “And that goes for returning to \\nHogwarts as well!” \\n\\nRon turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his \\nmother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering \\nclock into her arms and stormed out of the room. \\n\\n“Blimey ... you can’t even make a joke round here \\nanymore. ...” \\n\\nBut Ron was careful not to be flippant about \\nVoldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned \\nwithout any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, \\nthough she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who \\nwould be staying at home with Fleur (much to \\nHermione and Ginny’s pleasure), passed a full money \\nbag across the table to Harry. \\n\\n“Where’s mine?” demanded Ron at once, his eyes \\nwide. \\n\\n“That’s already Harry’s, idiot,” said Bill. “I got it out of \\nyour vault for you, Harry, because it’s taking about \\nfive hours for the public to get to their gold at the \\nmoment, the goblins have tightened security so \\nmuch. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity \\nProbe stuck up his ... Well, trust me, this way’s \\neasier.” \\n\\n“Thanks, Bill,” said Harry, pocketing his gold. \\n\\n“ ’E is always so thoughtful,” purred Fleur adoringly, \\nstroking Bill’s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her \\ncereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his \\ncornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 120 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was an overcast, murky day. One of the special \\nMinistry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden \\nonce before, was awaiting them in the front yard \\nwhen they emerged from the house, pulling on their \\ncloaks. \\n\\n“It’s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron \\nappreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car \\nmoved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur \\nwaving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, \\n\\nHermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy \\ncomfort in the wide backseat. \\n\\n“Don’t get used to it, it’s only because of Harry,” said \\nMr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley \\nwere in front with the Ministry driver; the front \\npassenger seat had obligingly stretched into what \\nresembled a two-seater sofa. “He’s been given top- \\ngrade security status. And we’ll be joining up with \\nadditional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.” \\n\\nHarry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his \\nshopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. \\nHe had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack \\nand felt that, if that was good enough for \\nDumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the \\nMinistry, though now he came to think of it, he was \\nnot sure the Ministry knew about his cloak. \\n\\n“Here you are, then,” said the driver, a surprisingly \\nshort while later, speaking for the first time as he \\nslowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside \\nthe Leaky Cauldron. “I’m to wait for you, any idea \\nhow long you 11 be?” \\n\\n“A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Ah, \\ngood, he’s here!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 121 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the \\nwindow; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting \\noutside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black- \\nbearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts \\ngamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming \\nat the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the \\nstartled stares of passing Muggles. \\n\\n“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone- \\ncrushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of \\nthe car. “Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh \\nshould see him, Harry, he’s so happy ter be back in \\nthe open air — ” \\n\\n“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harry, grinning as he \\nmassaged his ribs. “We didn’t know ‘security’ meant \\nyou!” \\n\\n“I know, jus’ like old times, innit? See, the Ministry \\nwanted ter send a bunch o’ Aurors, but Dumbledore \\nsaid I’d do,” said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his \\nchest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. “Let’s \\nget goin’ then — after yeh, Molly, Arthur — ” \\n\\nThe Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry’s \\nmemory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, \\nwizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He \\nlooked up hopefully as they entered, but before he \\ncould speak, Hagrid said importantly, “Jus’ passin’ \\nthrough today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts \\nbusiness, yeh know.” \\n\\nTom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; \\nHarry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked \\nthrough the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard \\nat the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised \\nhis pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the \\nwall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 122 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwinding cobbled street. They stepped through the \\nentrance and paused, looking around. \\n\\nDiagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering \\nwindow displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, \\nand cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the \\nlarge Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted \\nover them. Most of these somber purple posters \\ncarried blown-up versions of the security advice on \\nthe Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over \\nthe summer, but others bore moving black-and-white \\nphotographs of Death Eaters known to be on the \\nloose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front \\nof the nearest apothecary. A few windows were \\nboarded up, including those of Florean Fortescue’s Ice \\nCream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of \\nshabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. \\nThe nearest one, which had been erected outside \\nFlourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, \\nhad a cardboard sign pinned to its front: \\n\\nAMULETS \\n\\nEffective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi \\n\\nA seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of \\nsilver symbols on chains at passersby. \\n\\n“One for your little girl, madam?” he called at Mrs. \\nWeasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. “Protect her \\npretty neck?” \\n\\n“If I were on duty ...” said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily \\nat the amulet seller. \\n\\n“Yes, but don’t go arresting anyone now, dear, we’re \\nin a hurry,” said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a \\nlist. “I think we’d better do Madam Malkin’s first, \\nHermione wants new dress robes, and Ron’s showing \\n\\nPage | 123 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmuch too much ankle in his school robes, and you \\nmust need new ones too, Harry, you’ve grown so \\nmuch — come on, everyone — ” \\n\\n“Molly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to \\nMadam Malkin’s,” said Mr. Weasley. “Why don’t those \\nthree go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and \\nBlotts and get everyone’s schoolbooks?” \\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly \\ntorn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly \\nand the wish to stick together in a pack. “Hagrid, do \\nyou think — ?” \\n\\n“Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said Hagrid \\nsoothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin \\nlid. Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but \\nallowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish \\nand Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, \\nRon, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam \\nMalkin’s. \\n\\nHarry noticed that many of the people who passed \\nthem had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. \\nWeasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk \\nanymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own \\ntightly knit groups, moving intently about their \\nbusiness. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone. \\n\\n“Migh’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,” \\nsaid Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkin’s and \\nbending down to peer through the window. “I’ll stand \\nguard outside, all right?” \\n\\nSo Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop \\ntogether. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but \\nno sooner had the door swung shut behind them than \\nthey heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack \\nof dress robes in spangled green and blue. \\n\\nPage | 124 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"... not a child, in case you haven’t noticed, Mother. I \\nam perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.” \\n\\nThere was a clucking noise and a voice Harry \\nrecognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, \\n“Now, dear, your mother’s quite right, none of us is \\nsupposed to go wandering around on our own \\nanymore, it’s nothing to do with being a child — ” \\n\\n“Watch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!” \\n\\nA teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white- \\nblond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a \\nhandsome set of dark green robes that glittered with \\npins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He \\nstrode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a \\nfew moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray \\neyes narrowed. \\n\\n“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a \\nMudblood just walked in,” said Draco Malfoy. \\n\\n“I don’t think there’s any need for language like that!” \\nsaid Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the \\nclothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. \\n“And I don’t want wands drawn in my shop either!” \\nshe added hastily, for a glance toward the door had \\nshown her Harry and Ron both standing there with \\ntheir wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, \\nwho was standing slightly behind them, whispered, \\n“No, don’t, honestly, it’s not worth it. ...” \\n\\n“Yeah, like you’d dare do magic out of school,” \\nsneered Malfoy. “Who blacked your eye, Granger? I \\nwant to send them flowers.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 125 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply, \\nlooking over her shoulder for support. “Madam — \\nplease — ” \\n\\nNarcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes \\nrack. \\n\\n“Put those away,” she said coldly to Harry and Ron. \\n\\n“If you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is \\nthe last thing you ever do.” \\n\\n“Really?” said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing \\ninto the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, \\nstill resembled her sister’s. He was as tall as she was \\nnow. “Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, \\nare you?” \\n\\nMadam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart. \\n\\n“Really, you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to \\nsay — wands away, please!” \\n\\nBut Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy \\nsmiled unpleasantly. \\n\\n“I see that being Dumbledore’s favorite has given you \\na false sense of security, Harry Potter. But \\nDumbledore won’t always be there to protect you.” \\n\\nHarry looked mockingly all around the shop. “Wow ... \\nlook at that ... he’s not here now! So why not have a \\ngo? They might be able to find you a double cell in \\nAzkaban with your loser of a husband!” \\n\\nMalfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but \\nstumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly. \\n\\n“Don’t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!” \\nMalfoy snarled. \\n\\nPage | 126 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s all right, Draco,” said Narcissa, restraining him \\nwith her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. “I \\nexpect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I \\nam reunited with Lucius.” \\n\\nHarry raised his wand higher. \\n\\n“Harry, no!” moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and \\nattempting to push it down by his side. “Think. ... \\n\\nYou mustn’t. ... You’ll be in such trouble. ...” \\n\\nMadam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, \\nthen seemed to decide to act as though nothing was \\nhappening in the hope that it wouldn’t. She bent \\ntoward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry. \\n\\n“I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, \\ndear, let me just — ” \\n\\n“Ouch!” bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. \\n“Watch where you’re putting your pins, woman! \\nMother — I don’t think I want these anymore — ” \\n\\nHe pulled the robes over his head and threw them \\nonto the floor at Madam Malkin’s feet. \\n\\n“You’re right, Draco,” said Narcissa, with a \\ncontemptuous glance at Hermione, “now I know the \\nkind of scum that shops here. ... We’ll do better at \\nTwilfitt and Tatting’s.” \\n\\nAnd with that, the pair of them strode out of the \\nshop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could \\ninto Ron on the way out. \\n\\n“Well, reallyl” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the \\nfallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them \\nlike a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 127 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was distracted all through the fitting of Ron’s and \\nHarry’s new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizard’s \\ndress robes instead of witch’s, and when she finally \\nbowed them out of the shop it was with an air of \\nbeing glad to see the back of them. \\n\\n“Got ev’rything?” asked Hagrid brightly when they \\nreappeared at his side. \\n\\n“Just about,” said Harry. “Did you see the Malfoys?” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned. “Bu’ they wouldn’ \\ndare make trouble in the middle o’ Diagon Alley, \\nHarry. Don’ worry abou’ them.” \\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but \\nbefore they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable \\nnotion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared, all \\nclutching heavy packages of books. \\n\\n“Everyone all right?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Got your \\nrobes? Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary \\nand Eeylops on the way to Fred and George’s — stick \\nclose, now. ...” \\n\\nNeither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the \\nApothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying \\nPotions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for \\nHedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium. \\nThen, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every \\nminute or so, they headed farther along the street in \\nsearch of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop \\nrun by Fred and George. \\n\\n“We really haven’t got too long,” Mrs. Weasley said. \\n\\n“So we’ll just have a quick look around and then back \\nto the car. We must be close, that’s number ninety- \\ntwo ... ninety-four ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 128 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Whoa,” said Ron, stopping in his tracks. \\n\\nSet against the dull, poster-muffled shop fronts \\naround them, Fred and George’s windows hit the eye \\nlike a firework display. Casual passersby were looking \\nback over their shoulders at the windows, and a few \\nrather stunned-looking people had actually come to a \\nhalt, transfixed. The left-hand window was dazzlingly \\nfull of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, \\nflashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harry’s eyes began to \\nwater just looking at it. The right-hand window was \\ncovered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the \\nMinistry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters: \\n\\nWHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT \\n\\nYOU-KNOW-WHO? \\n\\nYOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT \\nU-NO-POO— \\n\\nTHE CONSTIPATION SENSATION \\nTHAT’S GRIPPING THE NATION! \\n\\nHarry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan \\nbeside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley \\ngazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved \\nsilently, mouthing the name “U-No-Poo.” \\n\\n“They’ll be murdered in their beds!” she whispered. \\n\\n“No they won’t!” said Ron, who, like Harry, was \\nlaughing. “This is brilliant!” \\n\\nAnd he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was \\npacked with customers; Harry could not get near the \\n\\nPage | 129 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes \\npiled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes \\nthat the twins had perfected during their last, \\nunfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the \\nNosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one \\nbattered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of \\ntrick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber \\nchickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most \\nexpensive beating the unwary user around the head \\nand neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self- \\nInking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. \\n\\nA space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his \\nway toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted \\nten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man \\nslowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, \\nboth perched on a box that read: REUSABLE \\nHANGMAN — SPELL IT OR HE’LL SWING! \\n\\n“ ‘Patented Daydream Charms . . . ’ ” \\n\\nHermione had managed to squeeze through to a large \\ndisplay near the counter and was reading the \\ninformation on the back of a box bearing a highly \\ncolored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning \\ngirl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. \\n\\n“ ‘One simple incantation and you will enter a top- \\nquality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy \\nto fit into the average school lesson and virtually \\nundetectable (side effects include vacant expression \\nand minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens.’ \\nYou know,” said Hermione, looking up at Harry, “that \\nreally is extraordinary magic!” \\n\\n“For that, Hermione,” said a voice behind them, “you \\ncan have one for free.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 130 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of \\nmagenta robes that clashed magnificently with his \\nflaming hair. \\n\\n“How are you, Harry?” They shook hands. “And \\nwhat’s happened to your eye, Hermione?” \\n\\n“Your punching telescope,” she said ruefully. \\n\\n“Oh blimey, I forgot about those,” said Fred. “Here — ” \\n\\nHe pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to \\nher; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow \\npaste. \\n\\n“Just dab it on, that bruise’ll be gone within the \\nhour,” said Fred. “We had to find a decent bruise \\nremover. We’re testing most of our products on \\nourselves.” \\n\\nHermione looked nervous. “It is safe, isn’t it?” she \\nasked. \\n\\n“ ’Course it is,” said Fred bracingly. “Come on, Harry, \\nI’ll give you a tour.” \\n\\nHarry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste \\nand followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where \\nhe saw a stand of card and rope tricks. \\n\\n“Muggle magic tricks!” said Fred happily, pointing \\nthem out. “For freaks like Dad, you know, who love \\nMuggle stuff. It’s not a big earner, but we do fairly \\nsteady business, they’re great novelties. ... Oh, here’s \\nGeorge. ...” \\n\\nFred’s twin shook Harry’s hand energetically. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 131 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, \\nthat’s where we’re making the real money — pocket \\nanything, you, and you’ll pay in more than GalleonsV’ \\nhe added warningly to a small boy who hastily \\nwhipped his hand out of the tub labeled EDIBLE \\nDARK MARKS — THEY’LL MAKE ANYONE SICK! \\n\\nGeorge pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle \\ntricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. \\nThe packaging on the products lining these shelves \\nwas more subdued. \\n\\n“We’ve just developed this more serious line,” said \\nFred. “Funny how it happened ...” \\n\\n“You wouldn’t believe how many people, even people \\nwho work at the Ministry, can’t do a decent Shield \\nCharm,” said George. “ ’Course, they didn’t have you \\nteaching them, Harry.” \\n\\n“That’s right. ... Well, we thought Shield Hats were a \\nbit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx \\nyou while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx \\njust bounces off. But the Ministry bought five \\nhundred for all its support staff! And we’re still \\ngetting massive orders!” \\n\\n“So we’ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, \\nShield Gloves ...” \\n\\n\"... I mean, they wouldn’t help much against the \\nUnforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes \\nor jinxes ...” \\n\\n“And then we thought we’d get into the whole area of \\nDefense Against the Dark Arts, because it’s such a \\nmoney spinner,” continued George enthusiastically. \\n“This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we’re \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 132 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nimporting it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a \\nquick escape.” \\n\\n“And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the \\nshelves, look,” said Fred, pointing at a number of \\nweird-looking black horn-type objects that were \\nindeed attempting to scurry out of sight. “You just \\ndrop one surreptitiously and it’ll run off and make a \\nnice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if \\nyou need one. \\n\\n“Handy,” said Harry, impressed. \\n\\n“Here,” said George, catching a couple and throwing \\nthem to Harry. \\n\\nA young witch with short blonde hair poked her head \\naround the curtain; Harry saw that she too was \\nwearing magenta staff robes. \\n\\n“There’s a customer out here looking for a joke \\ncauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,” she said. \\n\\nHarry found it very odd to hear Fred and George \\ncalled “Mr. Weasley,” but they took it in their stride. \\n\\n“Right you are, Verity, I’m coming,” said George \\npromptly. “Harry, you help yourself to anything you \\nwant, all right? No charge.” \\n\\n“I can’t do that!” said Harry, who had already pulled \\nout his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators. \\n\\n“You don’t pay here,” said Fred firmly, waving away \\nHarry’s gold. \\n\\n“But — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 133 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You gave us our start-up loan, we haven’t forgotten,” \\nsaid George sternly. “Take whatever you like, and just \\nremember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.” \\n\\nGeorge swept off through the curtain to help with the \\ncustomers, and Fred led Harry back into the main \\npart of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still \\nporing over the Patented Daydream Charms. \\n\\n“Haven’t you girls found our special WonderWitch \\nproducts yet?” asked Fred. “Follow me, ladies. ...” \\n\\nNear the window was an array of violently pink \\nproducts around which a cluster of excited girls was \\ngiggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both \\nhung back, looking wary. \\n\\n“There you go,” said Fred proudly. “Best range of love \\npotions you’ll find anywhere.” \\n\\nGinny raised an eyebrow skeptically. “Do they work?” \\nshe asked. \\n\\n“Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a \\ntime depending on the weight of the boy in question \\n\\n\\n\\n“ — and the attractiveness of the girl,” said George, \\nreappearing suddenly at their side. “But we’re not \\nselling them to our sister,” he added, becoming \\nsuddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about five \\nboys on the go from what we’ve — ” \\n\\n“Whatever you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said \\nGinny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink \\npot off the shelf. “What’s this?” \\n\\n“Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,” said Fred. \\n“Excellent on everything from boils to blackheads, but \\n\\nPage | 134 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndon’t change the subject. Are you or are you not \\ncurrently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?” \\n\\n“Yes, I am,” said Ginny. “And last time I looked, he \\nwas definitely one boy, not five. What are those?” \\n\\nShe was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff \\nin shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the \\nbottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. \\n\\n“Pygmy Puffs,” said George. “Miniature puffskeins, we \\ncan’t breed them fast enough. So what about Michael \\nCorner?” \\n\\n“I dumped him, he was a bad loser,” said Ginny, \\nputting a finger through the bars of the cage and \\nwatching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. “They’re \\nreally cute!” \\n\\n“They’re fairly cuddly, yes,” conceded Fred. “But \\nyou’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren’t \\nyou?” \\n\\nGinny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. \\nThere was such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face \\nthat Harry was surprised Fred didn’t recoil. \\n\\n“It’s none of your business. And I’ll thank you,” she \\nadded angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at \\nGeorge’s elbow, laden with merchandise, “not to tell \\ntales about me to these two!” \\n\\n“That’s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,” said \\nFred, examining the many boxes in Ron’s arms. \\n“Cough up.” \\n\\n“I’m your brother!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 135 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And that’s our stuff you’re nicking. Three Galleons, \\nnine Sickles. I’ll knock off the Knut.” \\n\\n“But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!” \\n\\n“You’d better put it back then, and mind you put it on \\nthe right shelves.” \\n\\nRon dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude \\nhand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted \\nby Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to \\nappear. \\n\\n“If I see you do that again I’ll jinx your fingers \\ntogether,” she said sharply. \\n\\n“Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?” said Ginny at once. \\n“A what?” said Mrs. Weasley warily. \\n\\n“Look, they’re so sweet. ...” \\n\\nMrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, \\nand Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an \\nunimpeded view out of the window. Draco Malfoy was \\nhurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys’ \\nWizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. \\nSeconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the \\nwindow and they lost sight of him. \\n\\n“Wonder where his mummy is?” said Harry, frowning. \\n\\n“Given her the slip by the looks of it,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Why, though?” said Hermione. \\n\\nHarry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. \\n\\nNarcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son \\nout of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a \\n\\nPage | 136 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreal effort to free himself from her clutches. Harry, \\nknowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason \\ncould not be innocent. \\n\\nHe glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were \\nbending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was \\ndelightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked \\nplaying cards. Fred and George were both helping \\ncustomers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was \\nstanding with his back to them, looking up and down \\nthe street. \\n\\n“Get under here, quick,” said Harry, pulling his \\nInvisibility Cloak out of his bag. \\n\\n“Oh — I don’t know, Harry,” said Hermione, looking \\nuncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley. \\n\\n“Come on\\\\” said Ron. \\n\\nShe hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under \\nthe cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them \\nvanish; they were all too interested in Fred and \\nGeorge’s products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione \\nsqueezed their way out of the door as quickly as they \\ncould, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy \\nhad disappeared just as successfully as they had. \\n\\n“He was going in that direction,” murmured Harry as \\nquietly as possible, so that the humming Hagrid \\nwould not hear them. “C’mon.” \\n\\nThey scurried along, peering left and right, through \\nshop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed \\nahead. \\n\\n“That’s him, isn’t it?” she whispered. “Turning left?” \\n“Big surprise,” whispered Ron. \\n\\nPage | 137 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into \\nKnockturn Alley and out of sight. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Quick, or we’ll lose him,” said Harry, speeding up. \\n\\n“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the \\ncloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much \\nmore difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak \\nnowadays. \\n\\n“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry impatiently. “Just \\nhurry!” \\n\\nBut Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the \\nDark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered \\ninto windows as they passed, but none of the shops \\nseemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed \\nit was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and \\nsuspicious times to buy Dark artifacts — or at least, \\nto be seen buying them. \\n\\nHermione gave his arm a hard pinch. \\n\\n“Ouch!” \\n\\n“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Harry’s \\near. \\n\\nThey had drawn level with the only shop in \\nKnockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin \\nand Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister \\nobjects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls \\nand old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to \\nthem, just visible beyond the very same large black \\ncabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid \\nMalfoy and his father. Judging by the movements of \\nMalfoy’s hands, he was talking animatedly. The \\nproprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 138 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstooping man, stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a \\ncurious expression of mingled resentment and fear. \\n\\n\\n\\n“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said \\nHermione. \\n\\n“We can!” said Ron excitedly. “Hang on — damn — ” \\n\\nHe dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still \\nclutching as he fumbled with the largest. \\n\\n“Extendable Ears, look!” \\n\\n“Fantastic!” said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the \\nlong, fleshcolored strings and began to feed them \\ntoward the bottom of the door. “Oh, I hope the door \\nisn’t Imperturbable — ” \\n\\n“No!” said Ron gleefully. “Listen!” \\n\\nThey put their heads together and listened intently to \\nthe ends of the strings, through which Malfoy’s voice \\ncould be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had \\nbeen turned on. \\n\\n\"... you know how to fix it?” \\n\\n“Possibly,” said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he \\nwas unwilling to commit himself. “I’ll need to see it, \\nthough. Why don’t you bring it into the shop?” \\n\\n“I can’t,” said Malfoy. “It’s got to stay put. I just need \\nyou to tell me how to do it.” \\n\\nHarry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously. \\n\\n“Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very \\ndifficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn’t guarantee \\nanything.” \\n\\nPage | 139 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No?” said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, \\nthat Malfoy was sneering. “Perhaps this will make you \\nmore confident.” \\n\\nHe moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view \\nby the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled \\nsideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they \\ncould see was Borgin, looking very frightened. \\n\\n“Tell anyone,” said Malfoy, “and there will be \\nretribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He’s a family \\nfriend. He’ll be dropping in from time to time to make \\nsure you’re giving the problem your full attention.” \\n\\n“There will be no need for — ” \\n\\n“I’ll decide that,” said Malfoy. “Well, I’d better be off. \\nAnd don’t forget to keep that one safe, I’ll need it.” \\n\\n“Perhaps you’d like to take it now?” \\n\\n“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man, how \\nwould I look carrying that down the street? Just don’t \\nsell it.” \\n\\n“Of course not ... sir.” \\n\\nBorgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had \\nonce seen him give Lucius Malfoy. \\n\\n“Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my \\nmother, understand?” \\n\\n“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Borgin, bowing \\nagain. \\n\\nNext moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as \\nMalfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased \\nwith himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and \\n\\nPage | 140 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their \\nknees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; \\nhis unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried. \\n\\n“What was that about?” whispered Ron, reeling in the \\nExtendable Ears. \\n\\n“Dunno,” said Harry, thinking hard. “He wants \\nsomething mended . . . and he wants to reserve \\nsomething in there. ... Could you see what he pointed \\nat when he said ‘that one’?” \\n\\n“No, he was behind that cabinet — ” \\n\\n“You two stay here,” whispered Hermione. \\n\\n“What are you — ?” \\n\\nBut Hermione had already ducked out from under the \\ncloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the \\nglass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell \\ntinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears \\nback under the door and passed one of the strings to \\nHarry. \\n\\n“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” Hermione said \\nbrightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a \\nsuspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled \\nthrough the jumble of objects on display. \\n\\n“Is this necklace for sale?” she asked, pausing beside \\na glass-fronted case. \\n\\n“If you’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,” said \\nMr. Borgin coldly. \\n\\n“Oh — er — no, I haven’t got quite that much,” said \\nHermione, walking on. “And ... what about this lovely \\n— um — skull?” \\n\\nPage | 141 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sixteen Galleons.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“So it’s for sale, then? It isn’t being ... kept for \\nanyone?” \\n\\nMr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty \\nfeeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. \\nApparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too \\nbecause she suddenly threw caution to the winds. \\n\\n“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just \\nnow, Draco Malfoy, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I \\nwant to get him a birthday present, but if he’s already \\nreserved anything, I obviously don’t want to get him \\nthe same thing, so ... um ...” \\n\\nIt was a pretty lame story in Harry’s opinion, and \\napparently Borgin thought so too. \\n\\n“Out,” he said sharply. “Get out!” \\n\\nHermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried \\nto the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell \\ntinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her \\nand put up the closed sign. \\n\\n“Ah well,” said Ron, throwing the cloak back over \\nHermione. “Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious — \\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, next time you can show me how it’s done, \\nMaster of Mystery!” she snapped. \\n\\nRon and Hermione bickered all the way back to \\nWeasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to \\nstop so that they could dodge undetected around a \\nvery anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who \\nhad clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, \\nHarry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his \\nPage | 142 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbag, and joined in with the other two when they \\ninsisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasley’s accusations, \\nthat they had been in the back room all along, and \\nthat she could not have looked properly. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 143 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SLUG CLUB \\n\\nHarry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays \\npondering the meaning of Malfoy’s behavior in \\nKnockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the \\nsatisfied look on Malfoy’s face as he had left the shop. \\nNothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be \\ngood news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither \\nRon nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about \\nMalfoy’s activities as he was; or at least, they seemed \\nto get bored of discussing it after a few days. \\n\\n“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,” said \\nHermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the \\nwindowsill in Fred and George’s room with her feet up \\non one of the cardboard boxes and had only \\ngrudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced \\nRune Translation. “But haven’t we agreed there could \\nbe a lot of explanations?” \\n\\n“Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory,” said Ron \\nvaguely, as he attempted to straighten his \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 144 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nbroomstick’s bent tail twigs. “Remember that \\nshriveled-up arm Malfoy had?” \\n\\n“But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep \\nthat one safe’?” asked Harry for the umpteenth time. \\n“That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of \\nthe broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.” \\n\\n“You reckon?” said Ron, now trying to scrape some \\ndirt off his broom handle. \\n\\n“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. When neither Ron nor \\nHermione answered, he said, “Malfoy’s father’s in \\nAzkaban. Don’t you think Malfoy’d like revenge?” \\n\\nRon looked up, blinking. \\n\\n“Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?” \\n\\n“That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, \\nfrustrated. “But he’s up to something and I think we \\nshould take it seriously. His father’s a Death Eater \\nand — ” \\n\\nHarry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind \\nHermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had \\njust occurred to him. \\n\\n“Harry?” said Hermione in an anxious voice. “What’s \\nwrong?” \\n\\n“Your scar’s not hurting again, is it?” asked Ron \\nnervously. \\n\\n“He’s a Death Eater,” said Harry slowly. “He’s \\nreplaced his father as a Death Eater!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 145 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. \\n“Malfoy? He’s sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know- \\nWho would let Malfoy join?” \\n\\n“It seems very unlikely, Harry,” said Hermione in a \\nrepressive sort of voice. “What makes you think — ?” \\n\\n“In Madam Malkin’s. She didn’t touch him, but he \\nyelled and jerked his arm away from her when she \\nwent to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He’s \\nbeen branded with the Dark Mark.” \\n\\nRon and Hermione looked at each other. \\n\\n“Well ...” said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced. \\n\\n“I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,” \\nsaid Hermione. \\n\\n“He showed Borgin something we couldn’t see,” Harry \\npressed on stubbornly. “Something that seriously \\nscared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it — he was \\nshowing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw \\nhow seriously Borgin took him!” \\n\\nRon and Hermione exchanged another look. \\n\\n“I’m not sure, Harry. ...” \\n\\n“Yeah, I still don’t reckon You-Know-Who would let \\nMalfoy join. ...” \\n\\nAnnoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, \\n\\nHarry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and \\nleft the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for \\ndays not to leave their washing and packing until the \\nlast moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, \\nwho was returning to her room carrying a pile of \\nfreshly laundered clothes. \\n\\nPage | 146 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now,” she warned \\nhim. “There’s a lot of Phlegm around.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll be careful not to slip in it.” Harry smiled. \\n\\nSure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to \\nfind Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow \\nabout plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. \\nWeasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, \\nlooking bad-tempered. \\n\\n“... Bill and I ’ave almost decided on only two \\nbridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet \\ntogezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold \\n— pink would of course be ’orrible with Ginny’s ’air — \\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah, Harry!” said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across \\nFleur’s monologue. “Good, I wanted to explain about \\nthe security arrangements for the journey to \\nHogwarts tomorrow. We’ve got Ministry cars again, \\nand there will be Aurors waiting at the station — ” \\n\\n“Is Tonks going to be there?” asked Harry, handing \\nover his Quidditch things. \\n\\n“No, I don’t think so, she’s been stationed somewhere \\nelse from what Arthur said.” \\n\\n“She has let ’erself go, zat Tonks,” Fleur mused, \\nexamining her own stunning reflection in the back of \\na teaspoon. “A big mistake if you ask — ” \\n\\n“Yes, thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting \\nacross Fleur again. “You’d better get on, Harry, I want \\nthe trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don’t have \\nthe usual last-minute scramble.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 147 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd in fact, their departure the following morning was \\nsmoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to \\nthe front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks \\npacked; Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed \\nin his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron’s owl, \\nPigwidgeon; and Ginny’s new purple Pygmy Puff, \\nArnold, in cages. \\n\\n“Au revoir, ’Ariy,” said Fleur throatily, kissing him \\ngood-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but \\nGinny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in \\nthe dust at Fleur’s feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt- \\nspattered, he hurried into the car without saying \\ngood-bye. \\n\\nThere was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at \\nKing’s Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, \\nbearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward \\nthe moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, \\nmarched them into the station without speaking. \\n\\n“Quick, quick, through the barrier,” said Mrs. \\n\\nWeasley, who seemed a little flustered by this austere \\nefficiency. “Harry had better go first, with — ” \\n\\nShe looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who \\nnodded briefly, seized Harry’s upper arm, and \\nattempted to steer him toward the barrier between \\nplatforms nine and ten. \\n\\n“I can walk, thanks,” said Harry irritably, jerking his \\narm out of the Auror’s grip. He pushed his trolley \\ndirectly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent \\ncompanion, and found himself, a second later, \\nstanding on platform nine and three-quarters, where \\nthe scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam \\nover the crowd. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 148 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione and the Weasleys joined him within \\nseconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced \\nAuror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow \\nhim up the platform, looking for an empty \\ncompartment. \\n\\n“We can’t, Harry,” said Hermione, looking apologetic. \\n“Ron and I’ve got to go to the prefects’ carriage first \\nand then patrol the corridors for a bit.” \\n\\n“Oh yeah, I forgot,” said Harry. \\n\\n“You’d better get straight on the train, all of you, \\nyou’ve only got a few minutes to go,” said Mrs. \\nWeasley, consulting her watch. “Well, have a lovely \\nterm, Ron. ...” \\n\\n“Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?” said Harry, \\nmaking up his mind on the spur of the moment. \\n\\n“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly \\nsurprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the \\nothers nevertheless. \\n\\nHarry had thought it through carefully and come to \\nthe conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. \\nWeasley was the right person; firstly, because he \\nworked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best \\nposition to make further investigations, and secondly, \\nbecause he thought that there was not too much risk \\nof Mr. Weasley exploding with anger. \\n\\nHe could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror \\ncasting the pair of them suspicious looks as they \\nmoved away. \\n\\n“When we were in Diagon Alley,” Harry began, but Mr. \\nWeasley forestalled him with a grimace. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 149 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and \\nHermione disappeared to while you were supposed to \\nbe in the back room of Fred and George’s shop?” \\n\\n“How did you — ?” \\n\\n“Harry, please. You’re talking to the man who raised \\nFred and George.” \\n\\n“Er ... yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.” \\n\\n“Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.” \\n\\n“Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my \\nInvisibility Cloak.” \\n\\n“Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or \\nwas it a mere whim?” \\n\\n“Because I thought Malfoy was up to something,” said \\nHarry, disregarding Mr. Weasley’s look of mingled \\nexasperation and amusement. “He’d given his mother \\nthe slip and I wanted to know why.” \\n\\n“Of course you did,” said Mr. Weasley, sounding \\nresigned. “Well? Did you find out why?” \\n\\n“He went into Borgin and Burkes,” said Harry, “and \\nstarted bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help \\nhim fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to \\nkeep something else for him. He made it sound like it \\nwas the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like \\nthey were a pair. And ...” \\n\\nHarry took a deep breath. \\n\\n“There’s something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a \\nmile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 150 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthink he’s been branded with the Dark Mark. I think \\nhe’s replaced his father as a Death Eater.” \\n\\nMr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he \\nsaid, “Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would \\nallow a sixteen-year-old — ” \\n\\n“Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would \\nor wouldn’t do?” asked Harry angrily. “Mr. Weasley, \\nI’m sorry, but isn’t it worth investigating? If Malfoy \\nwants something fixing, and he needs to threaten \\nBorgin to get it done, it’s probably something Dark or \\ndangerous, isn’t it?” \\n\\n“I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley \\nslowly. “You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, \\nwe raided his house. We took away everything that \\nmight have been dangerous.” \\n\\n“I think you missed something,” said Harry \\nstubbornly. \\n\\n“Well, maybe,” said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell \\nthat Mr. Weasley was humoring him. \\n\\nThere was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone \\nhad boarded the train and the doors were closing. \\n\\n“You’d better hurry,” said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. \\nWeasley cried, “Harry, quickly!” \\n\\nHe hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped \\nhim load his trunk onto the train. \\n\\n“Now, dear, you’re coming to us for Christmas, it’s all \\nfixed with Dumbledore, so we’ll see you quite soon,” \\nsaid Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry \\nslammed the door shut behind him and the train \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 151 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbegan to move. “You make sure you look after \\nyourself and — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nThe train was gathering speed. \\n\\n“ — be good and — ” \\n\\nShe was jogging to keep up now. \\nstay safe!” \\n\\nHarry waved until the train had turned a corner and \\nMr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned \\nto see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron \\nand Hermione were cloistered in the prefects’ \\ncarriage, but Ginny was a little way along the \\ncorridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way \\ntoward her, dragging his trunk. \\n\\nPeople stared shamelessly as he approached. They \\neven pressed their faces against the windows of their \\ncompartments to get a look at him. He had expected \\nan upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he \\nwould have to endure this term after all the “Chosen \\nOne” rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not \\nenjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright \\nspotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder. \\n\\n“Fancy trying to find a compartment?” \\n\\n“I can’t, Harry, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny \\nbrightly. “See you later.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of \\nannoyance as she walked away, her long red hair \\ndancing behind her; he had become so used to her \\npresence over the summer that he had almost \\nforgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, \\nRon, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked \\nPage | 152 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand looked around: He was surrounded by \\nmesmerized girls. \\n\\n“Hi, Harry!” said a familiar voice from behind him. \\n\\n“Neville!” said Harry in relief, turning to see a round- \\nfaced boy struggling toward him. \\n\\n“Hello, Harry,” said a girl with long hair and large \\nmisty eyes, who was just behind Neville. \\n\\n“Luna, hi, how are you?” \\n\\n“Very well, thank you,” said Luna. She was clutching \\na magazine to her chest; large letters on the front \\nannounced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs \\ninside. \\n\\n“Quibbler still going strong, then?” asked Harry, who \\nfelt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given \\nit an exclusive interview the previous year. \\n\\n“Oh yes, circulation’s well up,” said Luna happily. \\n\\n“Let’s find seats,” said Harry, and the three of them \\nset off along the train through hordes of silently \\nstaring students. At last they found an empty \\ncompartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully. \\n\\n“They’re even staring at us!” said Neville, indicating \\nhimself and Luna. “Because we’re with you!” \\n\\n“They’re staring at you because you were at the \\nMinistry too,” said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into \\nthe luggage rack. “Our little adventure there was all \\nover the Daily Prophet, you must’ve seen it.” \\n\\n“Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the \\npublicity,” said Neville, “but she was really pleased. \\n\\nPage | 153 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSays I’m starting to live up to my dad at long last. She \\nbought me a new wand, look!” \\n\\n\\n\\nHe pulled it out and showed it to Harry. \\n\\n“Cherry and unicorn hair,” he said proudly. “We think \\nit was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he \\nvanished next day — oi, come back here, Trevor!” \\n\\nAnd he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it \\nmade one of its frequent bids for freedom. \\n\\n“Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?” \\nasked Luna, who was detaching a pair of psychedelic \\nspectacles from the middle of The Quibbler. \\n\\n“No point now we’ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?” \\nsaid Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head \\nagainst the seat as he emerged from under it. He \\nlooked most disappointed. \\n\\n“I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!” \\n\\n“I enjoyed the meetings too,” said Luna serenely. “It \\nwas like having friends.” \\n\\nThis was one of those uncomfortable things Luna \\noften said and which made Harry feel a squirming \\nmixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could \\nrespond, however, there was a disturbance outside \\ntheir compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls \\nwas whispering and giggling together on the other \\nside of the glass. \\n\\n“You ask him!” \\n\\n“No, you!” \\n\\n“I’ll do it!” \\n\\nPage | 154 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark \\neyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed \\nher way through the door. \\n\\n“Hi, Harry, I’m Romilda, Romilda Vane,” she said \\nloudly and confidently. “Why don’t you join us in our \\ncompartment? You don’t have to sit with them,” she \\nadded in a stage whisper, indicating Neville’s bottom, \\nwhich was sticking out from under the seat again as \\nhe groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now \\nwearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the \\nlook of a demented, multicolored owl. \\n\\n“They’re friends of mine,” said Harry coldly. \\n\\n“Oh,” said the girl, looking very surprised. “Oh. \\n\\nOkay.” \\n\\nAnd she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her. \\n\\n“People expect you to have cooler friends than us,” \\nsaid Luna, once again displaying her knack for \\nembarrassing honesty. \\n\\n“You are cool,” said Harry shortly. “None of them was \\nat the Ministry. They didn’t fight with me.” \\n\\n“That’s a very nice thing to say,” beamed Luna. Then \\nshe pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and \\nsettled down to read The Quibbler. \\n\\n“We didn’t face him, though,” said Neville, emerging \\nfrom under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair \\nand a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. “You did. \\nYou should hear my gran talk about you. ‘That Harry \\nPotter’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of \\nMagic put together*.’ She’d give anything to have you \\nas a grandson. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 155 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry laughed uncomfortably and changed the \\nsubject to O.W.L. results as soon as he could. While \\nNeville recited his grades and wondered aloud \\nwhether he would be allowed to take a \\nTransfiguration N.E.W.T. with only an “Acceptable,” \\nHarry watched him without really listening. \\n\\nNeville’s childhood had been blighted by Voldemort \\njust as much as Harry’s had, but Neville had no idea \\nhow close he had come to having Harry’s destiny. The \\nprophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, \\nfor his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had \\nchosen to believe that Harry was the one meant. \\n\\nHad Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville \\nsitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped \\nscar and the weight of the prophecy. ... Or would it? \\nWould Neville’s mother have died to save him, as Lily \\nhad died for Harry? Surely she would. ... But what if \\nshe had been unable to stand between her son and \\nVoldemort? Would there then have been no “Chosen \\nOne” at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and \\na scarless Harry who would have been kissed good- \\nbye by his own mother, not Ron’s? \\n\\n“You all right, Harry? You look funny,” said Neville. \\n\\nHarry started. “Sorry — I — ” \\n\\n“Wrackspurt got you?” asked Luna sympathetically, \\npeering at Harry through her enormous colored \\nspectacles. \\n\\n“I — what?” \\n\\n“A Wrackspurt ... They’re invisible. They float in \\nthrough your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she \\nsaid. “I thought I felt one zooming around in here.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 156 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating \\noff large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught \\neach other’s eyes and hastily began to talk of \\nQuidditch. \\n\\nThe weather beyond the train windows was as patchy \\nas it had been all summer; they passed through \\nstretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, \\nclear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, \\nwhen the sun was visible almost directly overhead, \\nthat Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at \\nlast. \\n\\n“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,” \\nsaid Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside \\nHarry and rubbing his stomach. “Hi, Neville. Hi, \\n\\nLuna. Guess what?” he added, turning to Harry. \\n“Malfoy’s not doing prefect duty. He’s just sitting in \\nhis compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw \\nhim when we passed.” \\n\\nHarry sat up straight, interested. It was not like \\nMalfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his \\npower as prefect, which he had happily abused all the \\nprevious year. \\n\\n“What did he do when he saw you?” \\n\\n“The usual,” said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a \\nrude hand gesture. “Not like him, though, is it? Well \\n— that is” — he did the hand gesture again — “but \\nwhy isn’t he out there bullying first years? \\n\\n“Dunno,” said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn’t \\nthis look as though Malfoy had more important things \\non his mind than bullying younger students? \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 157 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,” said \\nHermione. “Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame \\nafter that.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said Harry. “I think he’s — ” \\n\\nBut before he could expound on his theory, the \\ncompartment door slid open again and a breathless \\nthird -year girl stepped inside. \\n\\n“I’m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom \\nand Harry P-Potter,” she faltered, as her eyes met \\nHarry’s and she turned scarlet. She was holding out \\ntwo scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. \\nPerplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed \\nto each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the \\ncompartment. \\n\\n“What is it?” Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his. \\n“An invitation,” said Harry. \\n\\nHarry, \\n\\nI would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of \\nlunch in compartment C. \\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\nProfessor H. E. F. Slug horn \\n\\n“Who’s Professor Slughorn?” asked Neville, looking \\nperplexedly at his own invitation. \\n\\n“New teacher,” said Harry. “Well, I suppose we’ll have \\nto go, won’t we?” \\n\\n“But what does he want me for?” asked Neville \\nnervously, as though he was expecting detention. \\n\\nPage | 158 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No idea,” said Harry, which was not entirely true, \\nthough he had no proof yet that his hunch was \\ncorrect. “Listen,” he added, seized by a sudden brain \\nwave, “let’s go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we \\nmight get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what \\nhe’s up to.” \\n\\nThis idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, \\nwhich were packed with people on the lookout for the \\nlunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while \\nwearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in \\nhis bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to \\nwear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to \\nhave increased in intensity even since he had last \\nwalked down the train. Every now and then, students \\nwould hurtle out of their compartments to get a better \\nlook at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who \\ndarted into her compartment when she saw Harry \\ncoming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her \\ndeep in determined conversation with her friend \\nMarietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of \\nmakeup that did not entirely obscure the odd \\nformation of pimples still etched across her face. \\nSmirking slightly, Harry pushed on. \\n\\nWhen they reached compartment C, they saw at once \\nthat they were not Slughorn’s only invitees, although \\njudging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn’s welcome, \\nHarry was the most warmly anticipated. \\n\\n“Harry, m’boy!” said Slughorn, jumping up at the \\nsight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly \\nseemed to fill all the remaining space in the \\ncompartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery \\nmustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the \\ngolden buttons on his waistcoat. “Good to see you, \\ngood to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 159 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from \\nSlughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the \\nonly two empty seats, which were nearest the door. \\nHarry glanced around at their fellow guests. He \\nrecognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy \\nwith high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there \\nwere also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know \\nand, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and \\nlooking as though she was not entirely sure how she \\nhad got there, Ginny. \\n\\n“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked Harry \\nand Neville. “Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course — \\n\\n\\n\\nZabini did not make any sign of recognition or \\ngreeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and \\nSlytherin students loathed each other on principle. \\n\\n“This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you’ve come \\nacross each other — ? No?” \\n\\nMcLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, \\nand Harry and Neville nodded back at him. \\n\\n“ — and this is Marcus Belby, I don’t know whether — \\n?” \\n\\nBelby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a \\nstrained smile. \\n\\n“ — and this charming young lady tells me she knows \\nyou!” Slughorn finished. \\n\\nGinny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind \\nSlughorn’s back. \\n\\n“Well now, this is most pleasant,” said Slughorn \\ncozily. “A chance to get to know you all a little better. \\n\\nPage | 160 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, take a napkin. I’ve packed my own lunch; the \\ntrolley, as I remember it, is heavy on licorice wands, \\nand a poor old man’s digestive system isn’t quite up \\nto such things. ... Pheasant, Belby?” \\n\\nBelby started and accepted what looked like half a \\ncold pheasant. \\n\\n“I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the \\npleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,” Slughorn \\ntold Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket \\nof rolls. “Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his \\nOrder of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much \\nof your uncle, Marcus?” \\n\\nUnfortunately, Belby had just taken a large mouthful \\nof pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he \\nswallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to \\nchoke. \\n\\n“Anapneo,” said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand \\nat Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once. \\n\\n“Not ... not much of him, no,” gasped Belby, his eyes \\nstreaming. \\n\\n“Well, of course, I daresay he’s busy,” said Slughorn, \\nlooking questioningly at Belby. “I doubt he invented \\nthe Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard \\nwork!” \\n\\n“I suppose ...” said Belby, who seemed afraid to take \\nanother bite of pheasant until he was sure that \\nSlughorn had finished with him. “Er ... he and my \\ndad don’t get on very well, you see, so I don’t really \\nknow much about ...” \\n\\nHis voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold \\nsmile and turned to McLaggen instead. \\n\\nPage | 161 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, you, Cormac,” said Slughorn, “I happen to \\nknow you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he \\nhas a rather splendid picture of the two of you \\nhunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?” \\n\\n“Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,” said McLaggen. \\n“We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour — \\nthis was before he became Minister, obviously — ” \\n\\n“Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?” beamed \\nSlughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; \\nsomehow, Belby was missed out. “Now tell me ...” \\n\\nIt was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed \\nto have been invited because they were connected to \\nsomebody well-known or influential — everyone \\nexcept Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after \\nMcLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful \\nwitch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, \\nshe had been married seven times, each of her \\nhusbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds \\nof gold). It was Neville’s turn next: This was a very \\nuncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville’s parents, well- \\nknown Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by \\nBellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater \\ncronies. At the end of Neville’s interview, Harry had \\nthe impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment \\non Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his \\nparents’ flair. \\n\\n“And now,” said Slughorn, shifting massively in his \\nseat with the air of a compere introducing his star \\nact. “Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely \\nscratched the surface when we met over the summer!” \\nHe contemplated Harry for a moment as though he \\nwas a particularly large and succulent piece of \\npheasant, then said, “ The Chosen One,’ they’re \\ncalling you now!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 162 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini \\nwere all staring at him. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course,” said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, \\n“there have been rumors for years. ... I remember \\nwhen — well — after that terrible night — Lily — \\nJames — and you survived — and the word was that \\nyou must have powers beyond the ordinary — ” \\n\\nZabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly \\nsupposed to indicate amused skepticism. An angry \\nvoice burst out from behind Slughorn. \\n\\n“Yeah, Zabini, because you’re so talented ... at posing. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh dear!” chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking \\naround at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around \\nSlughorn ’s great belly. “You want to be careful, Blaise! \\nI saw this young lady perform the most marvelous \\nBat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I \\nwouldn’t cross her!” \\n\\nZabini merely looked contemptuous. \\n\\n“Anyway,” said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. \\n\\n“Such rumors this summer. Of course, one doesn’t \\nknow what to believe, the Prophet has been known to \\nprint inaccuracies, make mistakes — but there seems \\nlittle doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there \\nwas quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you \\nwere there in the thick of it all!” \\n\\nHarry, who could not see any way out of this without \\nflatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn \\nbeamed at him. \\n\\n“So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so \\nfond — you were there, then? But the rest of the \\n\\nPage | 163 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstories — so sensational, of course, one doesn’t know \\nquite what to believe — this fabled prophecy, for \\ninstance — ” \\n\\n“We never heard a prophecy,” said Neville, turning \\ngeranium pink as he said it. \\n\\n“That’s right,” said Ginny staunchly. “Neville and I \\nwere both there too, and all this ‘Chosen One’ rubbish \\nis just the Prophet making things up as usual.” \\n\\n“You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn \\nwith great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but \\nboth of them sat clamlike before his encouraging \\nsmile. \\n\\n“Yes . . . well ... it is true that the Prophet often \\nexaggerates, of course. ...” Slughorn said, sounding a \\nlittle disappointed. “I remember dear Gwenog telling \\nme (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the \\nHolyhead Harpies) — ” \\n\\nHe meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, \\nbut Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn \\nhad not finished with him, and that he had not been \\nconvinced by Neville and Ginny. \\n\\nThe afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about \\nillustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom \\nhad been delighted to join what he called the “Slug \\nClub” at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but \\ncouldn’t see how to do so politely. Finally the train \\nemerged from yet another long misty stretch into a \\nred sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in \\nthe twilight. \\n\\n“Good gracious, it’s getting dark already! I didn’t \\nnotice that they’d lit the lamps! You’d better go and \\nchange into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you \\n\\nPage | 164 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmust drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. \\n\\nHarry, Blaise — any time you’re passing. Same goes \\nfor you, miss,” he twinkled at Ginny. “Well, off you go, \\noff you go!” \\n\\nAs he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, \\nZabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with \\ninterest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back \\nalong the train. \\n\\n“I’m glad that’s over,” muttered Neville. “Strange man, \\nisn’t he?” \\n\\n“Yeah, he is a bit,” said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. \\n“How come you ended up in there, Ginny?” \\n\\n“He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said Ginny. “You \\nremember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the \\nD.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened \\nat the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so \\nmuch I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I \\nthought I was going to get detention, but he just \\nthought it was a really good hex and invited me to \\nlunch! Mad, eh?” \\n\\n“Better reason for inviting someone than because \\ntheir mother’s famous,” said Harry, scowling at the \\nback of Zabini ’s head, “or because their uncle — ” \\n\\nBut he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a \\nreckless but potentially wonderful idea. ... In a \\nminute’s time, Zabini was going to reenter the \\nSlytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy would \\nbe sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody \\nexcept fellow Slytherins. ... If Harry could only enter, \\nunseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? \\nTrue, there was little of the journey left — Hogsmeade \\nStation had to be less than half an hour away, \\njudging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the \\nPage | 165 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwindows — but nobody else seemed prepared to take \\nHarry’s suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to \\nprove them. \\n\\n“I’ll see you two later,” said Harry under his breath, \\npulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over \\nhimself. \\n\\n“But what’re you — ?” asked Neville. \\n\\n“Later!” whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as \\nquietly as possible, though the rattling of the train \\nmade such caution almost pointless. \\n\\nThe corridors were almost completely empty now. \\nNearly everyone had returned to their carriages to \\nchange into their school robes and pack up their \\npossessions. Though he was as close as he could get \\nto Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick \\nenough to slip into the compartment when Zabini \\nopened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut \\nwhen Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it \\nclosing. \\n\\n“What’s wrong with this thing?” said Zabini angrily as \\nhe smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry’s \\nfoot. \\n\\nHarry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; \\nZabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over \\nsideways into Gregory Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing \\nruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt \\nonto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted \\nhimself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that \\nGoyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing \\nall eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet \\nand ankles had been revealed as the cloak had \\nflapped around them; indeed, for one horrible \\nmoment he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his \\nPage | 166 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then \\nGoyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off \\nhim; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking \\nruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and \\nMalfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats \\nwith his head in Pansy Parkinson’s lap. Harry lay \\ncurled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that \\nevery inch of him remained hidden, and watched \\nPansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy’s \\nforehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone \\nwould have loved to have been in her place. The \\nlanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a \\nbright light over the scene: Harry could read every \\nword of Crabbe’s comic directly below him. \\n\\n“So, Zabini,” said Malfoy, “what did Slughorn want?” \\n\\n“Just trying to make up to well-connected people,” \\nsaid Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle. “Not \\nthat he managed to find many.” \\n\\nThis information did not seem to please Malfoy. \\n\\n“Who else had he invited?” he demanded. \\n\\n“McLaggen from Gryffindor,” said Zabini. \\n\\n“Oh yeah, his uncle’s big in the Ministry,” said \\nMalfoy. \\n\\n“ — someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw — ” \\n\\n“Not him, he’s a prat!” said Pansy. \\n\\n“ — and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,” \\nfinished Zabini. \\n\\nMalfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy’s hand \\naside. \\n\\nPage | 167 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“He invited Longbottom?” \\n\\n“Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,” said \\nZabini indifferently. \\n\\n“What’s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?” \\n\\nZabini shrugged. \\n\\n“Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at \\n‘the Chosen One,’ ” sneered Malfoy, “but that Weasley \\ngirl! What’s so special about her?” \\n\\n“A lot of boys like her,” said Pansy, watching Malfoy \\nout of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. “Even \\nyou think she’s good-looking, don’t you, Blaise, and \\nwe all know how hard you are to please!” \\n\\n“I wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her \\nwhatever she looked like,” said Zabini coldly, and \\nPansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her \\nlap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his \\nhair. \\n\\n“Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste. Maybe he’s going a bit \\nsenile. Shame, my father always said he was a good \\nwizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a \\nfavorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn’t heard I’m on \\nthe train, or — ” \\n\\n“I wouldn’t bank on an invitation,” said Zabini. “He \\nasked me about Nott’s father when I first arrived. \\n\\nThey used to be old friends, apparently, but when he \\nheard he’d been caught at the Ministry he didn’t look \\nhappy, and Nott didn’t get an invitation, did he? I \\ndon’t think Slughorn’s interested in Death Eaters.” \\n\\nMalfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly \\nhumorless laugh. \\n\\nPage | 168 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, who cares what he’s interested in? What is he, \\nwhen you come down to it? Just some stupid \\nteacher.” Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. “I mean, I \\nmight not even be at Hogwarts next year, what’s it \\nmatter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or \\nnot?” \\n\\n“What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts \\nnext year?” said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming \\nMalfoy at once. \\n\\n“Well, you never know,” said Malfoy with the ghost of \\na smirk. “I might have — er — moved on to bigger and \\nbetter things.” \\n\\nCrouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry’s \\nheart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione \\nsay about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at \\nMalfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any \\nplans to move on to bigger and better things. Even \\nZabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his \\nhaughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of \\nMalfoy’s hair, looking dumbfounded. \\n\\n“Do you mean — Him?” \\n\\nMalfoy shrugged. \\n\\n“Mother wants me to complete my education, but \\npersonally, I don’t see it as that important these days. \\nI mean, think about it. ... When the Dark Lord takes \\nover, is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or \\nN.E.W.T.s anyone’s got? Of course he isn’t. ... It’ll be \\nall about the kind of service he received, the level of \\ndevotion he was shown.” \\n\\n“And you think you’ll be able to do something for \\nhim?” asked Zabini scathingly. “Sixteen years old and \\nnot even fully qualified yet?” \\n\\nPage | 169 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve just said, haven’t I? Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m \\nqualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t \\nsomething that you need to be qualified for,” said \\nMalfoy quietly. \\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths \\nopen like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy \\nas though she had never seen anything so awe- \\ninspiring. \\n\\n“I can see Hogwarts,” said Malfoy, clearly relishing the \\neffect he had created as he pointed out of the \\nblackened window. “We’d better get our robes on.” \\n\\nHarry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice \\nGoyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, \\nit hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an \\ninvoluntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the \\nluggage rack, frowning. \\n\\nHarry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not \\nmuch like the idea of being discovered hiding under \\nhis Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly \\nSlytherins. Eyes still watering and head still \\nthrobbing, he drew his wand, careful not to \\ndisarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his \\nrelief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined \\nthe noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, \\nlocked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky \\ncrawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his \\nneck. \\n\\nHarry could see the corridors filling up again and \\nhoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things \\nout onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he \\nwas until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, \\nwith a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. \\nGoyle threw the door open and muscled his way out \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 170 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninto a crowd of second years, punching them aside; \\nCrabbe and Zabini followed. \\n\\n“You go on,” Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for \\nhim with her hand held out as though hoping he \\nwould hold it. “I just want to check something.” \\n\\nPansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the \\ncompartment. People were filing past, descending \\nonto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the \\ncompartment door and let down the blinds, so that \\npeople in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He \\nthen bent down over his trunk and opened it again. \\n\\nHarry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, \\nhis heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy \\nwanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the \\nmysterious broken object it was so important to \\nmend? \\n\\n“Petrificus Totalusl” \\n\\nWithout warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, \\nwho was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow \\nmotion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, \\nwith an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy’s \\nfeet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his \\nwhole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly \\ninto the cramped kneeling position. He couldn’t move \\na muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who \\nsmiled broadly. \\n\\n“I thought so,” he said jubilantly. “I heard Goyle’s \\ntrunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white \\nflash through the air after Zabini came back. ...” \\n\\nHis eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry’s trainers. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 171 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You didn’t hear anything I care about, Potter. But \\nwhile I’ve got you here ...” \\n\\nAnd he stamped, hard, on Harry’s face. Harry felt his \\nnose break; blood spurted everywhere. \\n\\n“That’s from my father. Now, let’s see. ...” \\n\\nMalfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry’s \\nimmobilized body and threw it over him. \\n\\n“I don’t reckon they’ll find you till the train’s back in \\nLondon,” he said quietly. “See you around, Potter ... \\nor not.” \\n\\nAnd taking care to tread on Harry’s fingers, Malfoy \\nleft the compartment. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 172 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSNAPE VICTORIOUS \\n\\nHarry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath \\nthe Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose \\nflow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices \\nand footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate \\nthought was that someone, surely, would check the \\ncompartments before the train departed again. But at \\nonce came the dispiriting realization that even if \\nsomebody looked into the compartment, he would be \\nneither seen nor heard. His best hope was that \\nsomebody else would walk in and step on him. \\n\\nHarry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay \\nthere, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood \\ndripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a \\nstupid situation to have landed himself in . . . and now \\nthe last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was \\nshuffling along the dark platform outside; he could \\nhear the scraping of trunks and the loud babble of \\ntalk. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 173 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nRon and Hermione would think that he had left the \\ntrain without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts \\nand took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and \\ndown the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally \\nrealized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be \\nhalfway back to London. \\n\\nHe tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was \\nimpossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, \\nlike Dumbledore, could perform spells without \\nspeaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had \\nfallen out of his hand, by saying the words “Accio \\nWand\\\\” over and over again in his head, but nothing \\nhappened. \\n\\nHe thought he could hear the rustling of the trees \\nthat surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an \\nowl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he \\ndespised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked \\nvoices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A \\nfeeling of hopelessness spread through him as he \\nimagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages \\ntrundling up to the school and the muffled yells of \\nlaughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was \\nriding in, where he could be recounting his attack on \\nHarry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson. \\n\\nThe train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his \\nside. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of \\nthe seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to \\nvibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was \\nleaving and nobody knew he was still on it. ... \\n\\nThen he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a \\nvoice overhead said, “Wotcher, Harry.” \\n\\nThere was a flash of red light and Harry’s body \\nunfroze; he was able to push himself into a more \\ndignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his \\n\\nPage | 174 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbruised face with the back of his hand, and raise his \\nhead to look up at Tonks, who was holding the \\nInvisibility Cloak she had just pulled away. \\n\\n“We’d better get out of here, quickly,” she said, as the \\ntrain windows became obscured with steam and they \\nbegan to move out of the station. “Come on, we’ll \\njump.” \\n\\nHarry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled \\nopen the train door and leapt onto the platform, \\nwhich seemed to be sliding underneath them as the \\ntrain gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered \\na little on landing, then straightened up in time to see \\nthe gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, \\nround the corner, and disappear from view. \\n\\nThe cold night air was soothing on his throbbing \\nnose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and \\nembarrassed that he had been discovered in such a \\nridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the \\nInvisibility Cloak. \\n\\n“Who did it?” \\n\\n“Draco Malfoy,” said Harry bitterly. “Thanks for ... \\nwell ...” \\n\\n“No problem,” said Tonks, without smiling. From \\nwhat Harry could see in the darkness, she was as \\nmousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been \\nwhen he had met her at the Burrow. “I can fix your \\nnose if you stand still.” \\n\\nHarry did not think much of this idea; he had been \\nintending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in \\nwhom he had a little more confidence when it came to \\nHealing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he \\nstayed stock-still and closed his eyes. \\n\\nPage | 175 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Episkey,” said Tonks. \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry’s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He \\nraised a hand and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be \\nmended. \\n\\n“Thanks a lot!” \\n\\n“You’d better put that cloak back on, and we can walk \\nup to the school,” said Tonks, still unsmiling. As \\nHarry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved \\nher wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature \\nerupted from it and streaked off into the darkness. \\n\\n“Was that a Patronus?” asked Harry, who had seen \\nDumbledore send messages like this. \\n\\n“Yes, I’m sending word to the castle that I’ve got you \\nor they’ll worry. Come on, we’d better not dawdle.” \\n\\nThey set off toward the lane that led to the school. \\n\\n“How did you find me?” \\n\\n“I noticed you hadn’t left the train and I knew you \\nhad that cloak. I thought you might be hiding for \\nsome reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn \\ndown on that compartment I thought I’d check.” \\n\\n“But what are you doing here, anyway?” Harry asked. \\n\\n“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school \\nextra protection,” said Tonks. \\n\\n“Is it just you who’s stationed up here, or — ?” \\n\\n“No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.” \\n\\n“Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?” \\n\\nPage | 176 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s right.” \\n\\n\\n\\nThey trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the \\nfreshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways \\nat Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been \\ninquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at \\ntimes), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. \\nNow she seemed older and much more serious and \\npurposeful. Was this all the effect of what had \\nhappened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably \\nthat Hermione would have suggested he say \\nsomething consoling about Sirius to her, that it \\nhadn’t been her fault at all, but he couldn’t bring \\nhimself to do it. He was far from blaming her for \\nSirius’s death; it was no more her fault than anyone \\nelse’s (and much less than his), but he did not like \\ntalking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they \\ntramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks ’s \\nlong cloak whispering on the ground behind them. \\n\\nHaving always traveled there by carriage, Harry had \\nnever before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was \\nfrom Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally \\nsaw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each \\ntopped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was \\nhungry, and he was quite keen to leave this new, \\ngloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to \\npush open the gates, he found them chained shut. \\n\\n“Alohomora\\\\” he said confidently, pointing his wand at \\nthe padlock, but nothing happened. \\n\\n“That won’t work on these,” said Tonks. “Dumbledore \\nbewitched them himself.” \\n\\nHarry looked around. \\n\\n“I could climb a wall,” he suggested. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 177 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, you couldn’t,” said Tonks flatly. “Anti-intruder \\njinxes on all of them. Security’s been tightened a \\nhundredfold this summer.” \\n\\n“Well then,” said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her \\nlack of helpfulness, “I suppose I’ll just have to sleep \\nout here and wait for morning.” \\n\\n“Someone’s coming down for you,” said Tonks. “Look.” \\n\\nA lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the \\ncastle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could \\neven endure Filch’s wheezy criticisms of his tardiness \\nand rants about how his timekeeping would improve \\nwith the regular application of thumbscrews. It was \\nnot until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away \\nfrom them, and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility \\nCloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, \\nwith a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose \\nand long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape. \\n\\n“Well, well, well,” sneered Snape, taking out his wand \\nand tapping the padlock once, so that the chains \\nsnaked backward and the gates creaked open. “Nice \\nof you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently \\ndecided that the wearing of school robes would \\ndetract from your appearance.” \\n\\n“I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my — ” Harry began, \\nbut Snape cut across him. \\n\\n“There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite \\n— ah — safe in my hands.” \\n\\n“I meant Hagrid to get the message,” said Tonks, \\nfrowning. \\n\\n“Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like \\nPotter here, so I took it instead. And incidentally,” \\n\\nPage | 178 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsaid Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, \\n“I was interested to see your new Patronus.” \\n\\nHe shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and \\ntapped the chains with his wand again, so that they \\nslithered, clinking, back into place. \\n\\n“I think you were better off with the old one,” said \\nSnape, the malice in his voice unmistakable. “The \\nnew one looks weak.” \\n\\nAs Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, \\nfleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks’s face. \\nThen she was covered in darkness once more. \\n\\n“Good night,” Harry called to her over his shoulder, as \\nhe began the walk up to the school with Snape. \\n“Thanks for ... everything.” \\n\\n“See you, Harry.” \\n\\nSnape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as \\nthough his body was generating waves of hatred so \\npowerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could \\nnot feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape \\nfrom their first encounter, but Snape had placed \\nhimself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility \\nof Harry’s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. \\nWhatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to \\nthink over the summer, and had concluded that \\nSnape ’s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining \\nsafely hidden while the rest of the Order of the \\nPhoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably \\nbeen a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the \\nMinistry the night that he had died. Harry clung to \\nthis notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, \\nwhich felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if \\nanyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the \\nman now striding next to him in the darkness. \\n\\nPage | 179 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,” \\nsaid Snape. “And, let me see, another twenty for your \\nMuggle attire. You know, I don’t believe any House \\nhas ever been in negative figures this early in the \\nterm: We haven’t even started pudding. You might \\nhave set a record, Potter.” \\n\\nThe fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to \\nblaze white-hot, but he would rather have been \\nimmobilized all the way back to London than tell \\nSnape why he was late. \\n\\n“I suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did \\nyou?” Snape continued. “And with no flying car \\navailable you decided that bursting into the Great \\nHall halfway through the feast ought to create a \\ndramatic effect.” \\n\\nStill Harry remained silent, though he thought his \\nchest might explode. He knew that Snape had come \\nto fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he \\ncould needle and torment Harry without anyone else \\nlistening. \\n\\nThey reached the castle steps at last and as the great \\noaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged \\nentrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of \\ntinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the \\ndoors standing open into the Great Hall. Harry \\nwondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak \\nback on, thereby gaining his seat at the long \\nGryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the \\nfarthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. \\nAs though he had read Harry’s mind, however, Snape \\nsaid, “No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees \\nyou, which is what you wanted, I’m sure.” \\n\\nHarry turned on the spot and marched straight \\nthrough the open doors: anything to get away from \\n\\nPage | 180 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnape. The Great Hall, with its four long House tables \\nand its staff table set at the top of the room, was \\ndecorated as usual with floating candles that made \\nthe plates below glitter and glow. It was all a \\nshimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so \\nfast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before \\npeople really started to stare, and by the time they \\nwere standing up to get a good look at him, he had \\nspotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches \\ntoward them, and forced his way in between them. \\n\\n“Where’ve you — blimey, what’ve you done to your \\nface?” said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone \\nelse in the vicinity. \\n\\n“Why, what’s wrong with it?” said Harry, grabbing a \\nspoon and squinting at his distorted reflection. \\n\\n“You’re covered in blood!” said Hermione. “Come here \\n\\n\\n\\nShe raised her wand, said “Tergeol” and siphoned off \\nthe dried blood. \\n\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, feeling his now clean face. \\n“How’s my nose looking?” \\n\\n“Normal,” said Hermione anxiously. “Why shouldn’t \\nit? Harry, what happened? We’ve been terrified!” \\n\\n“I’ll tell you later,” said Harry curtly. He was very \\nconscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus \\nwere listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the \\nGryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench \\nto eavesdrop. \\n\\n“But — ” said Hermione. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 181 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not now, Hermione,” said Harry, in a darkly \\nsignificant voice. He hoped very much that they would \\nall assume he had been involved in something heroic, \\npreferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a \\ndementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story \\nas far and wide as he could, but there was always a \\nchance it wouldn’t reach too many Gryffindor ears. \\n\\nHe reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs \\nand a handful of chips, but before he could take them \\nthey vanished, to be replaced with puddings. \\n\\n“You missed the Sorting, anyway,” said Hermione, as \\nRon dived for a large chocolate gateau. \\n\\n“Hat say anything interesting?” asked Harry, taking a \\npiece of treacle tart. \\n\\n“More of the same, really ... advising us all to unite in \\nthe face of our enemies, you know.” \\n\\n“Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?” \\n\\n“Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for \\nafter the feast, doesn’t he? It can’t be long now.” \\n\\n“Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast — ” \\n\\n“You’ve seen Snape? How come?” said Ron between \\nfrenzied mouthfuls of gateau. \\n\\n“Bumped into him,” said Harry evasively. \\n\\n“Hagrid was only a few minutes late,” said Hermione. \\n“Look, he’s waving at you, Harry.” \\n\\nHarry looked up at the staff table and grinned at \\nHagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had \\nnever quite managed to comport himself with the \\n\\nPage | 182 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor \\nHouse, the top of whose head came up to somewhere \\nbetween Hagrid’s elbow and shoulder as they were \\nsitting side by side, and who was looking \\ndisapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry \\nwas surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor \\nTrelawney, sitting on Hagrid’s other side; she rarely \\nleft her tower room, and he had never seen her at the \\nstart-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, \\nglittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes \\nmagnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having \\nalways considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had \\nbeen shocked to discover at the end of the previous \\nterm that it had been she who had made the \\nprediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry’s \\nparents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge had \\nmade him even less eager to find himself in her \\ncompany, but thankfully, this year he would be \\ndropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes \\nswiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away \\ntoward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming \\nthe shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and \\napplause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, \\nhis insides burning again. What he would not give to \\nfight Malfoy one-on-one . . . \\n\\n“So what did Professor Slughorn want?” Hermione \\nasked. \\n\\n“To know what really happened at the Ministry,” said \\nHarry. \\n\\n“Him and everyone else here,” sniffed Hermione. \\n“People were interrogating us about it on the train, \\nweren’t they, Ron?” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron. “All wanting to know if you really \\nare ‘the Chosen One’ — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 183 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“There has been much talk on that very subject even \\namongst the ghosts,” interrupted Nearly Headless \\nNick, inclining his barely connected head toward \\nHarry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. “I am \\nconsidered something of a Potter authority; it is \\nwidely known that we are friendly. I have assured the \\nspirit community that I will not pester you for \\ninformation, however. ‘Harry Potter knows that he \\ncan confide in me with complete confidence/ I told \\nthem. ‘I would rather die than betray his trust.’ ” \\n\\n“That’s not saying much, seeing as you’re already \\ndead,” Ron observed. \\n\\n“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt \\naxe,” said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, \\nand he rose into the air and glided back toward the \\nfar end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got \\nto his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter \\nechoing around the Hall died away almost instantly. \\n\\n“The very best of evenings to you!” he said, smiling \\nbroadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace \\nthe whole room. \\n\\n“What happened to his hand?” gasped Hermione. \\n\\nShe was not the only one who had noticed. \\nDumbledore ’s right hand was as blackened and dead- \\nlooking as it had been on the night he had come to \\nfetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers swept the \\nroom; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, \\nmerely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve \\nover his injury. \\n\\n“Nothing to worry about,” he said airily. “Now ... to \\nour new students, welcome, to our old students, \\nwelcome back! Another year full of magical education \\nawaits you ...” \\n\\nPage | 184 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“His hand was like that when I saw him over the \\nsummer,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I thought \\nhe’d have cured it by now, though ... or Madam \\nPomfrey would’ve done.” \\n\\n“It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a \\nnauseated expression. “But there are some injuries \\nyou can’t cure ... old curses ... and there are poisons \\nwithout antidotes. ...” \\n\\n\"... and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say \\nthat there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought \\nat the shop called Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. \\n\\n“Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch \\nteams should give their names to their Heads of \\nHouse as usual. We are also looking for new \\nQuidditch commentators, who should do likewise. \\n\\n“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff \\nthis year. Professor Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, \\nhis bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big \\nwaistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow \\n— “is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to \\nresume his old post of Potions master.” \\n\\n“Potions?” \\n\\n“Potions?” \\n\\nThe word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered \\nwhether they had heard right. \\n\\n“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning \\nto stare at Harry. “But you said — ” \\n\\n“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, \\nraising his voice so that it carried over all the \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 185 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmuttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense \\nAgainst the Dark Arts teacher.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in \\nhis direction. He did not care; he was staring up at \\nthe staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given \\nthe Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this \\ntime? Hadn’t it been widely known for years that \\nDumbledore did not trust him to do it? \\n\\n“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be \\nteaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!” said \\nHermione. \\n\\n“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to \\nremember when Dumbledore had told him this, but \\nnow that he came to think of it, he was unable to \\nrecall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn \\nwould be teaching. \\n\\nSnape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did \\nnot stand up at the mention of his name; he merely \\nraised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause \\nfrom the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could \\ndetect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so \\nmuch. \\n\\n“Well, there’s one good thing,” he said savagely. \\n\\n“Snape ’ll be gone by the end of the year.” \\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked Ron. \\n\\n“That job’s jinxed. No one’s lasted more than a year. \\n\\n... Quirrell actually died doing it. ... Personally, I’m \\ngoing to keep my fingers crossed for another death. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Harry!” said Hermione, shocked and reproachful. \\n\\nPage | 186 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end \\nof the year,” said Ron reasonably. “That Slughorn \\nbloke might not want to stay long-term. Moody \\ndidn’t.” \\n\\nDumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione were not the only ones who had been \\ntalking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of \\nconversation at the news that Snape had finally \\nachieved his heart’s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the \\nsensational nature of the news he had just imparted, \\nDumbledore said nothing more about staff \\nappointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure \\nthat the silence was absolute before continuing. \\n\\n“Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord \\nVoldemort and his followers are once more at large \\nand gaining in strength.” \\n\\nThe silence seemed to tauten and strain as \\nDumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy \\nwas not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork \\nhover in midair with his wand, as though he found \\nthe headmaster’s words unworthy of his attention. \\n\\n“I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous \\nthe present situation is, and how much care each of \\nus at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain \\nsafe. The castle’s magical fortifications have been \\nstrengthened over the summer, we are protected in \\nnew and more powerful ways, but we must still guard \\nscrupulously against carelessness on the part of any \\nstudent or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to \\nabide by any security restrictions that your teachers \\nmight impose upon you, however irksome you might \\nfind them — in particular, the rule that you are not to \\nbe out of bed after hours. I implore you, should you \\nnotice anything strange or suspicious within or \\noutside the castle, to report it to a member of staff \\nPage | 187 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nimmediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, \\nalways, with the utmost regard for your own and \\nothers’ safety.” \\n\\nDumbledore’s blue eyes swept over the students \\nbefore he smiled once more. \\n\\n“But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable \\nas you could possibly wish, and I know that your top \\npriority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. \\nLet us therefore say good night. Pip pip!” \\n\\nWith the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches \\nwere moved back and the hundreds of students began \\nto file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories. \\nHarry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the \\ngawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to \\nallow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, \\nlagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his \\ntrainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw \\nahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill \\nher prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years, but \\nRon remained with Harry. \\n\\n“What really happened to your nose?” he asked, once \\nthey were at the very back of the throng pressing out \\nof the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else. \\n\\nHarry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their \\nfriendship that Ron did not laugh. \\n\\n“I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,” \\nhe said darkly. \\n\\n“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry bitterly. \\n“Listen to what he was saying before he found out I \\nwas there. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 188 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoy’s \\nboasts. With what Harry considered pure \\npigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed. \\n\\n“Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for \\nParkinson. ... What kind of mission would You-Know- \\nWho have given him?” \\n\\n“How d’you know Voldemort doesn’t need someone at \\nHogwarts? It wouldn’t be the first — ” \\n\\n“I wish yeh’d stop sayin’ tha’ name, Harry,” said a \\nreproachful voice behind them. Harry looked over his \\nshoulder to see Hagrid shaking his head. \\n\\n“Dumbledore uses that name,” said Harry stubbornly. \\n\\n“Yeah, well, tha’s Dumbledore, innit?” said Hagrid \\nmysteriously. “So how come yeh were late, Harry? I \\nwas worried.” \\n\\n“Got held up on the train,” said Harry. “Why were you \\nlate?” \\n\\n“I was with Grawp,” said Hagrid happily. “Los’ track o’ \\nthe time. He’s got a new home up in the mountains \\nnow, Dumbledore fixed it — nice big cave. He’s much \\nhappier than he was in the forest. We were havin’ a \\ngood chat.” \\n\\n“Really?” said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron’s \\neye; the last time he had met Hagrid’s half-brother, a \\nvicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the \\nroots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of \\nwhich he was unable to pronounce properly. \\n\\n“Oh yeah, he’s really come on,” said Hagrid proudly. \\n“Yeh’ll be amazed. I’m thinkin’ o’ trainin’ him up as \\nme assistant.” \\n\\nPage | 189 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a \\nviolent sneeze. They were now standing beside the \\noak front doors. \\n\\n“Anyway, I’ll see yeh tomorrow, firs’ lesson’s straight \\nafter lunch. Come early an’ yeh can say hello ter Buck \\n— I mean, Witherwings!” \\n\\nRaising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of \\nthe front doors into the darkness. \\n\\nHarry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell \\nthat Ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as \\nhimself. \\n\\n“You’re not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are \\nyou?” \\n\\nRon shook his head. “And you’re not either, are you?” \\n\\nHarry shook his head too. \\n\\n“And Hermione,” said Ron, “she’s not, is she?” \\n\\nHarry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid \\nwould say when he realized his three favorite \\nstudents had given up his subject, he did not like to \\nthink. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 190 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE \\n\\nHarry and Ron met Hermione in the common room \\nbefore breakfast next morning. Hoping for some \\nsupport for his theory, Harry lost no time in telling \\nHermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on \\nthe Hogwarts Express. \\n\\n“But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, \\nwasn’t he?” interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione \\ncould say anything. \\n\\n“Well,” she said uncertainly, “I don’t know. ... It would \\nbe like Malfoy to make himself seem more important \\nthan he is ... but that’s a big lie to tell. ...” \\n\\n“Exactly,” said Harry, but he could not press the \\npoint, because so many people were trying to listen in \\nto his conversation, not to mention staring at him and \\nwhispering behind their hands. \\n\\n“It’s rude to point,” Ron snapped at a particularly \\nminuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to \\nclimb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been \\n\\nPage | 191 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nmuttering something about Harry behind his hand to \\nhis friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of \\nthe hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. \\n\\n“I love being a sixth year. And we’re going to be \\ngetting free time this year. Whole periods when we \\ncan just sit up here and relax.” \\n\\n“We’re going to need that time for studying, Ron!” said \\nHermione, as they set off down the corridor. \\n\\n“Yeah, but not today,” said Ron. “Today’s going to be \\na real doss, I reckon.” \\n\\n“Hold it!” said Hermione, throwing out an arm and \\nhalting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to \\npush past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly \\nin his hand. “Fanged Frisbees are banned, hand it \\nover,” she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed \\nover the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and \\ntook off after his friends. Ron waited for him to \\nvanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione ’s grip. \\n\\n“Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these.” \\n\\nHermione ’s remonstration was drowned by a loud \\ngiggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron’s \\nremark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as \\nshe passed them, glancing back at Ron over her \\nshoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself. \\n\\nThe ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and \\nstreaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares \\nof sky visible through the high mullioned windows. \\nWhile they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, \\nHarry and Ron told Hermione about their \\nembarrassing conversation with Hagrid the previous \\nevening. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 192 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But he can’t really think we’d continue Care of \\nMagical Creatures!” she said, looking distressed. “I \\nmean, when has any of us expressed ... you know ... \\nany enthusiasm?” \\n\\n“That’s it, though, innit?” said Ron, swallowing an \\nentire fried egg whole. “We were the ones who made \\nthe most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But \\nhe thinks we liked the stupid subject D’you reckon \\nanyone’s going to go on to N.E.W.T.?” \\n\\nNeither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no \\nneed. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their \\nyear would want to continue Care of Magical \\nCreatures. They avoided Hagrid’s eye and returned \\nhis cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the \\nstaff table ten minutes later. \\n\\nAfter they had eaten, they remained in their places, \\nawaiting Professor McGonagall’s descent from the \\nstaff table. The distribution of class schedules was \\nmore complicated than usual this year, for Professor \\nMcGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody \\nhad achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue \\nwith their chosen N.E.W.T.s. \\n\\nHermione was immediately cleared to continue with \\nCharms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, \\nTransfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient \\nRunes, and Potions, and shot off to a first-period \\nAncient Runes class without further ado. Neville took \\na little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious \\nas Professor McGonagall looked down his application \\nand then consulted his O.W.L. results. \\n\\n“Herbology, fine,” she said. “Professor Sprout will be \\ndelighted to see you back with an ‘Outstanding’ \\n\\nO.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark \\nArts with ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ But the problem is \\n\\nPage | 193 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTransfiguration. I’m sorry, Longbottom, but an \\nAcceptable’ really isn’t good enough to continue to \\nN.E.W.T level. I just don’t think you’d be able to cope \\nwith the coursework.” \\n\\nNeville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered \\nat him through her square spectacles. \\n\\n“Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, \\nanyway? I’ve never had the impression that you \\nparticularly enjoyed it.” \\n\\nNeville looked miserable and muttered something \\nabout “my grandmother wants.” \\n\\n“Hmph,” snorted Professor McGonagall. “It’s high time \\nyour grandmother learned to be proud of the \\ngrandson she’s got, rather than the one she thinks \\nshe ought to have — particularly after what happened \\nat the Ministry.” \\n\\nNeville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; \\nProfessor McGonagall had never paid him a \\ncompliment before. \\n\\n“I’m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my \\nN.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an ‘Exceeds \\nExpectations’ in Charms, however — why not try for a \\nN.E.W.T. in Charms?” \\n\\n“My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,” \\nmumbled Neville. \\n\\n“Take Charms,” said Professor McGonagall, “and I \\nshall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just \\nbecause she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is \\nnot necessarily worthless.” Smiling slightly at the look \\nof delighted incredulity on Neville’s face, Professor \\nMcGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of \\nPage | 194 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nher wand and handed it, now carrying details of his \\nnew classes, to Neville. \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, \\nwhose first question was whether Firenze, the \\nhandsome centaur, was still teaching Divination. \\n\\n“He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes \\nbetween them this year,” said Professor McGonagall, \\na hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common \\nknowledge that she despised the subject of \\nDivination. “The sixth year is being taken by Professor \\nTrelawney.” \\n\\nParvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking \\nslightly crestfallen. \\n\\n“So, Potter, Potter ...” said Professor McGonagall, \\nconsulting her notes as she turned to Harry. \\n\\n“Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, \\nTransfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased \\nwith your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. \\nNow, why haven’t you applied to continue with \\nPotions? I thought it was your ambition to become an \\nAuror?” \\n\\n“It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ \\nin my O.W.L., Professor.” \\n\\n“And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching \\nthe subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly \\nhappy to accept N.E.W.T students with ‘Exceeds \\nExpectations’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with \\nPotions?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I didn’t buy the books or any \\ningredients or anything — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 195 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you \\nsome,” said Professor McGonagall. “Very well, Potter, \\nhere is your schedule. Oh, by the way — twenty \\nhopefuls have already put down their names for the \\nGryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you \\nin due course and you can fix up trials at your \\nleisure.” \\n\\nA few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same \\nsubjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table \\ntogether. \\n\\n“Look,” said Ron delightedly, gazing at his schedule, \\n“we’ve got a free period now ... and a free period after \\nbreak ... and after lunch ... excellent.” \\n\\nThey returned to the common room, which was empty \\napart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie \\nBell, the only remaining member of the original \\nGryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in \\nhis first year. \\n\\n“I thought you’d get that, well done,” she called over, \\npointing at the Captain’s badge on Harry’s chest. “Tell \\nme when you call trials!” \\n\\n“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, “you don’t need to try \\nout, I’ve watched you play for five years. ...” \\n\\n“You mustn’t start off like that,” she said warningly. \\n“For all you know, there’s someone much better than \\nme out there. Good teams have been ruined before \\nnow because Captains just kept playing the old faces, \\nor letting in their friends. ...” \\n\\nRon looked a little uncomfortable and began playing \\nwith the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the \\nfourth-year student. It zoomed around the common \\nroom, snarling and attempting to take bites of the \\n\\nPage | 196 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntapestry. Crookshanks’s yellow eyes followed it and he \\nhissed when it came too close. \\n\\nAn hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common \\nroom for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom \\nfour floors below. Hermione was already queuing \\noutside, carrying an armful of heavy books and \\nlooking put-upon. \\n\\n“We got so much homework for Runes,” she said \\nanxiously, when Harry and Ron joined her. “A fifteen- \\ninch essay, two translations, and I’ve got to read \\nthese by Wednesday!” \\n\\n“Shame,” yawned Ron. \\n\\n“You wait,” she said resentfully. “I bet Snape gives us \\nloads.” \\n\\nThe classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape \\nstepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as \\never by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell \\nover the queue immediately. \\n\\n“Inside,” he said. \\n\\nHarry looked around as they entered. Snape had \\nimposed his personality upon the room already; it \\nwas gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn \\nover the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New \\npictures adorned the walls, many of them showing \\npeople who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly \\ninjuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody \\nspoke as they settled down, looking around at the \\nshadowy, gruesome pictures. \\n\\n“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said \\nSnape, closing the door and moving to face the class \\nfrom behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her \\n\\nPage | 197 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncopy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag \\nand stowed it under her chair. “I wish to speak to \\nyou, and I want your fullest attention.” \\n\\nHis black eyes roved over their upturned faces, \\nlingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry’s \\nthan anyone else’s. \\n\\n“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I \\nbelieve.” \\n\\nYou believe ... like you haven’t watched them all come \\nand go, Snape, hoping you’d be next, thought Harry \\nscathingly. \\n\\n“Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own \\nmethods and priorities. Given this confusion I am \\nsurprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this \\nsubject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you \\nmanage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will \\nbe much more advanced.” \\n\\nSnape set off around the edge of the room, speaking \\nnow in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to \\nkeep him in view. \\n\\n“The Dark Arts,” said Snape, “are many, varied, ever- \\nchanging, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a \\nmany-headed monster, which, each time a neck is \\nsevered, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than \\nbefore. You are fighting that which is unfixed, \\nmutating, indestructible.” \\n\\nHarry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to \\nrespect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another \\nto speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving \\ncaress in his voice? \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 198 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must \\ntherefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you \\nseek to undo. These pictures” — he indicated a few of \\nthem as he swept past — “give a fair representation of \\nwhat happens to those who suffer, for instance, the \\nCruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand toward a witch \\nwho was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the \\nDementor’s Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and \\nblank-eyed, slumped against a wall — “or provoke the \\naggression of the Inferius” — a bloody mass upon the \\nground. \\n\\n“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil \\nin a high-pitched voice. “Is it definite, is he using \\nthem?” \\n\\n“The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said \\nSnape, “which means you would be well-advised to \\nassume he might use them again. Now ...” \\n\\nHe set off again around the other side of the \\nclassroom toward his desk, and again, they watched \\nhim as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind \\nhim. \\n\\n\"... you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of \\nnonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a \\nnonverbal spell?” \\n\\nHermione’s hand shot into the air. Snape took his \\ntime looking around at everybody else, making sure \\nhe had no choice, before saying curtly, “Very well — \\nMiss Granger?” \\n\\n“Your adversary has no warning about what kind of \\nmagic you’re about to perform,” said Hermione, \\n\\n“which gives you a split-second advantage.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 199 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“An answer copied almost word for word from The \\nStandard Book of Spells, Grade Six,” said Snape \\ndismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), \\n“but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress to \\nusing magic without shouting incantations gain an \\nelement of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all \\nwizards can do this, of course; it is a question of \\nconcentration and mind power which some” — his \\ngaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more — \\n“lack.” \\n\\nHarry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous \\nOcclumency lessons of the previous year. He refused \\nto drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape \\nlooked away. \\n\\n“You will now divide,” Snape went on, “into pairs. One \\npartner will attempt to jinx the other without \\nspeaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in \\nequal silence. Carry on.” \\n\\nAlthough Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at \\nleast half the class (everyone who had been a member \\nof the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the \\nprevious year. None of them had ever cast the charm \\nwithout speaking, however. A reasonable amount of \\ncheating ensued; many people were merely \\nwhispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. \\nTypically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione \\nmanaged to repel Neville’s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx \\nwithout uttering a single word, a feat that would \\nsurely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor \\nfrom any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, \\nbut which Snape ignored. He swept between them as \\nthey practiced, looking just as much like an \\novergrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and \\nRon struggling with the task. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 200 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was \\npurple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save \\nhimself from the temptation of muttering the \\nincantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on \\ntenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever \\nto come. \\n\\n“Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. “Here \\n— let me show you — ” \\n\\nHe turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry \\nreacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells \\nforgotten, he yelled, “Protegol” \\n\\nHis Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked \\noff-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had \\nlooked around and now watched as Snape righted \\nhimself, scowling. \\n\\n“Do you remember me telling you we are practicing \\nnonverbal spells, Potter?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry stiffly. \\n\\n“Yes, sir.” \\n\\n“There’s no need to call me ‘sir,’ Professor.” \\n\\nThe words had escaped him before he knew what he \\nwas saying. Several people gasped, including \\nHermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and \\nSeamus grinned appreciatively. \\n\\n“Detention, Saturday night, my office,” said Snape. “I \\ndo not take cheek from anyone, Potter ... not even ‘the \\nChosen One. ’ ” \\n\\n“That was brilliant, Harry!” chortled Ron, once they \\nwere safely on their way to break a short while later. \\n\\nPage | 201 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said Hermione, \\nfrowning at Ron. “What made you?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice!” fumed \\nHarry. “I had enough of that during those \\nOcclumency lessons! Why doesn’t he use another \\nguinea pig for a change? What’s Dumbledore playing \\nat, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear \\nhim talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All \\nthat unfixed, indestructible stuff — ” \\n\\n“Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sounded a bit \\nlike you.” \\n\\n“Like me?” \\n\\n“Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face \\nVoldemort. You said it wasn’t just memorizing a \\nbunch of spells, you said it was just you and your \\nbrains and your guts — well, wasn’t that what Snape \\nwas saying? That it really comes down to being brave \\nand quick-thinking?” \\n\\nHarry was so disarmed that she had thought his \\nwords as well worth memorizing as The Standard \\nBook of Spells that he did not argue. \\n\\n“Harry! Hey, Harry!” \\n\\nHarry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters \\non last year’s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was \\nhurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment. \\n\\n“For you,” panted Sloper. “Listen, I heard you’re the \\nnew Captain. When’re you holding trials?” \\n\\n“I’m not sure yet,” said Harry, thinking privately that \\nSloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. \\n“I’ll let you know.” \\n\\nPage | 202 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, right. I was hoping it’d be this weekend — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nBut Harry was not listening; he had just recognized \\nthe thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving \\nSloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron \\nand Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went. \\n\\nDear Harry, \\n\\nI would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. \\nKindly come along to my office at 8 p.m. I hope you are \\nenjoying your first day back at school. \\n\\nYours sincerely, \\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore \\n\\nP. S. I enjoy Acid Pops. \\n\\n“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said Ron, who had read the \\nmessage over Harry’s shoulder and was looking \\nperplexed. \\n\\n“It’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his \\nstudy,” said Harry in a low voice. “Ha! Snape’s not \\ngoing to be pleased. ... I won’t be able to do his \\ndetention!” \\n\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break \\nspeculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. \\nRon thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes \\nand hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not \\nknow. Hermione said such things were illegal, and \\nthought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted \\nto teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After \\nbreak, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and \\nRon returned to the common room, where they \\ngrudgingly started Snape’s homework. This turned \\nout to be so complex that they still had not finished \\nPage | 203 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free \\nperiod (though she considerably speeded up the \\nprocess). They had only just finished when the bell \\nrang for the afternoon’s double Potions and they beat \\nthe familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that \\nhad, for so long, been Snape’s. \\n\\nWhen they arrived in the corridor they saw that there \\nwere only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. \\nlevel. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve \\nthe required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had \\nmade it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws \\nwere there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, \\nwhom Harry liked despite his rather pompous \\nmanner. \\n\\n“Harry,” Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand \\nas Harry approached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in \\nDefense Against the Dark Arts this morning. Good \\nlesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of \\ncourse, for us old D.A. lags ... And how are you, Ron \\n— Hermione?” \\n\\nBefore they could say more than “fine,” the dungeon \\ndoor opened and Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of \\nthe door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus \\nmustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he \\ngreeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm. \\n\\nThe dungeon was, most unusually, already full of \\nvapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione \\nsniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling \\ncauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, \\nas did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the \\none nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting \\none of the most seductive scents Harry had ever \\ninhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of \\ntreacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, \\nPage | 204 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand something flowery he thought he might have \\nsmelled at the Burrow. He found that he was \\nbreathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion’s \\nfumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great \\ncontentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, \\nwho grinned back lazily. \\n\\n“Now then, now then, now then,” said Slughorn, \\nwhose massive outline was quivering through the \\nmany shimmering vapors. “Scales out, everyone, and \\npotion kits, and don’t forget your copies of Advanced \\nPotion-Making. ...” \\n\\n“Sir?” said Harry, raising his hand. \\n\\n“Harry, m’boy?” \\n\\n“I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s \\nRon — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the \\nN.E.W.T., you see — ” \\n\\n“Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention ... not to \\nworry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use \\ningredients from the store cupboard today, and I’m \\nsure we can lend you some scales, and we’ve got a \\nsmall stock of old books here, they’ll do until you can \\nwrite to Flourish and Blotts. ...” \\n\\nSlughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after \\na moment’s foraging, emerged with two very battered- \\nlooking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius \\nBorage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with \\ntwo sets of tarnished scales. \\n\\n“Now then,” said Slughorn, returning to the front of \\nthe class and inflating his already bulging chest so \\nthat the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst \\noff, “I’ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look \\nat, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind \\nPage | 205 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof thing you ought to be able to make after completing \\nyour N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of ’em, even \\nif you haven’t made ’em yet. Anyone tell me what this \\none is?” \\n\\nHe indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. \\nHarry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what \\nlooked like plain water boiling away inside it. \\n\\nHermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before \\nanybody else’s; Slughorn pointed at her. \\n\\n“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that \\nforces the drinker to tell the truth,” said Hermione. \\n\\n“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” \\nhe continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the \\nRavenclaw table, “this one here is pretty well known. \\n... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too ... Who \\ncan — ?” \\n\\nHermione’s hand was fastest once more. \\n\\n“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said. \\n\\nHarry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike \\nsubstance in the second cauldron, but did not resent \\nHermione getting the credit for answering the \\nquestion; she, after all, was the one who had \\nsucceeded in making it, back in their second year. \\n\\n“Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here ... yes, my \\ndear?” said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, \\nas Hermione’s hand punched the air again. \\n\\n“It’s Amortentia!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 206 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said \\nSlughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, “but I \\nassume you know what it does?” \\n\\n“It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said \\nHermione. \\n\\n“Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its \\ndistinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?” \\n\\n“And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said \\nHermione enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to \\nsmell differently to each of us, according to what \\nattracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and \\nnew parchment and — ” \\n\\nBut she turned slightly pink and did not complete the \\nsentence. \\n\\n“May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn, \\nignoring Hermione’s embarrassment. \\n\\n“Hermione Granger, sir.” \\n\\n“Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to \\nHector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most \\nExtraordinary Society of Potioneers?” \\n\\n“No, I don’t think so, sir. I’m Muggle-born, you see.” \\n\\nHarry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper \\nsomething; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn \\nshowed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and \\nlooked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next \\nto her. \\n\\n“Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and \\nshe’s the best in our yeah’ I’m assuming this is the \\nvery friend of whom you spoke, Harry?” \\n\\nPage | 207 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for \\nGryffindor, Miss Granger,” said Slughorn genially. \\n\\nMalfoy looked rather as he had done the time \\nHermione had punched him in the face. Hermione \\nturned to Harry with a radiant expression and \\nwhispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the \\nyear? Oh, Harry!” \\n\\n“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered \\nRon, who for some reason looked annoyed. “You are \\nthe best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if he’d asked \\nme!” \\n\\nHermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that \\nthey could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron \\nlooked slightly disgruntled. \\n\\n“Amortentia doesn’t really create love, of course. It is \\nimpossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this \\nwill simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. \\nIt is probably the most dangerous and powerful \\npotion in this room — oh yes,” he said, nodding \\ngravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were \\nsmirking skeptically. “When you have seen as much \\nof life as I have, you will not underestimate the power \\nof obsessive love. ... \\n\\n“And now,” said Slughorn, “it is time for us to start \\nwork.” \\n\\n“Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” said \\nErnie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron \\nstanding on Slughorn ’s desk. The potion within was \\nsplashing about merrily; it was the color of molten \\ngold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above \\nthe surface, though not a particle had spilled. \\n\\nPage | 208 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that \\nSlughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had \\nwaited to be asked for dramatic effect. “Yes. That. \\nWell, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most \\ncurious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he \\nturned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out \\nan audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis \\ndoes, Miss Granger?” \\n\\n“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes \\nyou lucky!” \\n\\nThe whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. \\nNow all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his \\nsleek blond head, because he was at last giving \\nSlughorn his full and undivided attention. \\n\\n“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. \\nYes, it’s a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,” said \\nSlughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and \\ndisastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, \\nas this has been, you will find that all your endeavors \\ntend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.” \\n\\n“Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?” said \\nTerry Boot eagerly. \\n\\n“Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, \\nrecklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,” said \\nSlughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you know ... \\nhighly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, \\nand very occasionally ...” \\n\\n“Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner \\nwith great interest. \\n\\n“Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was \\ntwenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 209 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect \\ndays.” \\n\\nHe gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was \\nplayacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good. \\n\\n“And that,” said Slughorn, apparently coming back to \\nearth, “is what I shall be offering as a prize in this \\nlesson.” \\n\\nThere was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of \\nthe surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold. \\n\\n“One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn, taking \\na minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his \\npocket and showing it to them all. “Enough for twelve \\nhours’ luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in \\neverything you attempt. \\n\\n“Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a \\nbanned substance in organized competitions . . . \\nsporting events, for instance, examinations, or \\nelections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary \\nday only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes \\nextraordinary! \\n\\n“So,” said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, “how are you to \\nwin my fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of \\nAdvanced Potion-Making. We have a little over an hour \\nleft to us, which should be time for you to make a \\ndecent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know \\nit is more complex than anything you have attempted \\nbefore, and I do not expect a perfect potion from \\nanybody. The person who does best, however, will win \\nlittle Felix here. Off you go!” \\n\\nThere was a scraping as everyone drew their \\ncauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as \\npeople began adding weights to their scales, but \\n\\nPage | 210 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnobody spoke. The concentration within the room was \\nalmost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly \\nthrough his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. It could \\nnot have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that \\nlucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book \\nSlughorn had lent him. \\n\\nTo his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had \\nscribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were \\nas black as the printed portions. Bending low to \\ndecipher the ingredients (even here, the previous \\nowner had made annotations and crossed things out) \\nHarry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find \\nwhat he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, \\nhe saw Malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he \\ncould. \\n\\nEveryone kept glancing around at what the rest of the \\nclass was doing; this was both an advantage and a \\ndisadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your \\nwork private. Within ten minutes, the whole place \\nwas full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed \\nto have progressed furthest. Her potion already \\nresembled the “smooth, black currant-colored liquid” \\nmentioned as the ideal halfway stage. \\n\\nHaving finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low \\nover his book again. It was really very irritating, \\nhaving to try and decipher the directions under all the \\nstupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some \\nreason had taken issue with the order to cut up the \\nsopophorous bean and had written in the alternative \\ninstruction: \\n\\nCrush with flat side of silver dagger, \\nreleases juice better than cutting. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 211 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas \\nMalfoy?” \\n\\nHarry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the \\nSlytherin table. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, “I \\nwas sorry to hear he had died, although of course it \\nwasn’t unexpected, dragon pox at his age. ...” \\n\\nAnd he walked away. Harry bent back over his \\ncauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had \\nexpected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps \\neven hoped for some preferential treatment of the type \\nhe had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as \\nthough Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but \\ntalent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis. \\n\\nThe sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to \\ncut up. Harry turned to Hermione. \\n\\n“Can I borrow your silver knife?” \\n\\nShe nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her \\npotion, which was still deep purple, though according \\nto the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac \\nby now. \\n\\nHarry crushed his bean with the flat side of the \\ndagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded \\nso much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean \\ncould have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the \\ncauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion \\nimmediately turned exactly the shade of lilac \\ndescribed by the textbook. \\n\\nHis annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on \\nthe spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of \\ninstructions. According to the book, he had to stir \\n\\nPage | 212 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncounterclockwise until the potion turned clear as \\nwater. According to the addition the previous owner \\nhad made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir \\nafter every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the \\nold owner be right twice? \\n\\nHarry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and \\nstirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The \\npotion turned palest pink. \\n\\n“How are you doing that?” demanded Hermione, who \\nwas red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier \\nand bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her \\npotion was still resolutely purple. \\n\\n“Add a clockwise stir — ” \\n\\n“No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she \\nsnapped. \\n\\nHarry shrugged and continued what he was doing. \\nSeven stirs counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause ... \\nseven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise ... \\n\\nAcross the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his \\nbreath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry \\nglanced around. As far as he could see, no one else’s \\npotion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, \\nsomething that had certainly never happened before \\nin this dungeon. \\n\\n“And time’s ... up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stirring, \\nplease!” \\n\\nSlughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into \\ncauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally \\ngave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached \\nthe table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie \\nwere sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike \\nPage | 213 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsubstance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over Ernie’s \\nnavy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an \\napproving nod. Then he saw Harry’s, and a look of \\nincredulous delight spread over his face. \\n\\n“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. \\n\\n“Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it’s clear \\nyou’ve inherited your mother’s talent. She was a dab \\nhand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here \\nyou are — one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and \\nuse it well!” \\n\\nHarry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his \\ninner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at \\nthe furious looks on the Slytherins’ faces and guilt at \\nthe disappointed expression on Hermione’s. Ron \\nlooked simply dumbfounded. \\n\\n“How did you do that?” he whispered to Harry as they \\nleft the dungeon. \\n\\n“Got lucky, I suppose,” said Harry, because Malfoy \\nwas within earshot. \\n\\nOnce they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor \\ntable for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell \\nthem. Hermione’s face became stonier with every \\nword he uttered. \\n\\n“I s’pose you think I cheated?” he finished, aggravated \\nby her expression. \\n\\n“Well, it wasn’t exactly your own work, was it?” she \\nsaid stiffly. \\n\\n“He only followed different instructions to ours,” said \\nRon. “Could’ve been a catastrophe, couldn’t it? But he \\ntook a risk and it paid off.” He heaved a sigh. \\n“Slughorn could’ve handed me that book, but no, I get \\n\\nPage | 214 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe one no one’s ever written on. Puked on, by the \\nlook of page fifty-two, but — ” \\n\\n“Hang on,” said a voice close by Harry’s left ear and \\nhe caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had \\npicked up in Slughorn’s dungeon. He looked around \\nand saw that Ginny had joined them. “Did I hear \\nright? You’ve been taking orders from something \\nsomeone wrote in a book, Harry?” \\n\\nShe looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was \\non her mind at once. \\n\\n“It’s nothing,” he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. \\n“It’s not like, you know, Riddle’s diary. It’s just an old \\ntextbook someone’s scribbled on.” \\n\\n“But you’re doing what it says?” \\n\\n“I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, \\nhonestly, Ginny, there’s nothing funny — ” \\n\\n“Ginny’s got a point,” said Hermione, perking up at \\nonce. “We ought to check that there’s nothing odd \\nabout it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who \\nknows?” \\n\\n“Hey!” said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy \\nof Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised \\nher wand. \\n\\n“ Specialis Revelio\\\\” she said, rapping it smartly on the \\nfront cover. \\n\\nNothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay \\nthere, looking old and dirty and dog-eared. \\n\\n“Finished?” said Harry irritably. “Or d’you want to \\nwait and see if it does a few backflips?” \\n\\nPage | 215 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It seems all right,” said Hermione, still staring at the \\nbook suspiciously. “I mean, it really does seem to be \\n... just a textbook.” \\n\\n“Good. Then I’ll have it back,” said Harry, snatching it \\noff the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed \\nopen on the floor. \\n\\nNobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve \\nthe book, and as he did so, he saw something \\nscribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the \\nsame small, cramped handwriting as the instructions \\nthat had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now \\nsafely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk \\nupstairs. \\n\\nThis Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 216 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE HOUSE OF GAUNT \\n\\nFor the rest of the week’s Potions lessons Harry \\ncontinued to follow the Half-Blood Prince’s \\ninstructions wherever they deviated from Libatius \\nBorage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson \\nSlughorn was raving about Harry’s abilities, saying \\nthat he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither \\nRon nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although \\nHarry had offered to share his book with both of \\nthem, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the \\nhandwriting than Harry did, and could not keep \\nasking Harry to read aloud or it might look \\nsuspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely \\nplowing on with what she called the “official” \\ninstructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered \\nas they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s. \\n\\nHarry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince \\nhad been. Although the amount of homework they \\nhad been given prevented him from reading the whole \\nof his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had \\nskimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was \\n\\nPage | 217 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbarely a page on which the Prince had not made \\nadditional notes, not all of them concerned with \\npotion-making. Here and there were directions for \\nwhat looked like spells that the Prince had made up \\nhimself. \\n\\n“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing \\nHarry pointing some of these out to Ron in the \\ncommon room on Saturday evening. “It might have \\nbeen a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a \\ngirl’s than a boy’s.” \\n\\n“The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,” Harry said. \\n“How many girls have been Princes?” \\n\\nHermione seemed to have no answer to this. She \\nmerely scowled and twitched her essay on The \\nPrinciples of Re materialization away from Ron, who \\nwas trying to read it upside down. \\n\\nHarry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old \\ncopy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag. \\n\\n“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for \\nDumbledore.” \\n\\n“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good \\nluck! We’ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches \\nyou!” \\n\\n“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them \\nwatched Harry leave through the portrait hole. \\n\\nHarry proceeded through deserted corridors, though \\nhe had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor \\nTrelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to \\nherself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing \\ncards, reading them as she walked. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 218 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Two of spades: conflict,” she murmured, as she \\npassed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \\n“Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. \\nKnave of spades: a dark young man, possibly \\ntroubled, one who dislikes the questioner — ” \\n\\nShe stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry’s \\nstatue. \\n\\n“Well, that can’t be right,” she said, annoyed, and \\nHarry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off \\nagain, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry \\nbehind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she \\nhad gone, then hurried off again until he reached the \\nspot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single \\ngargoyle stood against the wall. \\n\\n“Acid Pops,” said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; \\nthe wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral \\nstone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry \\nstepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up \\nto the door with the brass knocker that led to \\nDumbledore’s office. \\n\\nHarry knocked. \\n\\n“Come in,” said Dumbledore’s voice. \\n\\n“Good evening, sir,” said Harry, walking into the \\nheadmaster’s office. \\n\\n“Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,” said \\nDumbledore, smiling. “I hope you’ve had an enjoyable \\nfirst week back at school?” \\n\\n“Yes, thanks, sir,” said Harry. \\n\\n“You must have been busy, a detention under your \\nbelt already!” \\n\\nPage | 219 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Er,” began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did \\nnot look too stern. \\n\\n“I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will \\ndo your detention next Saturday instead.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry, who had more pressing matters \\non his mind than S nape’s detention, and now looked \\naround surreptitiously for some indication of what \\nDumbledore was planning to do with him this \\nevening. The circular office looked just as it always \\ndid; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle- \\nlegged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of \\nprevious headmasters and headmistresses dozed in \\ntheir frames, and Dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix, \\nFawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching \\nHarry with bright interest. It did not even look as \\nthough Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling \\npractice. \\n\\n“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \\n“You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have \\nplanned for you during these — for want of a better \\nword — lessons?” \\n\\n“Yes, sir.” \\n\\n“Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you \\nknow what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill \\nyou fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain \\ninformation.” \\n\\nThere was a pause. \\n\\n“You said, at the end of last term, you were going to \\ntell me everything,” said Harry. It was hard to keep a \\nnote of accusation from his voice. “Sir,” he added. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 220 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And so I did,” said Dumbledore placidly. “I told you \\neverything I know. From this point forth, we shall be \\nleaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying \\ntogether through the murky marshes of memory into \\nthickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, \\n\\nHarry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey \\nBelcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese \\ncauldron.” \\n\\n“But you think you’re right?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I \\nmake mistakes like the next man. In fact, being — \\nforgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my \\nmistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” \\n\\n“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “does what you’re going \\nto tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will \\nit help me . . . survive?” \\n\\n“It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,” said \\nDumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him \\nabout the next day’s weather, “and I certainly hope \\nthat it will help you to survive.” \\n\\nDumbledore got to his feet and walked around the \\ndesk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to \\nwatch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside \\nthe door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was \\nholding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with \\nodd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve \\non the desk in front of Harry. \\n\\n“You look worried.” \\n\\nHarry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some \\napprehension. His previous experiences with the odd \\ndevice that stored and revealed thoughts and \\nmemories, though highly instructive, had also been \\n\\nPage | 221 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nuncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its \\ncontents, he had seen much more than he would \\nhave wished. But Dumbledore was smiling. \\n\\n“This time, you enter the Pensieve with me ... and, \\neven more unusually, with permission.” \\n\\n“Where are we going, sir?” \\n\\n“For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane,” said \\nDumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle \\ncontaining a swirling silvery- white substance. \\n\\n“Who was Bob Ogden?” \\n\\n“He was employed by the Department of Magical Law \\nEnforcement,” said Dumbledore. “He died some time \\nago, but not before I had tracked him down and \\npersuaded him to confide these recollections to me. \\n\\nWe are about to accompany him on a visit he made in \\nthe course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry ...” \\n\\nBut Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the \\nstopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed \\nstiff and painful. \\n\\n“Shall — shall I, sir?” \\n\\n“No matter, Harry — ” \\n\\nDumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the \\ncork flew out. \\n\\n“Sir — how did you injure your hand?” Harry asked \\nagain, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture \\nof revulsion and pity. \\n\\n“Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. \\nWe have an appointment with Bob Ogden.” \\n\\nPage | 222 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle \\ninto the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, \\nneither liquid nor gas. \\n\\n“After you,” said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the \\nbowl. \\n\\nHarry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged \\nhis face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet \\nleave the office floor; he was falling, falling through \\nwhirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was \\nblinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had \\nadjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him. \\n\\nThey were standing in a country lane bordered by \\nhigh, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as \\nbright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in \\nfront of them stood a short, plump man wearing \\nenormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to \\nmolelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost \\nthat was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand \\nside of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he \\nwas the only person in sight, and he was also wearing \\nthe strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by \\ninexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in \\nthis case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one- \\npiece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do \\nmore than register his bizarre appearance, however, \\nOgden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. \\n\\nDumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the \\nwooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The \\none pointing back the way they had come read: \\n\\nGREAT HANGLETON, 5 MILES. The arm pointing \\nafter Ogden said LITTLE HANGLETON, 1 MILE. \\n\\nThey walked a short way with nothing to see but the \\nhedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the \\nswishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane \\n\\nPage | 223 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncurved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down \\na hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected \\nview of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry \\ncould see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, \\nnestled between two steep hills, its church and \\ngraveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the \\nopposite hillside, was a handsome manor house \\nsurrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. \\n\\nOgden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the \\nsteep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his \\nstride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought \\nLittle Hangleton must be their final destination and \\nwondered, as he had done on the night they had \\nfound Slughorn, why they had to approach it from \\nsuch a distance. He soon discovered that he was \\nmistaken in thinking that they were going to the \\nvillage, however. The lane curved to the right and \\nwhen they rounded the corner, it was to see the very \\nedge of Ogden’s frock coat vanishing through a gap in \\nthe hedge. \\n\\nDumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow \\ndirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows \\nthan those they had left behind. The path was \\ncrooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like \\nthe last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch \\nof dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the \\ntrack soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore \\nand Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had \\nstopped and drawn his wand. \\n\\nDespite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast \\ndeep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds \\nbefore Harry’s eyes discerned the building half-hidden \\namongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very \\nstrange location to choose for a house, or else an odd \\ndecision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking \\nall light and the view of the valley below. He wondered \\nPage | 224 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so \\nmany tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were \\nvisible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips \\nreaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with \\ngrime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could \\npossibly live there, however, one of the windows was \\nthrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam \\nor smoke issued from it, as though somebody was \\ncooking. \\n\\nOgden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, \\nrather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees \\nslid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front \\ndoor, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. \\n\\nThen there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in \\nrags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his \\nfeet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so \\nfast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and \\nstumbled. \\n\\n“ You’re not welcome.” \\n\\nThe man standing before them had thick hair so \\nmatted with dirt it could have been any color. Several \\nof his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and \\ndark and stared in opposite directions. He might have \\nlooked comical, but he did not; the effect was \\nfrightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for \\nbacking away several more paces before he spoke. \\n\\n“Er — good morning. I’m from the Ministry of Magic \\n\\n\\n\\n“ You’re not welcome.” \\n\\n“Er — I’m sorry — I don’t understand you,” said \\nOgden nervously. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 225 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the \\nstranger was making himself very clear in Harry’s \\nopinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in \\none hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the \\nother. \\n\\n“You understand him, I’m sure, Harry?” said \\nDumbledore quietly. \\n\\n“Yes, of course,” said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \\n\\n“Why can’t Ogden — ?” \\n\\nBut as his eyes found the dead snake on the door \\nagain, he suddenly understood. \\n\\n“He’s speaking Parseltongue?” \\n\\n“Very good,” said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. \\n\\nThe man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife \\nin one hand, wand in the other. \\n\\n“Now, look — ” Ogden began, but too late: There was a \\nbang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his \\nnose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from \\nbetween his fingers. \\n\\n“Morfin!” said a loud voice. \\n\\nAn elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, \\nbanging the door behind him so that the dead snake \\nswung pathetically. This man was shorter than the \\nfirst, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very \\nbroad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright \\nbrown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, \\ngave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He \\ncame to a halt beside the man with the knife, who \\nwas now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden \\non the ground. \\n\\nPage | 226 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ministry, is it?” said the older man, looking down at \\nOgden. \\n\\n“Correct!” said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. “And \\nyou, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?” \\n\\n“S’right,” said Gaunt. “Got you in the face, did he?” \\n\\n“Yes, he did!” snapped Ogden. \\n\\n“Should’ve made your presence known, shouldn’t \\nyou?” said Gaunt aggressively. “This is private \\nproperty. Can’t just walk in here and not expect my \\nson to defend himself.” \\n\\n“Defend himself against what, man?” said Ogden, \\nclambering back to his feet. \\n\\n“Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.” \\n\\nOgden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was \\nstill issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow \\npus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke \\nout of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. \\n\\n“Get in the house. Don’t argue.” \\n\\nThis time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; \\neven while he could understand what was being said, \\nhe distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all \\nOgden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point \\nof disagreeing, but when his father cast him a \\nthreatening look he changed his mind, lumbering \\naway to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and \\nslamming the front door behind him, so that the \\nsnake swung sadly again. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 227 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s your son I’m here to see, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, \\nas he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his \\ncoat. “That was Morfin, wasn’t it?” \\n\\n“Ar, that was Morfin,” said the old man indifferently. \\n“Are you pure-blood?” he asked, suddenly aggressive. \\n\\n“That’s neither here nor there,” said Ogden coldly, \\nand Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently \\nGaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden’s \\nface and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to \\nbe an offensive tone, “Now I come to think about it, \\n\\nI’ve seen noses like yours down in the village.” \\n\\n“I don’t doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them,” \\nsaid Ogden. “Perhaps we could continue this \\ndiscussion inside?” \\n\\n“Inside?” \\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I’ve already told you. I’m here about \\nMorfin. We sent an owl — ” \\n\\n“I’ve no use for owls,” said Gaunt. “I don’t open \\nletters.” \\n\\n“Then you can hardly complain that you get no \\nwarning of visitors,” said Ogden tartly. “I am here \\nfollowing a serious breach of Wizarding law, which \\noccurred here in the early hours of this morning — ” \\n\\n“All right, all right, all right!” bellowed Gaunt. “Come \\nin the bleeding house, then, and much good it’ll do \\nyou!” \\n\\nThe house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two \\ndoors led off the main room, which served as kitchen \\nand living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a \\nfilthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live \\n\\nPage | 228 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nadder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at \\nit in Parseltongue: \\n\\nHissy, hissy, little snakey, \\n\\nSlither on the floor, \\n\\nYou be good to Morfin \\nOr hell nail you to the door. \\n\\nThere was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the \\nopen window, and Harry realized that there was \\nsomebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray \\ndress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall \\nbehind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot \\non a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with \\nthe shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. \\nHer hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, \\nrather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother’s, stared \\nin opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than \\nthe two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a \\nmore defeated-looking person. \\n\\n“M’daughter, Merope,” said Gaunt grudgingly, as \\nOgden looked inquiringly toward her. \\n\\n“Good morning,” said Ogden. \\n\\nShe did not answer, but with a frightened glance at \\nher father turned her back on the room and \\ncontinued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her. \\n\\n“Well, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, “to get straight to the \\npoint, we have reason to believe that your son, \\n\\nMorfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last \\nnight.” \\n\\nThere was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped \\none of the pots. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 229 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pick it up\\\\” Gaunt bellowed at her. “That’s it, grub on \\nthe floor like some filthy Muggle, what’s your wand \\nfor, you useless sack of muck?” \\n\\n“Mr. Gaunt, please!” said Ogden in a shocked voice, \\nas Merope, who had already picked up the pot, \\nflushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot \\nagain, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, \\npointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible \\nspell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor \\naway from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in \\ntwo. \\n\\nMorfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt \\nscreamed, “Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!” \\n\\nMerope stumbled across the room, but before she had \\ntime to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and \\nsaid firmly, “Reparo.” The pot mended itself instantly. \\n\\nGaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to \\nshout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: \\nInstead, he jeered at his daughter, “Lucky the nice \\nman from the Ministry’s here, isn’t it? Perhaps he’ll \\ntake you off my hands, perhaps he doesn’t mind dirty \\nSquibs. ...” \\n\\nWithout looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, \\nMerope picked up the pot and returned it, hands \\ntrembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her \\nback against the wall between the filthy window and \\nthe stove, as though she wished for nothing more \\nthan to sink into the stone and vanish. \\n\\n“Mr. Gaunt,” Ogden began again, “as I’ve said: the \\nreason for my visit — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 230 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I heard you the first time!” snapped Gaunt. “And so \\nwhat? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming \\nto him — what about it, then?” \\n\\n“Morfin has broken Wizarding law,” said Ogden \\nsternly. \\n\\n“ ‘Morfin has broken Wizarding law.’ ” Gaunt imitated \\nOgden’s voice, making it pompous and singsong. \\nMorfin cackled again. “He taught a filthy Muggle a \\nlesson, that’s illegal now, is it?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Ogden. “I’m afraid it is.” \\n\\nHe pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of \\nparchment and unrolled it. \\n\\n“What’s that, then, his sentence?” said Gaunt, his \\nvoice rising angrily. \\n\\n“It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing — ” \\n\\n“Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, \\nsummoning my son anywhere?” \\n\\n“I’m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,” \\nsaid Ogden. \\n\\n“And you think we’re scum, do you?” screamed \\nGaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow- \\nnailed finger pointing at his chest. “Scum who’ll come \\nrunning when the Ministry tells ’em to? Do you know \\nwho you’re talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do \\nyou? \\n\\n“I was under the impression that I was speaking to \\nMr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, looking wary, but standing \\nhis ground. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 231 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s right!” roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry \\nthought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, \\nbut then realized that he was showing Ogden the \\nugly, black- stoned ring he was wearing on his middle \\nfinger, waving it before Ogden’s eyes. “See this? See \\nthis? Know what it is? Know where it came from? \\nCenturies it’s been in our family, that’s how far back \\nwe go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much \\nI’ve been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of \\narms engraved on the stone?” \\n\\n“I’ve really no idea,” said Ogden, blinking as the ring \\nsailed within an inch of his nose, “and it’s quite \\nbeside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed \\n\\n\\n\\nWith a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. \\nFor a split second, Harry thought he was going to \\nthrottle her as his hand flew to her throat; next \\nmoment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold \\nchain around her neck. \\n\\n“See this?” he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy \\ngold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and \\ngasped for breath. \\n\\n“I see it, I see it!” said Ogden hastily. \\n\\n“Slytherin’sl” yelled Gaunt. “Salazar Slytherin’s! We’re \\nhis last living descendants, what do you say to that, \\neh?” \\n\\n“Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!” said Ogden in alarm, but \\nGaunt had already released Merope; she staggered \\naway from him, back to her corner, massaging her \\nneck and gulping for air. \\n\\n“So!” said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just \\nproved a complicated point beyond all possible \\n\\nPage | 232 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndispute. “Don’t you go talking to us as if we’re dirt on \\nyour shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all — \\nmore than you can say, I don’t doubt!” \\n\\nAnd he spat on the floor at Ogden’s feet. Morfin \\ncackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, \\nher head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, \\nsaid nothing. \\n\\n“Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden doggedly, “I am afraid that \\nneither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do \\nwith the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, \\nMorfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. \\n\\nOur information” — he glanced down at his scroll of \\nparchment — “is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex \\non the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly \\npainful hives.” \\n\\nMorfin giggled. \\n\\n“ Be quiet, boy,” snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and \\nMorfin fell silent again. \\n\\n“And so what if he did, then?” Gaunt said defiantly to \\nOgden. “I expect you’ve wiped the Muggle ’s filthy face \\nclean for him, and his memory to boot — ” \\n\\n“That’s hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?” said \\nOgden. “This was an unprovoked attack on a \\ndefenseless — ” \\n\\n“Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the \\nmoment I saw you,” sneered Gaunt, and he spat on \\nthe floor again. \\n\\n“This discussion is getting us nowhere,” said Ogden \\nfirmly. “It is clear from your son’s attitude that he \\nfeels no remorse for his actions.” He glanced down at \\nhis scroll of parchment again. “Morfin will attend a \\n\\nPage | 233 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the \\ncharges of using magic in front of a Muggle and \\ncausing harm and distress to that same Mugg — ” \\n\\nOgden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of \\nhorses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in \\nthrough the open window. Apparently the winding \\nlane to the village passed very close to the copse \\nwhere the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his \\neyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward \\nthe sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her \\nhead. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white. \\n\\n“My God, what an eyesore!” rang out a girl’s voice, as \\nclearly audible through the open window as if she had \\nstood in the room beside them. “Couldn’t your father \\nhave that hovel cleared away, Tom?” \\n\\n“It’s not ours,” said a young man’s voice. “Everything \\non the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that \\ncottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his \\nchildren. The son’s quite mad, you should hear some \\nof the stories they tell in the village — ” \\n\\nThe girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were \\ngrowing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of \\nhis armchair. \\n\\n“Keep your seat,” said his father warningly, in \\nParseltongue. \\n\\n“Tom,” said the girl’s voice again, now so close they \\nwere clearly right beside the house, “I might be wrong \\n— but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?” \\n\\n“Good lord, you’re right!” said the man’s voice. “That’ll \\nbe the son, I told you he’s not right in the head. Don’t \\nlook at it, Cecilia, darling.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 234 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe jingling and clopping sounds were now growing \\nfainter again. \\n\\n“ ‘Darling,’ ” whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, \\nlooking at his sister. “ ‘Darling,’ he called her. So he \\nwouldn’t have you anyway.” \\n\\nMerope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to \\nfaint. \\n\\n“What’s that?” said Gaunt sharply, also in \\nParseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. \\n\\n“ What did you say, Morfin?” \\n\\n“She likes looking at that Muggle,” said Morfin, a \\nvicious expression on his face as he stared at his \\nsister, who now looked terrified. “Always in the \\ngarden when he passes, peering through the hedge at \\nhim, isn’t she? And last night — ” \\n\\nMerope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but \\nMorfin went on ruthlessly, “Hanging out of the \\nwindow waiting for him to ride home, wasn’t she?” \\n\\n“Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?” said \\nGaunt quietly. \\n\\nAll three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten \\nOgden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated \\nat this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing \\nand rasping. \\n\\n“Is it true?” said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a \\nstep or two toward the terrified girl. “My daughter — \\npure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin — \\nhankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?” \\n\\nMerope shook her head frantically, pressing herself \\ninto the wall, apparently unable to speak. \\n\\nPage | 235 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But I got him, FatheA” cackled Morfin. “I got him as \\nhe went by and he didn’t look so pretty with hives all \\nover him, did he, Merope?” \\n\\n“You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood \\ntraitoA.” roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands \\nclosed around his daughter’s throat. \\n\\nBoth Harry and Ogden yelled “No!” at the same time; \\nOgden raised his wand and cried, “Relashiol” Gaunt \\nwas thrown backward, away from his daughter; he \\ntripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a \\nroar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at \\nOgden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes \\nindiscriminately from his wand. \\n\\nOgden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they \\nought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope ’s screams \\nechoing in his ears. \\n\\nOgden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main \\nlane, his arms over his head, where he collided with \\nthe glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, \\ndark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl \\nriding beside him on a gray horse roared with \\nlaughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the \\nhorse’s flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, \\ncovered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell \\nup the lane. \\n\\n“I think that will do, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He \\ntook Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, \\nthey were both soaring weightlessly through \\ndarkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, \\nback in Dumbledore ’s now twilit office. \\n\\n“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said Harry \\nat once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of \\nhis wand. “Merope, or whatever her name was?” \\n\\nPage | 236 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, she survived,” said Dumbledore, reseating \\nhimself behind his desk and indicating that Harry \\nshould sit down too. “Ogden Apparated back to the \\nMinistry and returned with reinforcements within \\nfifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to \\nfight, but both were overpowered, removed from the \\ncottage, and subsequently convicted by the \\nWizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of \\nMuggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in \\nAzkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry \\nemployees in addition to Ogden, received six months.” \\n\\n“Marvolo?” Harry repeated wonderingly. \\n\\n“That’s right,” said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. \\n\\n“I am glad to see you’re keeping up.” \\n\\n“That old man was — ?” \\n\\n“Voldemort’s grandfather, yes,” said Dumbledore. \\n“Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, \\nwere the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding \\nfamily noted for a vein of instability and violence that \\nflourished through the generations due to their habit \\nof marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled \\nwith a great liking for grandeur meant that the family \\ngold was squandered several generations before \\nMarvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor \\nand poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic \\namount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of \\nfamily heirlooms that he treasured just as much as \\nhis son, and rather more than his daughter.” \\n\\n“So Merope,” said Harry, leaning forward in his chair \\nand staring at Dumbledore, “so Merope was ... Sir, \\ndoes that mean she was ... Voldemort’s mother?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 237 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It does,” said Dumbledore. “And it so happens that \\nwe also had a glimpse of Voldemort’s father. I wonder \\nwhether you noticed?” \\n\\n“The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the \\nhorse?” \\n\\n“Very good indeed,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Yes, \\nthat was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle \\nwho used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for \\nwhom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning \\npassion.” \\n\\n“And they ended up married?” Harry said in disbelief, \\nunable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. \\n\\n“I think you are forgetting,” said Dumbledore, “that \\nMerope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical \\npowers appeared to their best advantage when she \\nwas being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and \\nMorfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone \\nand free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, \\nshe was able to give full rein to her abilities and to \\nplot her escape from the desperate life she had led for \\neighteen years. \\n\\n“Can you not think of any measure Merope could \\nhave taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle \\ncompanion, and fall in love with her instead?” \\n\\n“The Imperius Curse?” Harry suggested. “Or a love \\npotion?” \\n\\n“Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she \\nused a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed \\nmore romantic to her, and I do not think it would \\nhave been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle \\nwas riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of \\nwater. In any case, within a few months of the scene \\nPage | 238 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton \\nenjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the \\ngossip it caused when the squire’s son ran off with \\nthe tramp’s daughter, Merope. \\n\\n“But the villagers’ shock was nothing to Marvolo’s. He \\nreturned from Azkaban, expecting to find his \\ndaughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal \\nready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of \\ndust and her note of farewell, explaining what she \\nhad done. \\n\\n“From all that I have been able to discover, he never \\nmentioned her name or existence from that time \\nforth. The shock of her desertion may have \\ncontributed to his early death — or perhaps he had \\nsimply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had \\ngreatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see \\nMorfin return to the cottage.” \\n\\n“And Merope? She ... she died, didn’t she? Wasn’t \\nVoldemort brought up in an orphanage?” \\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” said Dumbledore. “We must do a \\ncertain amount of guessing here, although I do not \\nthink it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, \\nwithin a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom \\nRiddle reappeared at the manor house in Little \\nHangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around \\nthe neighborhood that he was talking of being \\n‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’ What he meant, I am \\nsure, is that he had been under an enchantment that \\nhad now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use \\nthose precise words for fear of being thought insane. \\nWhen they heard what he was saying, however, the \\nvillagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, \\npretending that she was going to have his baby, and \\nthat he had married her for this reason.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 239 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But she did have his baby.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“But not until a year after they were married. Tom \\nRiddle left her while she was still pregnant.” \\n\\n“What went wrong?” asked Harry. “Why did the love \\npotion stop working?” \\n\\n“Again, this is guesswork,” said Dumbledore, “but I \\nbelieve that Merope, who was deeply in love with her \\nhusband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by \\nmagical means. I believe that she made the choice to \\nstop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she \\nwas, she had convinced herself that he would by now \\nhave fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she \\nthought he would stay for the baby’s sake. If so, she \\nwas wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her \\nagain, and never troubled to discover what became of \\nhis son.” \\n\\nThe sky outside was inky black and the lamps in \\nDumbledore ’s office seemed to glow more brightly \\nthan before. \\n\\n“I think that will do for tonight, Harry,” said \\nDumbledore after a moment or two. \\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Harry. \\n\\nHe got to his feet, but did not leave. \\n\\n“Sir ... is it important to know all this about \\nVoldemort’s past?” \\n\\n“Very important, I think,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“And it ... it’s got something to do with the prophecy?” \\n\\n“It has everything to do with the prophecy.” \\n\\nPage | 240 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Right,” said Harry, a little confused, but reassured \\nall the same. \\n\\nHe turned to go, then another question occurred to \\nhim, and he turned back again. “Sir, am I allowed to \\ntell Ron and Hermione everything you’ve told me?” \\n\\nDumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, \\n“Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have \\nproved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going \\nto ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to \\nanybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got \\naround how much I know, or suspect, about Lord \\nVoldemort’s secrets.” \\n\\n“No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just Ron and Hermione. \\nGood night.” \\n\\nHe turned away again, and was almost at the door \\nwhen he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle- \\nlegged tables that supported so many frail-looking \\nsilver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a \\nlarge, cracked, black stone. \\n\\n“Sir,” said Harry, staring at it. “That ring — ” \\n\\n“Yes?” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“You were wearing it when we visited Professor \\nSlughorn that night.” \\n\\n“So I was,” Dumbledore agreed. \\n\\n“But isn’t it ... sir, isn’t it the same ring Marvolo \\nGaunt showed Ogden?” \\n\\nDumbledore bowed his head. “The very same.” \\n\\n“But how come — ? Have you always had it?” \\n\\nPage | 241 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, I acquired it very recently,” said Dumbledore. “A \\nfew days before I came to fetch you from your aunt \\nand uncle’s, in fact.” \\n\\n“That would be around the time you injured your \\nhand, then, sir?” \\n\\n“Around that time, yes, Harry.” \\n\\nHarry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling. \\n\\n“Sir, how exactly — ?” \\n\\n“Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another \\ntime. Good night.” \\n\\n“Good night, sir.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 242 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHERMIONE’S HELPING HAND \\n\\nAs Hermione had predicted, the sixth years’ free \\nperiods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron \\nhad anticipated, but times in which to attempt to \\nkeep up with the vast amount of homework they were \\nbeing set. Not only were they studying as though they \\nhad exams every day, but the lessons themselves had \\nbecome more demanding than ever before. Harry \\nbarely understood half of what Professor McGonagall \\nsaid to them these days; even Hermione had had to \\nask her to repeat instructions once or twice. \\nIncredibly, and to Hermione ’s increasing resentment, \\nHarry’s best subject had suddenly become Potions, \\nthanks to the Half-Blood Prince. \\n\\nNonverbal spells were now expected, not only in \\nDefense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and \\nTransfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at \\nhis classmates in the common room or at mealtimes \\nto see them purple in the face and straining as \\nthough they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew \\nthat they were really struggling to make spells work \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 243 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nwithout saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to \\nget outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing \\nwith more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, \\nbut at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if \\nthe Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly \\nfrom behind. \\n\\nOne result of their enormous workload and the frantic \\nhours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, \\nRon, and Hermione had so far been unable to find \\ntime to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to \\nmeals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the \\nfew occasions when they had passed him in the \\ncorridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously \\nfailed to notice them or hear their greetings. \\n\\n“We’ve got to go and explain,” said Hermione, looking \\nup at Hagrid ’s huge empty chair at the staff table the \\nfollowing Saturday at breakfast. \\n\\n“We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron. \\n“And we’re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti \\nCharm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are \\nwe going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?” \\n\\n“We didn’t hate it!” said Hermione. \\n\\n“Speak for yourself, I haven’t forgotten the skrewts,” \\nsaid Ron darkly. “And I’m telling you now, we’ve had a \\nnarrow escape. You didn’t hear him going on about \\nhis gormless brother — we’d have been teaching \\nGrawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed.” \\n\\n“I hate not talking to Hagrid,” said Hermione, looking \\nupset. \\n\\n“Well go down after Quidditch,” Harry assured her. \\n\\nHe too was missing Hagrid, although like Ron he \\nthought that they were better off without Grawp in \\n\\nPage | 244 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir lives. “But trials might take all morning, the \\nnumber of people who have applied.” He felt slightly \\nnervous at confronting the first hurdle of his \\nCaptaincy. “I dunno why the team’s this popular all of \\na sudden.” \\n\\n“Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly \\nimpatient. “It’s not Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you! \\nYou’ve never been more interesting, and frankly, \\nyou’ve never been more fanciable.” \\n\\nRon gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione \\nspared him one look of disdain before turning back to \\nHarry. \\n\\n“Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, \\ndon’t they? The whole Wizarding world has had to \\nadmit that you were right about Voldemort being back \\nand that you really have fought him twice in the last \\ntwo years and escaped both times. And now they’re \\ncalling you ‘the Chosen One’ — well, come on, can’t \\nyou see why people are fascinated by you?” \\n\\nHarry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a \\nsudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and \\nrainy. \\n\\n“And you’ve been through all that persecution from \\nthe Ministry when they were trying to make out you \\nwere unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks \\non the back of your hand where that evil woman \\nmade you write with your own blood, but you stuck to \\nyour story anyway. ...” \\n\\n“You can still see where those brains got hold of me in \\nthe Ministry, look,” said Ron, shaking back his \\nsleeves. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 245 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot \\nover the summer either,” Hermione finished, ignoring \\nRon. \\n\\n“I’m tall,” said Ron inconsequentially. \\n\\nThe post owls arrived, swooping down through rain- \\nflecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of \\nwater. Most people were receiving more post than \\nusual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their \\nchildren and to reassure them, in turn, that all was \\nwell at home. Harry had received no mail since the \\nstart of term; his only regular correspondent was now \\ndead and although he had hoped that Lupin might \\nwrite occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. \\nHe was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy \\nwhite Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray \\nowls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, \\nsquare package. A moment later, an identical package \\nlanded in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his \\nminuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon. \\n\\n“Ha!” said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a \\nnew copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from \\nFlourish and Blotts. \\n\\n“Oh good,” said Hermione, delighted. “Now you can \\ngive that graffitied copy back.” \\n\\n“Are you mad?” said Harry. “I’m keeping it! Look, I’ve \\nthought it out — ” \\n\\nHe pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out \\nof his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, \\nmuttering, “Diffindol” The cover fell off. He did the \\nsame thing with the brand-new book (Hermione \\nlooked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, \\ntapped each, and said, “Reparo\\\\” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 246 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere sat the Prince’s copy, disguised as a new book, \\nand there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, \\nlooking thoroughly secondhand. \\n\\n“I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, he can’t \\ncomplain, it cost nine Galleons.” \\n\\nHermione pressed her lips together, looking angry \\nand disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl \\nlanding in front of her carrying that day’s copy of the \\nDaily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned \\nthe front page. \\n\\n“Anyone we know dead?” asked Ron in a determinedly \\ncasual voice; he posed the same question every time \\nHermione opened her paper. \\n\\n“No, but there have been more dementor attacks,” \\nsaid Hermione. “And an arrest.” \\n\\n“Excellent, who?” said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix \\nLestrange. \\n\\n“Stan Shunpike,” said Hermione. \\n\\n“What?” said Harry, startled. \\n\\n“ ‘Stanley Shunpike , conductor on the popular \\nWizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been \\narrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. \\nShunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night \\nafter a raid on his Clapham home ...’ ” \\n\\n“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, \\nremembering the spotty youth he had first met three \\nyears before. “No way!” \\n\\n“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” \\nsaid Ron reasonably. “You never can tell.” \\n\\nPage | 247 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still \\nreading. “It says here he was arrested after he was \\noverheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret \\nplans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled \\nexpression on her face. “If he was under the Imperius \\nCurse, he’d hardly stand around gossiping about \\ntheir plans, would he?” \\n\\n“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew \\nmore than he did,” said Ron. “Isn’t he the one who \\nclaimed he was going to become Minister of Magic \\nwhen he was trying to chat up those veela?” \\n\\n“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re \\nplaying at, taking Stan seriously.” \\n\\n“They probably want to look as though they’re doing \\nsomething,” said Hermione, frowning. “People are \\nterrified — you know the Patil twins’ parents want \\nthem to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already \\nbeen withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.” \\n\\n“What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “But \\nHogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! \\nWe’ve got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, \\nand we’ve got Dumbledore!” \\n\\n“I don’t think we’ve got him all the time,” said \\nHermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table \\nover the top of the Prophet “Haven’t you noticed? His \\nseat’s been empty as often as Hagrid’s this past \\nweek.” \\n\\nHarry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The \\nheadmaster’s chair was indeed empty. Now Harry \\ncame to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore \\nsince their private lesson a week ago. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 248 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think he’s left the school to do something with the \\nOrder,” said Hermione in a low voice. “I mean ... it’s \\nall looking serious, isn’t it? \\n\\nHarry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that \\nthey were all thinking the same thing. There had been \\na horrible incident the day before, when Hannah \\nAbbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her \\nmother had been found dead. They had not seen \\nHannah since. \\n\\nWhen they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later \\nto head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed \\nLavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what \\nHermione had said about the Patil twins’ parents \\nwanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was \\nunsurprised to see that the two best friends were \\nwhispering together, looking distressed. What did \\nsurprise him was that when Ron drew level with \\nthem, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked \\naround and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at \\nher, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk \\ninstantly became something more like a strut. Harry \\nresisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that \\nRon had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had \\nbroken Harry’s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold \\nand distant all the way down to the stadium through \\nthe cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in \\nthe stands without wishing Ron good luck. \\n\\nAs Harry had expected, the trials took most of the \\nmorning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have \\nturned up, from first years who were nervously \\nclutching a selection of the dreadful old school \\nbrooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, \\nlooking coolly intimidating. The latter included a \\nlarge, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately \\nfrom the Hogwarts Express. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 249 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We met on the train, in old Sluggy’s compartment,” \\nhe said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to \\nshake Harry’s hand. “Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.” \\n\\n“You didn’t try out last year, did you?” asked Harry, \\ntaking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking \\nthat he would probably block all three goal hoops \\nwithout even moving. \\n\\n“I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,” \\nsaid McLaggen, with something of a swagger. “Ate a \\npound of doxy eggs for a bet.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry. “Well ... if you wait over there ...” \\n\\nHe pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to \\nwhere Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a \\nflicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen’s face and \\nwondered whether McLaggen expected preferential \\ntreatment because they were both “old Sluggy’s” \\nfavorites. \\n\\nHarry decided to start with a basic test, asking all \\napplicants for the team to divide into groups of ten \\nand fly once around the pitch. This was a good \\ndecision: The first ten was made up of first years and \\nit could not have been plainer that they had hardly \\never flown before. Only one boy managed to remain \\nairborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so \\nsurprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal \\nposts. \\n\\nThe second group was comprised of ten of the silliest \\ngirls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew \\nhis whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching \\none another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When \\nhe told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite \\ncheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle \\neveryone else. \\n\\nPage | 250 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third group had a pileup halfway around the \\npitch. Most of the fourth group had come without \\nbroomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs. \\n\\n“If there’s anyone else here who’s not from \\nGryffindor,” roared Harry, who was starting to get \\nseriously annoyed, “leave now, please!” \\n\\nThere was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws \\nwent sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter. \\n\\nAfter two hours, many complaints, and several \\ntantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty \\nand several broken teeth, Harry had found himself \\nthree Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after \\nan excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, \\nwho was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and \\nGinny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition \\nand scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though \\nhe was with his choices, Harry had also shouted \\nhimself hoarse at the many complainers and was now \\nenduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters. \\n\\n“That’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of \\nthe way for the Keepers I’ll hex you,” he bellowed. \\n\\nNeither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of \\nFred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased \\nwith them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested \\nthird-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the \\nsize of an egg on the back of Harry’s head with a \\nferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked \\nweedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, \\n\\nDemelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the \\nselection of their last team member. \\n\\nHarry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers \\nuntil last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less \\npressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all \\n\\nPage | 251 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe rejected players and a number of people who had \\ncome down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had \\njoined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than \\never. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the \\ncrowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry \\nglanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem \\nwith nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final \\nmatch last term might have cured it, but apparently \\nnot: Ron was a delicate shade of green. \\n\\nNone of the first five applicants saved more than two \\ngoals apiece. To Harry’s great disappointment, \\n\\nCormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On \\nthe last one, however, he shot off in completely the \\nwrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and \\nMcLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth. \\n\\nRon looked ready to pass out as he mounted his \\nCleansweep Eleven. “Good luck!” cried a voice from \\nthe stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see \\nHermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have \\nquite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as \\nshe did a moment later, but thought that as the \\nCaptain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so \\nturned to watch Ron do his trial. \\n\\nYet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, \\nthree, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and \\nresisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with \\ndifficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, \\nmost unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find \\nMcLaggen’s red face inches from his own. He stepped \\nback hastily. \\n\\n“His sister didn’t really try,” said McLaggen \\nmenacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple \\nlike the one Harry had often admired in Uncle \\nVernon’s. “She gave him an easy save.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 252 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Rubbish,” said Harry coldly. “That was the one he \\nnearly missed.” \\n\\nMcLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his \\nground this time. \\n\\n“Give me another go.” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry. “You’ve had your go. You saved four. \\nRon saved five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it fair and \\nsquare. Get out of my way.” \\n\\nHe thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch \\nhim, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace \\nand stormed away, growling what sounded like \\nthreats to thin air. \\n\\nHarry turned around to find his new team beaming at \\nhim. \\n\\n“Well done,” he croaked. “You flew really well — ” \\n\\n“You did brilliantly, Ron!” \\n\\nThis time it really was Hermione running toward \\nthem from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking \\noff the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather \\ngrumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely \\npleased with himself and even taller than usual as he \\ngrinned at the team and at Hermione. \\n\\nAfter fixing the time of their first full practice for the \\nfollowing Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade \\ngood-bye to the rest of the team and headed off \\ntoward Hagrid’s. A watery sun was trying to break \\nthrough the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling \\nat last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there \\nwould be something to eat at Hagrid’s. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 253 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” \\nRon was saying happily. “Tricky shot from Demelza, \\ndid you see, had a bit of spin on it — ” \\n\\n“Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, \\nlooking amused. \\n\\n“I was better than that McLaggen anyway,” said Ron \\nin a highly satisfied voice. “Did you see him \\nlumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? \\nLooked like he’d been Confunded. ...” \\n\\nTo Harry’s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep \\nshade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he \\nwas too busy describing each of his other penalties in \\nloving detail. \\n\\nThe great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in \\nfront of Hagrid’s cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp \\nbeak at their approach and turned his huge head \\ntoward them. \\n\\n“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit \\nscary, isn’t he?” \\n\\n“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said \\nRon. \\n\\nHarry stepped forward and bowed low to the \\nhippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. \\nAfter a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too. \\n\\n“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, \\nmoving forward to stroke the feathery head. “Missing \\nhim? But you’re okay here with Hagrid, aren’t you?” \\n\\n“Oi!” said a loud voice. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 254 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid had come striding around the corner of his \\ncabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a \\nsack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, \\nwas at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and \\nbounded forward. \\n\\n“Git away from him! Hell have yer fingers — oh. It’s \\nyeh lot.” \\n\\nFang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, \\nattempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked \\nat them all for a split second, then turned and strode \\ninto his cabin, slamming the door behind him. \\n\\n“Oh dear!” said Hermione, looking stricken. \\n\\n“Don’t worry about it,” said Harry grimly. He walked \\nover to the door and knocked loudly. \\n\\n“Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!” \\n\\nThere was no sound from within. \\n\\n“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open!” Harry \\nsaid, pulling out his wand. \\n\\n“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked. “You can’t \\npossibly — ” \\n\\n“Yeah, I can!” said Harry. “Stand back — ” \\n\\nBut before he could say anything else, the door flew \\nopen again as Harry had known it would, and there \\nstood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, \\ndespite the flowery apron, positively alarming. \\n\\n“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! \\nHow dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 255 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Tm sorry, sir,” said Harry, emphasizing the last word \\nas he stowed his wand inside his robes. \\n\\nHagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called \\nme ‘sir’?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?” \\n\\n“Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid. “Very amusin’. \\nThat’s me outsmarted, innit? All righ’, come in then, \\nyeh ungrateful little ...” \\n\\nMumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. \\nHermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather \\nfrightened. \\n\\n“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione sat down around his enormous wooden \\ntable, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harry’s \\nknee and drooling all over his robes. “What’s this? \\nFeelin’ sorry for me? Reckon I’m lonely or summat?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry at once. “We wanted to see you.” \\n\\n“We’ve missed you!” said Hermione tremulously. \\n\\n“Missed me, have yeh?” snorted Hagrid. “Yeah. Righ’.” \\n\\nHe stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous \\ncopper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he \\nslammed down three bucket-sized mugs of \\nmahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of \\nhis rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for \\nHagrid’s cooking, and took one at once. \\n\\n“Hagrid,” said Hermione timidly, when he joined them \\nat the table and started peeling his potatoes with a \\nbrutality that suggested that each tuber had done \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 256 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhim a great personal wrong, “we really wanted to \\ncarry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.” \\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought \\nsome bogeys landed on the potatoes, and was \\ninwardly thankful that they were not staying for \\ndinner. \\n\\n“We did!” said Hermione. “But none of us could fit it \\ninto our schedules!” \\n\\n“Yeah. Righ’,” said Hagrid again. \\n\\nThere was a funny squelching sound and they all \\nlooked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and \\nRon leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table \\naway from the large barrel standing in the corner that \\nthey had only just noticed. It was full of what looked \\nlike foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing. \\n\\n“What are they, Hagrid?” asked Harry, trying to sound \\ninterested rather than revolted, but putting down his \\nrock cake all the same. \\n\\n“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid. \\n\\n“And they grow into ... ?” said Ron, looking \\napprehensive. \\n\\n“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ’em \\nter feed ter Aragog.” \\n\\nAnd without warning, he burst into tears. \\n\\n“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying \\naround the table the long way to avoid the barrel of \\nmaggots, and putting an arm around his shaking \\nshoulders. “What is it?” \\n\\nPage | 257 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s ... him ...” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes \\nstreaming as he mopped his face with his apron. “It’s \\n... Aragog. ... I think he’s dyin’. ... He got ill over the \\nsummer an’ he’s not gettin’ better. ... I don’ know \\nwhat I’ll do if he ... if he ... We’ve bin tergether so \\nlong. ...” \\n\\nHermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a \\ncomplete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how \\nshe felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious \\nbaby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over \\ngiant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to \\nreason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this \\nwas perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his \\nmonster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, \\nwho dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which \\nhe and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years \\npreviously. \\n\\n“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione \\nasked, ignoring Ron’s frantic grimaces and head- \\nshakings. \\n\\n“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, \\nattempting to stem the flood of his tears. “See, the \\nrest o’ the tribe ... Aragog’s family ... they’re gettin’ a \\nbit funny now he’s ill ... bit restive ...” \\n\\n“Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said \\nRon in an undertone. \\n\\n\"... I don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go \\nnear the colony at the mo’,” Hagrid finished, blowing \\nhis nose hard on his apron and looking up. “But \\nthanks fer offerin’, Hermione. ... It means a lot. ...” \\n\\nAfter that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for \\nalthough neither Harry nor Ron had shown any \\ninclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, \\n\\nPage | 258 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for \\ngranted that they would have liked to have done and \\nbecame his usual self once more. \\n\\n“Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me \\ninter yer timetables,” he said gruffly, pouring them \\nmore tea. “Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners — ” \\n\\n“We couldn’t have done,” said Hermione. “We \\nsmashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners \\nwhen we were there last summer. It was in the Daily \\nProphet.” \\n\\n“Ar, well then,” said Hagrid. “There’s no way yeh \\ncould’ve done it. ... I’m sorry I’ve bin — yeh know — \\nI’ve jus’ bin worried abou’ Aragog ... an’ I did wonder \\nwhether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin’ \\nyeh \\n\\nAt which all three of them stated categorically and \\nuntruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had \\nsubstituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful \\nteacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved \\nthem off the premises at dusk, he looked quite \\ncheerful. \\n\\n“I’m starving,” said Harry, once the door had closed \\nbehind them and they were hurrying through the \\ndark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the \\nrock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one \\nof his back teeth. “And I’ve got that detention with \\nSnape tonight, I haven’t got much time for dinner. ...” \\n\\nAs they came into the castle they spotted Cormac \\nMcLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two \\nattempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off \\nthe frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed \\ngloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but \\nHarry caught Hermione ’s arm and held her back. \\n\\nPage | 259 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What?” said Hermione defensively. \\n\\n\\n\\n“If you ask me,” said Harry quietly, “McLaggen looks \\nlike he was Confunded this morning. And he was \\nstanding right in front of where you were sitting.” \\n\\nHermione blushed. \\n\\n“Oh, all right then, I did it,” she whispered. “But you \\nshould have heard the way he was talking about Ron \\nand Ginny! Anyway, he’s got a nasty temper, you saw \\nhow he reacted when he didn’t get in — you wouldn’t \\nhave wanted someone like that on the team.” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry. “No, I suppose that’s true. But \\nwasn’t that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you’re a \\nprefect, aren’t you?” \\n\\n“Oh, be quiet,” she snapped, as he smirked. \\n\\n“What are you two doing?” demanded Ron, \\nreappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and \\nlooking suspicious. \\n\\n“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and \\nthey hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made \\nHarry’s stomach ache with hunger, but they had \\nbarely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table \\nwhen Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, \\nblocking their path. \\n\\n“Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!” he \\nboomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus \\nmustache and puffing out his enormous belly. “I was \\nhoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to \\na spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We’re \\nhaving a little party, just a few rising stars, I’ve got \\nMcLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda \\nBobbin — I don’t know whether you know her? Her \\nPage | 260 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfamily owns a large chain of apothecaries — and, of \\ncourse, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor \\nme by coming too.” \\n\\nSlughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished \\nspeaking. It was as though Ron was not present; \\nSlughorn did not so much as look at him. \\n\\n“I can’t come, Professor,” said Harry at once. “I’ve got \\na detention with Professor Snape.” \\n\\n“Oh dear!” said Slughorn, his face falling comically. \\n“Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, \\nI’ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain \\nthe situation. I’m sure I’ll be able to persuade him to \\npostpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both later!” \\n\\nHe bustled away out of the Hall. \\n\\n“He’s got no chance of persuading Snape,” said Harry, \\nthe moment Slughorn was out of earshot. “This \\ndetention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it \\nfor Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone else.” \\n\\n“Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my \\nown!” said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she \\nwas thinking about McLaggen. \\n\\n“I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited,” \\nsnapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly \\nto being ignored by Slughorn. \\n\\nAfter dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor \\nTower. The common room was very crowded, as most \\npeople had finished dinner by now, but they managed \\nto find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been \\nin a bad mood ever since the encounter with \\nSlughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. \\nHermione reached out for a copy of the Evening \\nPage | 261 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProphet, which somebody had left abandoned on a \\nchair. \\n\\n“Anything new?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Not really ...” Hermione had opened the newspaper \\nand was scanning the inside pages. “Oh, look, your \\ndad’s in here, Ron — he’s all right!” she added \\nquickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. “It just \\nsays he’s been to visit the Malfoys’ house. ‘This \\nsecond search of the Death Eater’s residence does not \\nseem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of \\nthe Office for the Detection and Confiscation of \\nCounterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects \\nsaid that his team had been acting upon a confidential \\ntip-off’” \\n\\n“Yeah, mine!” said Harry. “I told him at King’s Cross \\nabout Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get \\nBorgin to fix! Well, if it’s not at their house, he must \\nhave brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him — ” \\n\\n“But how can he have done, Harry?” said Hermione, \\nputting down the newspaper with a surprised look. \\n“We were all searched when we arrived, weren’t we?” \\n\\n“Were you?” said Harry, taken aback. “I wasn’t!” \\n\\n“Oh no, of course you weren’t, I forgot you were late. \\n\\n... Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors \\nwhen we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object \\nwould have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had \\na shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can’t \\nhave brought in anything dangerous!” \\n\\nMomentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley \\nplaying with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before \\nseeing a way around this objection. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 262 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then,” he said. “His \\nmother or someone.” \\n\\n“All the owls are being checked too,” said Hermione. \\n“Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy \\nSensors everywhere he could reach.” \\n\\nReally stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to \\nsay. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could \\nhave brought a dangerous or Dark object into the \\nschool. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting \\nwith his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown. \\n\\n“Can you think of any way Malfoy — ?” \\n\\n“Oh, drop it, Harry,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione \\nand me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to \\ngo, you know!” said Harry, firing up. \\n\\n“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said Ron, \\ngetting to his feet again, “I think I’ll go to bed.” \\n\\nHe stomped off toward the door to the boys’ \\ndormitories, leaving Harry and Hermione staring after \\nhim. \\n\\n“Harry?” said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, \\nappearing suddenly at his shoulder. “I’ve got a \\nmessage for you.” \\n\\n“From Professor Slughorn?” asked Harry, sitting up \\nhopefully. \\n\\n“No ... from Professor Snape,” said Demelza. Harry’s \\nheart sank. “He says you’re to come to his office at \\nhalf past eight tonight to do your detention — er — no \\nmatter how many party invitations you’ve received. \\n\\nPage | 263 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting out \\nrotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions \\nand — and he says there’s no need to bring protective \\ngloves.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry grimly. “Thanks a lot, Demelza.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 264 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSILVER AND OPALS \\n\\nWhere was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? \\nHarry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over \\nthe next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals \\nanymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in \\nthinking that he was leaving the school for days at a \\ntime. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was \\nsupposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said \\nthat the lessons were leading to something to do with \\nthe prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, \\nand now he felt slightly abandoned. \\n\\nHalfway through October came their first trip of the \\nterm to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether \\nthese trips would still be allowed, given the \\nincreasingly tight security measures around the \\nschool, but was pleased to know that they were going \\nahead; it was always good to get out of the castle \\ngrounds for a few hours. \\n\\nHarry woke early on the morning of the trip, which \\nwas proving stormy, and whiled away the time until \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 265 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nbreakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion- \\nMaking. He did not usually lie in bed reading his \\ntextbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, \\nwas indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was \\nsimply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the \\nHalf-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making \\nhardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored \\nover the book, the more he realized how much was in \\nthere, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on \\npotions that were earning him such a glowing \\nreputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative \\nlittle jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which \\nHarry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and \\nrevisions, that the Prince had invented himself. \\n\\nHarry had already attempted a few of the Prince’s self- \\ninvented spells. There had been a hex that caused \\ntoenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on \\nCrabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); \\na jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth \\n(which he had twice used, to general applause, on an \\nunsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful \\nof all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone \\nnearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy \\nconversations could be held in class without being \\noverheard. The only person who did not find these \\ncharms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a \\nrigidly disapproving expression throughout and \\nrefused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato \\nspell on anyone in the vicinity. \\n\\nSitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so \\nas to examine more closely the scribbled instructions \\nfor a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince \\nsome trouble. There were many crossings-out and \\nalterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the \\npage, the scribble: \\n\\nLevicorpus (nvbl) \\n\\nPage | 266 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the \\nwindows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at \\nthe letters in brackets. Nvbl ... that had to mean \\n“nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able \\nto bring off this particular spell; he was still having \\ndifficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had \\nbeen quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On \\nthe other hand, the Prince had proved a much more \\neffective teacher than Snape so far. \\n\\nPointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it \\nan upward flick and said Levicorpusl inside his head. \\n\\n“ Aaaaaaaargh ! ” \\n\\nThere was a flash of light and the room was full of \\nvoices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a \\nyell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in \\npanic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as \\nthough an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the \\nankle. \\n\\n“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared \\nwith laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the \\nfloor, having fallen out of bed. “Hang on — I’ll let you \\ndown — ” \\n\\nHe groped for the potion book and riffled through it in \\na panic, trying to find the right page; at last he \\nlocated it and deciphered one cramped word \\nunderneath the spell: Praying that this was the \\ncounter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus\\\\ with all his \\nmight. \\n\\nThere was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a \\nheap onto his mattress. \\n\\n“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and \\nSeamus continued to roar with laughter. \\n\\nPage | 267 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Tomorrow,” said Ron in a muffled voice, “I’d rather \\nyou set the alarm clock.” \\n\\nBy the time they had got dressed, padding themselves \\nout with several of Mrs. Weasley’s hand-knitted \\nsweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, \\nRon’s shock had subsided and he had decided that \\nHarry’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in \\nfact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with \\nthe story as they sat down for breakfast. \\n\\n\"... and then there was another flash of light and I \\nlanded on the bed again!” Ron grinned, helping \\nhimself to sausages. \\n\\nHermione had not cracked a smile during this \\nanecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry \\ndisapproval upon Harry. \\n\\n“Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that \\npotion book of yours?” she asked. \\n\\nHarry frowned at her. \\n\\n“Always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you?” \\n“Was it?” \\n\\n“Well ... yeah, it was, but so what?” \\n\\n“So you just decided to try out an unknown, \\nhandwritten incantation and see what would \\nhappen?” \\n\\n“Why does it matter if it’s handwritten?” said Harry, \\npreferring not to answer the rest of the question. \\n\\n“Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic- \\napproved,” said Hermione. “And also,” she added, as \\n\\nPage | 268 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m starting \\nto think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.” \\n\\n\\n\\nBoth Harry and Ron shouted her down at once. \\n\\n“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle \\nover his sausages. “Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s \\nall!” \\n\\n“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said \\nHermione. “Who puts their time and energy into \\nmaking up spells like that?” \\n\\n“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their \\nkind of thing. And, er — ” \\n\\n“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered. \\n\\n“What?” said Ron and Hermione together. \\n\\n“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told \\nme.” \\n\\nThis last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen \\nhis father use the spell on Snape, but he had never \\ntold Ron and Hermione about that particular \\nexcursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a \\nwonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half- \\nBlood Prince possibly be — ? \\n\\n“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, \\n“but he’s not the only one. We’ve seen a whole bunch \\nof people use it, in case you’ve forgotten. Dangling \\npeople in the air. Making them float along, asleep, \\nhelpless.” \\n\\nHarry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too \\nremembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the \\nQuidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid. \\n\\nPage | 269 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That was different,” he said robustly. “They were \\nabusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a \\nlaugh. You don’t like the Prince, Hermione,” he added, \\npointing a sausage at her sternly, “because he’s better \\nthan you at Potions — ” \\n\\n“It’s got nothing to do with that!” said Hermione, her \\ncheeks reddening. “I just think it’s very irresponsible \\nto start performing spells when you don’t even know \\nwhat they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as \\nif it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it \\ndoesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to \\nme!” \\n\\n“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry \\nheatedly. “If he’d been a budding Death Eater he \\nwouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ \\nwould he?” \\n\\nEven as he said it, Harry remembered that his father \\nhad been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out \\nof his mind; he would worry about that later. ... \\n\\n“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t \\nenough pure-blood wizards left,” said Hermione \\nstubbornly. “I expect most of them are half-bloods \\npretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they \\nhate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join \\nup.” \\n\\n“There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said \\nRon indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he \\nwas now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie \\nMacmillan on the head. “My whole family are blood \\ntraitors! That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death \\nEaters!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 270 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And they’d love to have me,” said Harry sarcastically. \\n“We’d be best pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me \\n\\n\\n\\nin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging \\nsmile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny. \\n\\n“Hey, Harry, I’m supposed to give you this.” \\n\\nIt was a scroll of parchment with Harry’s name \\nwritten upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing. \\n\\n“Thanks, Ginny ... It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson!” \\nHarry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the \\nparchment and quickly reading its contents. “Monday \\nevening!” He felt suddenly light and happy. “Want to \\njoin us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?” he asked. \\n\\n“I’m going with Dean — might see you there,” she \\nreplied, waving at them as she left. \\n\\nFilch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, \\nchecking off the names of people who had permission \\nto go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer \\nthan normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody \\nwith his Secrecy Sensor. \\n\\n“What does it matter if we’re smuggling Dark stuff \\nOUT?” demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy \\nSensor with apprehension. “Surely you ought to be \\nchecking what we bring back IN?” \\n\\nHis cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the \\nSensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out \\ninto the wind and sleet. \\n\\nThe walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry \\nwrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed \\npart soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the \\n\\nPage | 271 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvillage was full of students bent double against the \\nbitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether \\nthey might not have had a better time in the warm \\ncommon room, and when they finally reached \\nHogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s Joke Shop had \\nbeen boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that \\nthis trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with \\na thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was \\nmercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered \\nin his wake into the crowded shop. \\n\\n“Thank God,” shivered Ron as they were enveloped by \\nwarm, toffee-scented air. “Let’s stay here all \\nafternoon.” \\n\\n“Harry, m’boy!” said a booming voice from behind \\nthem. \\n\\n“Oh no,” muttered Harry. The three of them turned to \\nsee Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an \\nenormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching \\nfur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized \\npineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the \\nshop. \\n\\n“Harry, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed \\nnow!” said Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. \\n“It won’t do, m’boy, I’m determined to have you! Miss \\nGranger loves them, don’t you?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Hermione helplessly, “they’re really — ” \\n\\n“So why don’t you come along, Harry?” demanded \\nSlughorn. \\n\\n“Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,” said \\nHarry, who had indeed been scheduling practices \\nevery time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet \\nribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant that \\n\\nPage | 272 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon was not left out, and they usually had a laugh \\nwith Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with \\nMcLaggen and Zabini. \\n\\n“Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match \\nafter all this hard work!” said Slughorn. “But a little \\nrecreation never hurt anybody. Now, how about \\nMonday night, you can’t possibly want to practice in \\nthis weather. ...” \\n\\n“I can’t, Professor, I’ve got — er — an appointment \\nwith Professor Dumbledore that evening.” \\n\\n“Unlucky again!” cried Slughorn dramatically. “Ah, \\nwell ... you can’t evade me forever, Harry!” \\n\\nAnd with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, \\ntaking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a \\ndisplay of Cockroach Clusters. \\n\\n“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” \\nsaid Hermione, shaking her head. “They’re not that \\nbad, you know. ... They’re even quite fun sometimes. \\n...” But then she caught sight of Ron’s expression. \\n\\n“Oh, look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those \\nwould last hours!” \\n\\nGlad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry \\nshowed much more interest in the new extra-large \\nsugar quills than he would normally have done, but \\nRon continued to look moody and merely shrugged \\nwhen Hermione asked him where he wanted to go \\nnext. \\n\\n“Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks,” said Harry. “It’ll \\nbe warm.” \\n\\nThey bundled their scarves back over their faces and \\nleft the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on \\n\\nPage | 273 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. \\nThe street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to \\nchat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The \\nexceptions were two men a little ahead of them, \\nstanding just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was \\nvery tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed \\nglasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in \\nthe other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog’s Head. As Harry, \\nRon, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his \\ncloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, \\nleaving the shorter man to fumble with something in \\nhis arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry \\nrealized who the man was. \\n\\n“Mundungus!” \\n\\nThe squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, \\nginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, \\nwhich burst open, releasing what looked like the \\nentire contents of a junk shop window. \\n\\n“Oh, ’ello, ’Arry,” said Mundungus Fletcher, with a \\nmost unconvincing stab at airiness. “Well, don’t let \\nme keep ya.” \\n\\nAnd he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the \\ncontents of his suitcase with every appearance of a \\nman eager to be gone. \\n\\n“Are you selling this stuff?” asked Harry, watching \\nMundungus grab an assortment of grubby-looking \\nobjects from the ground. \\n\\n“Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,” said Mundungus. \\n“Gimme that!” \\n\\nRon had stooped down and picked up something \\nsilver. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 274 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hang on,” Ron said slowly. “This looks familiar — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Thank you!” said Mundungus, snatching the goblet \\nout of Ron’s hand and stuffing it back into the case. \\n“Well, I’ll see you all — OUCH!” \\n\\nHarry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the \\npub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he \\npulled out his wand. \\n\\n“Harry!” squealed Hermione. \\n\\n“You took that from Sirius’s house,” said Harry, who \\nwas almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was \\nbreathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and \\nspirits. “That had the Black family crest on it.” \\n\\n“I — no — what — ?” spluttered Mundungus, who \\nwas slowly turning purple. \\n\\n“What did you do, go back the night he died and strip \\nthe place?” snarled Harry. \\n\\n“I — no — ” \\n\\n“Give it to me!” \\n\\n“Harry, you mustn’t!” shrieked Hermione, as \\nMundungus started to turn blue. \\n\\nThere was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off \\nMundungus’s throat. Gasping and spluttering, \\nMundungus seized his fallen case, then — CRACK — \\nhe Disapparated. \\n\\nHarry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the \\nspot to see where Mundungus had gone. \\n\\n“COME BACK, YOU THIEVING — !” \\n\\nPage | 275 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s no point, Harry.” \\n\\n\\n\\nTonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair \\nwet with sleet. \\n\\n“Mundungus will probably be in London by now. \\nThere’s no point yelling.” \\n\\n“He’s nicked Sirius’s stuff! Nicked it!” \\n\\n“Yes, but still,” said Tonks, who seemed perfectly \\nuntroubled by this piece of information. “You should \\nget out of the cold.” \\n\\nShe watched them go through the door of the Three \\nBroomsticks. \\n\\nThe moment he was inside, Harry burst out, “He was \\nnicking Sirius’s stuff.” \\n\\n“I know, Harry, but please don’t shout, people are \\nstaring,” whispered Hermione. “Go and sit down, I’ll \\nget you a drink.” \\n\\nHarry was still fuming when Hermione returned to \\ntheir table a few minutes later holding three bottles of \\nbutterbeer. \\n\\n“Can’t the Order control Mundungus?” Harry \\ndemanded of the other two in a furious whisper. \\n\\n“Can’t they at least stop him stealing everything that’s \\nnot fixed down when he’s at headquarters?” \\n\\n“Shh!” said Hermione desperately, looking around to \\nmake sure nobody was listening; there were a couple \\nof warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry \\nwith great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a \\npillar not far away. “Harry, I’d be annoyed too, I know \\nit’s your things he’s stealing — ” \\n\\nPage | 276 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily \\nforgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld \\nPlace. \\n\\n“Yeah, it’s my stuff!” he said. “No wonder he wasn’t \\npleased to see me! Well, I’m going to tell Dumbledore \\nwhat’s going on, he’s the only one who scares \\nMundungus.” \\n\\n“Good idea,” whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that \\nHarry was calming down. “Ron, what are you staring \\nat?” \\n\\n“Nothing,” said Ron, hastily looking away from the \\nbar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of \\nthe curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, \\nfor whom he had long nursed a soft spot. \\n\\n“I expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more \\nfirewhisky,” said Hermione waspishly. \\n\\nRon ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he \\nevidently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry \\nwas thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated \\nthose silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her \\nfingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron \\nand the bar. The moment Harry drained the last \\ndrops in his bottle she said, “Shall we call it a day \\nand go back to school, then?” \\n\\nThe other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and \\nthe weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. \\nOnce again they drew their cloaks tightly around \\nthem, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves, \\nthen followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub \\nand back up the High Street. Harry’s thoughts \\nstrayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to \\nHogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met \\nup with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because \\nPage | 277 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshe and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam \\nPuddifoot’s Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. \\nScowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet \\nand trudged on. \\n\\nIt was a little while before Harry became aware that \\nthe voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were \\nbeing carried back to him on the wind, had become \\nshriller and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct \\nfigures. The two girls were having an argument about \\nsomething Katie was holding in her hand. “It’s \\nnothing to do with you, Leanne!” Harry heard Katie \\nsay. \\n\\nThey rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick \\nand fast, blurring Harry’s glasses. Just as he raised a \\ngloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold \\nof the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back \\nand the package fell to the ground. \\n\\nAt once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, \\nsuspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her \\narms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. \\n\\nYet there was something wrong, something eerie. ... \\nHer hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, \\nbut her eyes were closed and her face was quite \\nempty of expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and \\nLeanne had all halted in their tracks, watching. \\n\\nThen, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a \\nterrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she \\ncould see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly \\ncausing her terrible anguish. She screamed and \\nscreamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized \\nKatie’s ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. \\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, \\nbut even as they grabbed Katie’s legs, she fell on top \\nof them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she \\nwas writhing so much they could hardly hold her. \\nPage | 278 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead they lowered her to the ground where she \\nthrashed and screamed, apparently unable to \\nrecognize any of them. \\n\\nHarry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted. \\n\\n“Stay there!” he shouted at the others over the \\nhowling wind. “I’m going for help!” \\n\\nHe began to sprint toward the school; he had never \\nseen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and \\ncould not think what had caused it; he hurtled \\naround a bend in the lane and collided with what \\nseemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs. \\n\\n“Hagrid!” he panted, disentangling himself from the \\nhedgerow into which he had fallen. \\n\\n“Harry!” said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his \\neyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, \\nshaggy beaverskin coat. “Jus’ bin visitin’ Grawp, he’s \\ncornin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ — ” \\n\\n“Hagrid, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or \\nsomething — ” \\n\\n“Wha?” said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what \\nHarry was saying over the raging wind. \\n\\n“Someone’s been cursed!” bellowed Harry. \\n\\n“Cursed? Who’s bin cursed — not Ron? Hermione?” \\n\\n“No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way ...” \\n\\nTogether they ran back along the lane. It took them \\nno time to find the little group of people around Katie, \\nwho was still writhing and screaming on the ground; \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 279 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to quiet \\nher. \\n\\n“Get back!” shouted Hagrid. “Lemme see her!” \\n\\n“Something’s happened to her!” sobbed Leanne. “I \\ndon’t know what — ” \\n\\nHagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a \\nword, bent down, scooped her into his arms, and ran \\noff toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Katie’s \\npiercing screams had died away and the only sound \\nwas the roar of the wind. \\n\\nHermione hurried over to Katie’s wailing friend and \\nput an arm around her. \\n\\n“It’s Leanne, isn’t it?” \\n\\nThe girl nodded. \\n\\n“Did it just happen all of a sudden, or — ?” \\n\\n“It was when that package tore,” sobbed Leanne, \\npointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on \\nthe ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish \\nglitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but \\nHarry seized his arm and pulled him back. \\n\\n“Don’t touch if!” \\n\\nHe crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was \\nvisible, poking out of the paper. \\n\\n“I’ve seen that before,” said Harry, staring at the \\nthing. “It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages \\nago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have \\ntouched it.” He looked up at Leanne, who had started \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 280 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto shake uncontrollably. “How did Katie get hold of \\nthis?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, that’s why we were arguing. She came back \\nfrom the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding \\nit, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts \\nand she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when \\nshe said it. ... Oh no, oh no, I bet she’d been \\nImperiused and I didn’t realize!” \\n\\nLeanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted \\nher shoulder gently. \\n\\n“She didn’t say who’d given it to her, Leanne?” \\n\\n“No ... she wouldn’t tell me ... and I said she was \\nbeing stupid and not to take it up to school, but she \\njust wouldn’t listen and ... and then I tried to grab it \\nfrom her . . . and — and — ” \\n\\nLeanne let out a wail of despair. \\n\\n“We’d better get up to school,” said Hermione, her \\narm still around Leanne. “We’ll be able to find out \\nhow she is. Come on. ...” \\n\\nHarry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf \\nfrom around his face and, ignoring Ron’s gasp, \\ncarefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up. \\n\\n“Well need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,” he said. \\n\\nAs they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, \\nHarry was thinking furiously. They had just entered \\nthe grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his \\nthoughts to himself any longer. \\n\\n“Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at \\nBorgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a \\n\\nPage | 281 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngood look at it while I was hiding from him and his \\ndad. This is what he was buying that day when we \\nfollowed him! He remembered it and he went back for \\nit!” \\n\\n\\n\\n“I — I dunno, Harry,” said Ron hesitantly. “Loads of \\npeople go to Borgin and Burkes ... and didn’t that girl \\nsay Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?” \\n\\n“She said she came back from the bathroom with it, \\nshe didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ” \\n\\n“McGonagall!” said Ron warningly. \\n\\nHarry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall \\nwas hurrying down the stone steps through swirling \\nsleet to meet them. \\n\\n“Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie \\nBell — upstairs to my office at once, please! What’s \\nthat you’re holding, Potter?” \\n\\n“It’s the thing she touched,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Good lord,” said Professor McGonagall, looking \\nalarmed as she took the necklace from Harry. “No, no, \\nFilch, they’re with me!” she added hastily, as Filch \\ncame shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall \\nholding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. “Take this necklace \\nto Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch \\nit, keep it wrapped in the scarf!” \\n\\nHarry and the others followed Professor McGonagall \\nupstairs and into her office. The sleet-spattered \\nwindows were rattling in their frames, and the room \\nwas chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. \\nProfessor McGonagall closed the door and swept \\naround her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and \\nthe still sobbing Leanne. \\n\\nPage | 282 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?” she said sharply. “What happened?” \\n\\n\\n\\nHaltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted \\nto control her crying, Leanne told Professor \\nMcGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in \\nthe Three Broomsticks and returned holding the \\nunmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little \\nodd, and how they had argued about the advisability \\nof agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument \\nculminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore \\nopen. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there \\nwas no getting another word out of her. \\n\\n“All right,” said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, \\n“go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get \\nMadam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.” \\n\\nWhen she had left the room, Professor McGonagall \\nturned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \\n\\n“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?” \\n\\n“She rose up in the air,” said Harry, before either Ron \\nor Hermione could speak, “and then began to scream, \\nand collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor \\nDumbledore, please?” \\n\\n“The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,” said \\nProfessor McGonagall, looking surprised. \\n\\n“Away?” Harry repeated angrily. \\n\\n“Yes, Potter, away!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. \\n“But anything you have to say about this horrible \\nbusiness can be said to me, I’m sure!” \\n\\nFor a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor \\nMcGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, \\nthough in many ways more intimidating, still seemed \\n\\nPage | 283 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nless likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a \\nlife-and-death matter, though, and no moment to \\nworry about being laughed at. \\n\\n“I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, \\nProfessor.” \\n\\nOn one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent \\nembarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her \\nfeet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance \\nbetween herself and Harry. \\n\\n“That is a very serious accusation, Potter,” said \\nProfessor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. “Do you \\nhave any proof?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry, “but ...” and he told her about \\nfollowing Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the \\nconversation they had overheard between him and \\nMr. Borgin. \\n\\nWhen he had finished speaking, Professor \\nMcGonagall looked slightly confused. \\n\\n“Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for \\nrepair?” \\n\\n“No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how \\nto mend something, he didn’t have it with him. But \\nthat’s not the point, the thing is that he bought \\nsomething at the same time, and I think it was that \\nnecklace — ” \\n\\n“You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar \\npackage?” \\n\\n“No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop \\nfor him — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 284 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But Harry,” Hermione interrupted, “Borgin asked \\nhim if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said \\n\\n\\n\\nno — \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!” said \\nHarry angrily. \\n\\n“What he actually said was, ‘How would I look \\ncarrying that down the street?’ ” said Hermione. \\n\\n“Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a \\nnecklace,” interjected Ron. \\n\\n“Oh, Ron,” said Hermione despairingly, “it would be \\nall wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and \\nquite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see \\nit! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes \\nwas noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw \\nattention to him if he carried it down the street — and \\nin any case,” she pressed on loudly, before Harry \\ncould interrupt, “I asked Borgin about the necklace, \\ndon’t you remember? When I went in to try and find \\nout what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it \\nthere. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn’t say \\nit was already sold or anything — ” \\n\\n“Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what \\nyou were up to within about five seconds, of course \\nhe wasn’t going to tell you — anyway, Malfoy could’ve \\nsent off for it since — ” \\n\\n“That’s enough!” said Professor McGonagall, as \\nHermione opened her mouth to retort, looking \\nfurious. “Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but \\nwe cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy \\npurely because he visited the shop where this \\nnecklace might have been purchased. The same is \\nprobably true of hundreds of people — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 285 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ — that’s what I said — ” muttered Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\n“ — and in any case, we have put stringent security \\nmeasures in place this year. I do not believe that \\nnecklace can possibly have entered this school \\nwithout our knowledge — ” \\n\\n“But — ” \\n\\n“ — and what is more,” said Professor McGonagall, \\nwith an air of awful finality, “Mr. Malfoy was not in \\nHogsmeade today.” \\n\\nHarry gaped at her, deflating. \\n\\n“How do you know, Professor?” \\n\\n“Because he was doing detention with me. He has \\nnow failed to complete his Transfiguration homework \\ntwice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your \\nsuspicions, Potter,” she said as she marched past \\nthem, “but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to \\ncheck on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.” \\n\\nShe held open her office door. They had no choice but \\nto file past her without another word. \\n\\nHarry was angry with the other two for siding with \\nMcGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in \\nonce they started discussing what had happened. \\n\\n“So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the \\nnecklace to?” asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to \\nthe common room. \\n\\n“Goodness only knows,” said Hermione. “But whoever \\nit was has had a narrow escape. No one could have \\nopened that package without touching the necklace.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 286 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It could’ve been meant for loads of people,” said \\nHarry. “Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to \\nget rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or \\nSlughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really \\nwanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided \\nwith Dumbledore. Or — ” \\n\\n“Or you,” said Hermione, looking troubled. \\n\\n“Couldn’t have been,” said Harry, “or Katie would’ve \\njust turned around in the lane and given it to me, \\nwouldn’t she? I was behind her all the way out of the \\nThree Broomsticks. It would have made much more \\nsense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what \\nwith Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I \\nwonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?” \\n\\n“Harry, Malfoy wasn’t in Hogsmeade!” said Hermione, \\nactually stamping her foot in frustration. \\n\\n“He must have used an accomplice, then,” said Harry. \\n“Crabbe or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another \\nDeath Eater, he’ll have loads better cronies than \\nCrabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up — ” \\n\\nRon and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said \\nThere’s no point arguing with him. \\n\\n“Dilligrout,” said Hermione firmly as they reached the \\nFat Lady. \\n\\nThe portrait swung open to admit them to the \\ncommon room. It was quite full and smelled of damp \\nclothing; many people seemed to have returned from \\nHogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There \\nwas no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, \\nthe news of Katie’s fate had not yet spread. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 287 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop \\nand think about it,” said Ron, casually turfing a first \\nyear out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so \\nthat he could sit down. “The curse didn’t even make it \\ninto the castle. Not what you’d call foolproof.” \\n\\n“You’re right,” said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the \\nchair with her foot and offering it to the first year \\nagain. “It wasn’t very well thought-out at all.” \\n\\n“But since when has Malfoy been one of the world’s \\ngreat thinkers?” asked Harry. \\n\\nNeither Ron nor Hermione answered him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 288 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SECRET RIDDLE \\n\\nKatie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for \\nMagical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by \\nwhich time the news that she had been cursed had \\nspread all over the school, though the details were \\nconfused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, \\nHermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie \\nherself had not been the intended target. \\n\\n“Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course,” said Harry to Ron \\nand Hermione, who continued their new policy of \\nfeigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his \\nMalfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory. \\n\\nHarry had wondered whether Dumbledore would \\nreturn from wherever he had been in time for Monday \\nnight’s lesson, but having had no word to the \\ncontrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore ’s \\noffice at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter. \\nThere sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his \\nhand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled \\nwhen he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 289 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nwas sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks \\nof light over the ceiling. \\n\\n\\n\\n“You have had a busy time while I have been away,” \\nDumbledore said. “I believe you witnessed Katie’s \\naccident.” \\n\\n“Yes, sir. How is she?” \\n\\n“Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. \\nShe appears to have brushed the necklace with the \\nsmallest possible amount of skin: There was a tiny \\nhole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even \\nheld it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, \\nperhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able \\nto do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse — \\n\\n\\n\\n“Why him?” asked Harry quickly. “Why not Madam \\nPomfrey?” \\n\\n“Impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the \\nportraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, \\nSirius’s great-great-grandfather, raised his head from \\nhis arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. “I \\nwould not have permitted a student to question the \\nway Hogwarts operated in my day.” \\n\\n“Yes, thank you, Phineas,” said Dumbledore \\nquellingly. “Professor Snape knows much more about \\nthe Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, \\nthe St. Mungo’s staff are sending me hourly reports, \\nand I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery \\nin time.” \\n\\n“Where were you this weekend, sir?” Harry asked, \\ndisregarding a strong feeling that he might be \\npushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by \\nPhineas Nigellus, who hissed softly. \\n\\nPage | 290 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I would rather not say just now,” said Dumbledore. \\n“However, I shall tell you in due course.” \\n\\n“You will?” said Harry, startled. \\n\\n“Yes, I expect so,” said Dumbledore, withdrawing a \\nfresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes \\nand uncorking it with a prod of his wand. \\n\\n“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “I met Mundungus in \\nHogsmeade.” \\n\\n“Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has \\nbeen treating your inheritance with light-fingered \\ncontempt,” said Dumbledore, frowning a little. “He \\nhas gone to ground since you accosted him outside \\nthe Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads \\nfacing me. However, rest assured that he will not be \\nmaking away with any more of Sirius’s old \\npossessions.” \\n\\n“That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black \\nheirlooms?” said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he \\nstalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his \\nportrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place. \\n\\n“Professor,” said Harry, after a short pause, “did \\nProfessor McGonagall tell you what I told her after \\nKatie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?” \\n\\n“She told me of your suspicions, yes,” said \\nDumbledore. \\n\\n“And do you — ?” \\n\\n“I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate \\nanyone who might have had a hand in Katie’s \\naccident,” said Dumbledore. “But what concerns me \\nnow, Harry, is our lesson.” \\n\\nPage | 291 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons \\nwere so very important, why had there been such a \\nlong gap between the first and second? However, he \\nsaid no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as \\nDumbledore poured the fresh memories into the \\nPensieve and began swirling the stone basin once \\nmore between his long-fingered hands. \\n\\n“You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of \\nLord Voldemort’s beginnings at the point where the \\nhandsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his \\nwitch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home \\nin Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, \\nexpecting the baby who would one day become Lord \\nVoldemort.” \\n\\n“How do you know she was in London, sir?” \\n\\n“Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,” \\nsaid Dumbledore, “who, by an odd coincidence, \\nhelped found the very shop whence came the \\nnecklace we have just been discussing.” \\n\\nHe swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had \\nseen him swill them before, much as a gold \\nprospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery \\nmass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the \\nPensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with \\na thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes. \\n\\n“Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was \\nbrought in by a young witch just before Christmas, \\noh, many years ago now. She said she needed the \\ngold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in \\nrags and pretty far along ... Going to have a baby, see. \\nShe said the locket had been Slytherin’s. Well, we \\nhear that sort of story all the time, ‘Oh, this was \\nMerlin’s, this was, his favorite teapot,’ but when I \\nlooked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few \\nPage | 292 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsimple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of \\ncourse, that made it near enough priceless. She didn’t \\nseem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy \\nto get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!” \\n\\nDumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous \\nshake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the \\nswirling mass of memory from whence he had come. \\n\\n“He only gave her ten Galleons?” said Harry \\nindignantly. \\n\\n“Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. “So we know that, near the end of \\nher pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in \\ndesperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her \\none and only valuable possession, the locket that was \\none of Marvolo’s treasured family heirlooms.” \\n\\n“But she could do magic!” said Harry impatiently. \\n\\n“She could have got food and everything for herself by \\nmagic, couldn’t she?” \\n\\n“Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could. But it is \\nmy belief — I am guessing again, but I am sure I am \\nright — that when her husband abandoned her, \\nMerope stopped using magic. I do not think that she \\nwanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also \\npossible that her unrequited love and the attendant \\ndespair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. \\n\\nIn any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused \\nto raise her wand even to save her own life.” \\n\\n“She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?” \\n\\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. “Could you possibly \\nbe feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 293 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” said Harry quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t \\nshe, not like my mother — ” \\n\\n“Your mother had a choice too,” said Dumbledore \\ngently. “Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a \\nson who needed her, but do not judge her too \\nharshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long \\nsuffering and she never had your mother’s courage. \\nAnd now, if you will stand ...” \\n\\n“Where are we going?” Harry asked, as Dumbledore \\njoined him at the front of the desk. \\n\\n“This time,” said Dumbledore, “we are going to enter \\nmy memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail \\nand satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry ...” \\n\\nHarry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool \\nsurface of the memory and then he was falling \\nthrough darkness again. ... Seconds later, his feet hit \\nfirm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he \\nand Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old- \\nfashioned London street. \\n\\n“There I am,” said Dumbledore brightly, pointing \\nahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in \\nfront of a horse-drawn milk cart. \\n\\nThis younger Albus Dumbledore ’s long hair and beard \\nwere auburn. Having reached their side of the street, \\nhe strode off along the pavement, drawing many \\ncurious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of \\nplum velvet that he was wearing. \\n\\n“Nice suit, sir,” said Harry, before he could stop \\nhimself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they \\nfollowed his younger self a short distance, finally \\npassing through a set of iron gates into a bare \\ncourtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building \\nPage | 294 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsurrounded by high railings. He mounted the few \\nsteps leading to the front door and knocked once. \\nAfter a moment or two, the door was opened by a \\nscruffy girl wearing an apron. \\n\\n“Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. \\nCole, who, I believe, is the matron here?” \\n\\n“Oh,” said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in \\nDumbledore ’s eccentric appearance. “Um ... just a \\nmo’ ... MRS. COLE!” she bellowed over her shoulder. \\n\\nHarry heard a distant voice shouting something in \\nresponse. The girl turned back to Dumbledore. “Come \\nin, she’s on ’er way.” \\n\\nDumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and \\nwhite; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly \\nclean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. \\nBefore the front door had closed behind them, a \\nskinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying \\ntoward them. She had a sharp-featured face that \\nappeared more anxious than unkind, and she was \\ntalking over her shoulder to another aproned helper \\nas she walked toward Dumbledore. \\n\\n\"... and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy \\nStubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley’s \\noozing all over his sheets — chicken pox on top of \\neverything else,” she said to nobody in particular, and \\nthen her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped \\ndead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a \\ngiraffe had just crossed her threshold. \\n\\n“Good afternoon,” said Dumbledore, holding out his \\nhand. \\n\\nMrs. Cole simply gaped. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 295 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter \\nrequesting an appointment and you very kindly \\ninvited me here today.” \\n\\nMrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that \\nDumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, \\n“Oh yes. Well — well then — you’d better come into \\nmy room. Yes.” \\n\\nShe led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed \\npart sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the \\nhallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. \\nShe invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and \\nseated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him \\nnervously. \\n\\n“I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom \\nRiddle and arrangements for his future,” said \\nDumbledore. \\n\\n“Are you family?” asked Mrs. Cole. \\n\\n“No, I am a teacher,” said Dumbledore. “I have come \\nto offer Tom a place at my school.” \\n\\n“What school’s this, then?” \\n\\n“It is called Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“And how come you’re interested in Tom?” \\n\\n“We believe he has qualities we are looking for.” \\n\\n“You mean he’s won a scholarship? How can he have \\ndone? He’s never been entered for one.” \\n\\n“Well, his name has been down for our school since \\nbirth — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 296 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who registered him? His parents?” \\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an \\ninconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Dumbledore \\nthought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand \\nout of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time \\npicking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. \\nCole’s desktop. \\n\\n“Here,” said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he \\npassed her the piece of paper, “I think this will make \\neverything clear.” \\n\\nMrs. Cole’s eyes slid out of focus and back again as \\nshe gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment. \\n\\n“That seems perfectly in order,” she said placidly, \\nhanding it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of \\ngin and two glasses that had certainly not been \\npresent a few seconds before. \\n\\n“Er — may I offer you a glass of gin?” she said in an \\nextra-refined voice. \\n\\n“Thank you very much,” said Dumbledore, beaming. \\n\\nIt soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice \\nwhen it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a \\ngenerous measure, she drained her own glass in one \\ngulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at \\nDumbledore for the first time, and he didn’t hesitate \\nto press his advantage. \\n\\n“I was wondering whether you could tell me anything \\nof Tom Riddle’s history? I think he was born here in \\nthe orphanage?” \\n\\n“That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more \\ngin. “I remember it clear as anything, because I’d just \\n\\nPage | 297 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstarted here myself. New Year’s Eve and bitter cold, \\nsnowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not \\nmuch older than I was myself at the time, came \\nstaggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn’t the \\nfirst. We took her in, and she had the baby within the \\nhour. And she was dead in another hour.” \\n\\nMrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another \\ngenerous gulp of gin. \\n\\n“Did she say anything before she died?” asked \\nDumbledore. “Anything about the boy’s father, for \\ninstance?” \\n\\n“Now, as it happens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who \\nseemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin \\nin her hand and an eager audience for her story. “I \\nremember she said to me, ‘I hope he looks like his \\npapa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, \\nbecause she was no beauty — and then she told me \\nhe was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, \\nfor her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn’t it? We \\nwondered whether she came from a circus — and she \\nsaid the boy’s surname was to be Riddle. And she \\ndied soon after that without another word. \\n\\n“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so \\nimportant to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo \\nnor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor \\nany family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and \\nhe’s been here ever since.” \\n\\nMrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to \\nanother healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had \\nappeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, \\n“He’s a funny boy.” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I thought he might be.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 298 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you \\nknow. And then, when he got a little older, he was . . . \\nodd.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Odd in what way?” asked Dumbledore gently. \\n\\n“Well, he — ” \\n\\nBut Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing \\nblurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she \\nshot Dumbledore over her gin glass. \\n\\n“He’s definitely got a place at your school, you say?” \\n\\n“Definitely,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“And nothing I say can change that?” \\n\\n“Nothing,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“You’ll be taking him away, whatever?” \\n\\n“Whatever,” repeated Dumbledore gravely. \\n\\nShe squinted at him as though deciding whether or \\nnot to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, \\nbecause she said in a sudden rush, “He scares the \\nother children.” \\n\\n“You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore. \\n\\n“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning \\nslightly, “but it’s very hard to catch him at it. There \\nhave been incidents. ... Nasty things ...” \\n\\nDumbledore did not press her, though Harry could \\ntell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp \\nof gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still. \\n\\nPage | 299 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Billy Stubbs’s rabbit ... well, Tom said he didn’t do it \\nand I don’t see how he could have done, but even so, \\nit didn’t hang itself from the rafters, did it?” \\n\\n“I shouldn’t think so, no,” said Dumbledore quietly. \\n\\n“But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do \\nit. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day \\nbefore. And then” — Mrs. Cole took another swig of \\ngin, slopping a little over her chin this time — “on the \\nsummer outing — we take them out, you know, once \\na year, to the countryside or to the seaside — well, \\nAmy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite \\nright afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was \\nthat they’d gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He \\nswore they’d just gone exploring, but something \\nhappened in there, I’m sure of it. And, well, there \\nhave been a lot of things, funny things. ...” \\n\\nShe looked around at Dumbledore again, and though \\nher cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. “I don’t \\nthink many people will be sorry to see the back of \\nhim.” \\n\\n“You understand, I’m sure, that we will not be \\nkeeping him permanently?” said Dumbledore. “He will \\nhave to return here, at the very least, every summer.” \\n\\n“Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with \\na rusty poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. \\n\\nShe got to her feet, and Harry was impressed to see \\nthat she was quite steady, even though two-thirds of \\nthe gin was now gone. “I suppose you’d like to see \\nhim?” \\n\\n“Very much,” said Dumbledore, rising too. \\n\\nShe led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, \\ncalling out instructions and admonitions to helpers \\n\\nPage | 300 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand children as she passed. The orphans, Harry saw, \\nwere all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic. They \\nlooked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no \\ndenying that this was a grim place in which to grow \\nup. \\n\\n“Here we are,” said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the \\nsecond landing and stopped outside the first door in a \\nlong corridor. She knocked twice and entered. \\n\\n“Tom? You’ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton — \\nsorry, Dunderbore. He’s come to tell you — well, I’ll \\nlet him do it.” \\n\\nHarry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, \\nand Mrs. Cole closed the door on them. It was a small \\nbare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe, \\na wooden chair, and an iron bedstead. A boy was \\nsitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched \\nout in front of him, holding a book. \\n\\nThere was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle’s \\nface. Merope had got her dying wish: He was his \\nhandsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years \\nold, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly \\nas he took in Dumbledore’s eccentric appearance. \\nThere was a moment’s silence. \\n\\n“How do you do, Tom?” said Dumbledore, walking \\nforward and holding out his hand. \\n\\nThe boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook \\nhands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair \\nbeside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather \\nlike a hospital patient and visitor. \\n\\n“I am Professor Dumbledore.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 301 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ ‘Professor?” repeated Riddle. He looked wary. “Is \\nthat like ‘doctor? What are you here for? Did she get \\nyou in to have a look at me?” \\n\\nHe was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole \\nhad just left. \\n\\n“No, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling. \\n\\n“I don’t believe you,” said Riddle. “She wants me \\nlooked at, doesn’t she? Tell the truth!” \\n\\nHe spoke the last three words with a ringing force \\nthat was almost shocking. It was a command, and it \\nsounded as though he had given it many times \\nbefore. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at \\nDumbledore, who made no response except to \\ncontinue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds \\nRiddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, \\nwarier still. \\n\\n“Who are you?” \\n\\n“I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore \\nand I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come \\nto offer you a place at my school — your new school, \\nif you would like to come.” \\n\\nRiddle’s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt \\nfrom the bed and backed away from Dumbledore, \\nlooking furious. \\n\\n“You can’t kid me! The asylum, that’s where you’re \\nfrom, isn’t it? ‘Professor,’ yes, of course — well, I’m \\nnot going, see? That old cat’s the one who should be \\nin the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy \\nBenson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, \\nthey’ll tell you!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 302 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am not from the asylum,” said Dumbledore \\npatiently. “I am a teacher and, if you will sit down \\ncalmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if \\nyou would rather not come to the school, nobody will \\nforce you — ” \\n\\n“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Riddle. \\n\\n“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had \\nnot heard Riddle’s last words, “is a school for people \\nwith special abilities — ” \\n\\n“I’m not mad!” \\n\\n“I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a \\nschool for mad people. It is a school of magic.” \\n\\nThere was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face \\nexpressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and \\nforth between each of Dumbledore’s, as though trying \\nto catch one of them lying. \\n\\n“Magic?” he repeated in a whisper. \\n\\n“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“It’s ... it’s magic, what I can do?” \\n\\n“What is it that you can do?” \\n\\n“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was \\nrising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked \\nfevered. “I can make things move without touching \\nthem. I can make animals do what I want them to do, \\nwithout training them. I can make bad things happen \\nto people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I \\nwant to.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 303 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHis legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat \\ndown on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head \\nbowed as though in prayer. \\n\\n“I knew I was different,” he whispered to his own \\nquivering fingers. “I knew I was special. Always, I \\nknew there was something.” \\n\\n“Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, who \\nwas no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. \\n“You are a wizard.” \\n\\nRiddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: \\n\\nThere was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some \\nreason it did not make him better looking; on the \\ncontrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow \\nrougher, his expression almost bestial. \\n\\n“Are you a wizard too?” \\n\\n“Yes, I am.” \\n\\n“Prove it,” said Riddle at once, in the same \\ncommanding tone he had used when he had said, \\n\\n“Tell the truth.” \\n\\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. “If, as I take it, you \\nare accepting your place at Hogwarts — ” \\n\\n“Of course I am!” \\n\\n“Then you will address me as ‘Professor’ or ‘sir.’ ” \\n\\nRiddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting \\nmoment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite \\nvoice, “I’m sorry, sir. I meant — please, Professor, \\ncould you show me — ?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 304 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, \\nthat he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time \\nfor practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they \\nwere currently in a building full of Muggles and must \\ntherefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, \\nDumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of \\nhis suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in \\nthe corner, and gave the wand a casual flick. \\n\\nThe wardrobe burst into flames. \\n\\nRiddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame \\nhim for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly \\npossessions must be in there. But even as Riddle \\nrounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving \\nthe wardrobe completely undamaged. \\n\\nRiddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, \\nhis expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. \\n\\n“Where can I get one of them?” \\n\\n“All in good time,” said Dumbledore. “I think there is \\nsomething trying to get out of your wardrobe.” \\n\\nAnd sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from \\ninside it. For the first time, Riddle looked frightened. \\n\\n“Open the door,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\nRiddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw \\nopen the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above \\na rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box \\nwas shaking and rattling as though there were several \\nfrantic mice trapped inside it. \\n\\n“Take it out,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\nRiddle took down the quaking box. He looked \\nunnerved. \\n\\nPage | 305 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to \\nhave?” asked Dumbledore. \\n\\nRiddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating \\nlook. “Yes, I suppose so, sir,” he said finally, in an \\nexpressionless voice. \\n\\n“Open it,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\nRiddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto \\nhis bed without looking at them. Harry, who had \\nexpected something much more exciting, saw a mess \\nof small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a silver thimble, \\nand a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free \\nof the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still \\nupon the thin blankets. \\n\\n“You will return them to their owners with your \\napologies,” said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand \\nback into his jacket. “I shall know whether it has \\nbeen done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated \\nat Hogwarts.” \\n\\nRiddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still \\nstaring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last \\nhe said in a colorless voice, “Yes, sir.” \\n\\n“At Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, “we teach you \\nnot only to use magic, but to control it. You have — \\ninadvertently, I am sure — been using your powers in \\na way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our \\nschool. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, \\nto allow your magic to run away with you. But you \\nshould know that Hogwarts can expel students, and \\nthe Ministry of Magic — yes, there is a Ministry — will \\npunish lawbreakers still more severely. All new \\nwizards must accept that, in entering our world, they \\nabide by our laws.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 306 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Riddle again. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his \\nface remained quite blank as he put the little cache of \\nstolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he \\nhad finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said \\nbaldly, “I haven’t got any money.” \\n\\n“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a \\nleather money-pouch from his pocket. “There is a \\nfund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to \\nbuy books and robes. You might have to buy some of \\nyour spellbooks and so on secondhand, but — ” \\n\\n“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, \\nwho had taken the heavy money bag without \\nthanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat \\ngold Galleon. \\n\\n“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list \\nof books and school equipment with me. I can help \\nyou find everything — ” \\n\\n“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up. \\n“Certainly, if you — ” \\n\\n“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing \\nthings for myself, I go round London on my own all \\nthe time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley — sir?” \\nhe added, catching Dumbledore ’s eye. \\n\\nHarry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon \\naccompanying Riddle, but once again he was \\nsurprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope \\ncontaining his list of equipment, and after telling \\nRiddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from \\nthe orphanage, he said, “You will be able to see it, \\nalthough Muggles around you — non-magical people, \\nPage | 307 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat is — will not. Ask for Tom the barman — easy \\nenough to remember, as he shares your name — ” \\n\\nRiddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to \\ndisplace an irksome fly. \\n\\n“You dislike the name Tom’?” \\n\\n“There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle. Then, as \\nthough he could not suppress the question, as \\nthough it burst from him in spite of himself, he \\nasked, “Was my father a wizard? He was called Tom \\nRiddle too, they’ve told me.” \\n\\n“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dumbledore, his voice \\ngentle. \\n\\n“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t \\nhave died,” said Riddle, more to himself than \\nDumbledore. “It must’ve been him. So — when I’ve got \\nall my stuff — when do I come to this Hogwarts?” \\n\\n“All the details are on the second piece of parchment \\nin your envelope,” said Dumbledore. “You will leave \\nfrom King’s Cross Station on the first of September. \\nThere is a train ticket in there too.” \\n\\nRiddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held \\nout his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, “I can \\nspeak to snakes. I found out when we’ve been to the \\ncountry on trips — they find me, they whisper to me. \\nIs that normal for a wizard?” \\n\\nHarry could tell that he had withheld mention of this \\nstrangest power until that moment, determined to \\nimpress. \\n\\n“It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s \\nhesitation, “but not unheard of.” \\n\\nPage | 308 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHis tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously \\nover Riddle’s face. They stood for a moment, man and \\nboy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was \\nbroken; Dumbledore was at the door. \\n\\n“Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.” \\n\\n“I think that will do,” said the white-haired \\nDumbledore at Harry’s side, and seconds later, they \\nwere soaring weightlessly through darkness once \\nmore, before landing squarely in the present-day \\noffice. \\n\\n“Sit down,” said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry. \\n\\nHarry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just \\nseen. \\n\\n“He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, \\nwhen you told him he was a wizard,” said Harry. “I \\ndidn’t believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.” \\n\\n“Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was \\n— to use his word — ‘special,’ ” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Did you know — then?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous \\nDark wizard of all time?” said Dumbledore. “No, I had \\nno idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. \\nHowever, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned \\nto Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, \\nsomething I should have done in any case, given that \\nhe was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt \\nI ought to do for others’ sake as much as his. \\n\\n“His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well- \\ndeveloped for such a young wizard and — most \\ninterestingly and ominously of all — he had already \\n\\nPage | 309 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndiscovered that he had some measure of control over \\nthem, and begun to use them consciously. And as \\nyou saw, they were not the random experiments \\ntypical of young wizards: He was already using magic \\nagainst other people, to frighten, to punish, to \\ncontrol. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and \\nthe young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most \\nsuggestive. ... ‘I can make them hurt if I want to. ...”’ \\n\\n“And he was a Parselmouth,” interjected Harry. \\n\\n“Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly \\nconnected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, \\nthere are Parselmouths among the great and the good \\ntoo. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not \\nmake me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for \\ncruelty, secrecy, and domination. \\n\\n“Time is making fools of us again,” said Dumbledore, \\nindicating the dark sky beyond the windows. “But \\nbefore we part, I want to draw your attention to \\ncertain features of the scene we have just witnessed, \\nfor they have a great bearing on the matters we shall \\nbe discussing in future meetings. \\n\\n“Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I \\nmentioned that another shared his first name, Tom’?” \\n\\nHarry nodded. \\n\\n“There he showed his contempt for anything that tied \\nhim to other people, anything that made him \\nordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, \\nseparate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, \\nwithin a few short years of that conversation and \\ncreated the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort’ behind which he \\nhas been hidden for so long. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 310 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was \\nalready highly self-sufficient, secretive, and, \\napparently, friendless? He did not want help or \\ncompanionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He \\npreferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the \\nsame. You will hear many of his Death Eaters \\nclaiming that they are in his confidence, that they \\nalone are close to him, even understand him. They \\nare deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, \\nnor do I believe that he has ever wanted one. \\n\\n“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay \\nattention to this, Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked \\nto collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles \\nhe had hidden in his room. These were taken from \\nvictims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, \\nof particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind \\nthis magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will \\nbe important later. \\n\\n“And now, it really is time for bed.” \\n\\nHarry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, \\nhis eyes fell upon the little table on which Marvolo \\nGaunt’s ring had rested last time, but the ring was no \\nlonger there. \\n\\n“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to \\na halt. \\n\\n“The ring’s gone,” said Harry, looking around. “But I \\nthought you might have the mouth organ or \\nsomething.” \\n\\nDumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of \\nhis half-moon spectacles. \\n\\n“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only \\never a mouth organ.” \\n\\nPage | 311 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who \\nunderstood himself to be dismissed. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 312 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFELIX FELICIS \\n\\nHarry had Herbology first thing the following \\nmorning. He had been unable to tell Ron and \\nHermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over \\nbreakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled \\nthem in as they walked across the vegetable patch \\ntoward the greenhouses. The weekend’s brutal wind \\nhad died out at last; the weird mist had returned and \\nit took them a little longer than usual to find the \\ncorrect greenhouse. \\n\\n“Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,” said \\nRon quietly, as they took their places around one of \\nthe gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this term’s \\nproject, and began pulling on their protective gloves. \\n“But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing you \\nall this. I mean, it’s really interesting and everything, \\nbut what’s the point?” \\n\\n“Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield. “But he \\nsays it’s all important and it’ll help me survive.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 313 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“I think it’s fascinating,” said Hermione earnestly. “It \\nmakes absolute sense to know as much about \\nVoldemort as possible. How else will you find out his \\nweaknesses?” \\n\\n“So how was Slughorn’s latest party?” Harry asked \\nher thickly through the gum shield. \\n\\n“Oh, it was quite fun, really,” said Hermione, now \\nputting on protective goggles. “I mean, he drones on \\nabout famous ex-pupils a bit, and he absolutely \\nfawns on McLaggen because he’s so well-connected, \\nbut he gave us some really nice food and he \\nintroduced us to Gwenog Jones.” \\n\\n“Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under \\nhis own goggles. “The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the \\nHolyhead Harpies?” \\n\\n“That’s right,” said Hermione. “Personally, I thought \\nshe was a bit full of herself, but — ” \\n\\n“Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout \\nbriskly, bustling over and looking stern. “You’re \\nlagging behind, everybody else has started, and \\nNeville’s already got his first pod!” \\n\\nThey looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville \\nwith a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along \\nthe side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly \\npulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit. \\n\\n“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said Ron, \\nadding quietly, when she had turned away again, \\n“should’ve used Muffliato, Harry.” \\n\\n“No, we shouldn’t!” said Hermione at once, looking, as \\nshe always did, intensely cross at the thought of the \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 314 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHalf-Blood Prince and his spells. “Well, come on ... \\nwe’d better get going. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nShe gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all \\ntook deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled \\nstump between them. \\n\\nIt sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike \\nvines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. \\nOne tangled itself in Hermione’s hair, and Ron beat it \\nback with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in \\ntrapping a couple of vines and knotting them \\ntogether; a hole opened in the middle of all the \\ntentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm \\nbravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around \\nher elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at \\nthe vines, forcing the hole to open again, and \\nHermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her \\nfingers a pod just like Neville’s. At once, the prickly \\nvines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat \\nthere looking like an innocently dead lump of wood. \\n\\n“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in \\nmy garden when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron, \\npushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping \\nsweat from his face. \\n\\n“Pass me a bowl,” said Hermione, holding the \\npulsating pod at arm’s length; Harry handed one over \\nand she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust \\non her face. \\n\\n“Don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best \\nwhen they’re fresh!” called Professor Sprout. \\n\\n“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing their \\ninterrupted conversation as though a lump of wood \\nhad not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have \\na Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no way you’ll be \\n\\nPage | 315 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nable to wriggle out of this one because he actually \\nasked me to check your free evenings, so he could be \\nsure to have it on a night you can come.” \\n\\nHarry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting \\nto burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on \\nit, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, \\nsaid angrily, “And this is another party just for \\nSlughorn’s favorites, is it?” \\n\\n“Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said Hermione. \\n\\nThe pod flew out from under Ron’s fingers and hit the \\ngreenhouse glass, rebounding onto the back of \\nProfessor Sprout’s head and knocking off her old, \\npatched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he \\ngot back, Hermione was saying, “Look, / didn’t make \\nup the name ‘Slug Club’ — ” \\n\\n“ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of \\nMalfoy. “It’s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your \\nparty. Why don’t you try hooking up with McLaggen, \\nthen Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug — \\n\\n\\n\\n“We’re allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who \\nfor some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, \\n“and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think \\nit’s that stupid then I won’t bother!” \\n\\nHarry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little \\nfarther, so that he need not have been sitting here \\nwith the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized \\nthe bowl that contained the pod and began to try and \\nopen it by the noisiest and most energetic means he \\ncould think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every \\nword of their conversation. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 316 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a \\ncompletely different voice. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you’d \\nrather I hooked up with McLaggen ...” \\n\\nThere was a pause while Harry continued to pound \\nthe resilient pod with a trowel. \\n\\n“No, I wouldn’t,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice. \\n\\nHarry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it. \\n\\n“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his \\nwand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The \\ncrash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and \\nHermione to Harry’s presence. Hermione looked \\nflustered and immediately started fussing about for \\nher copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out \\nthe correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the \\nother hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased \\nwith himself. \\n\\n“Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It \\nsays we’re supposed to puncture them with \\nsomething sharp. ...” \\n\\nHarry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron \\nboth snapped their goggles back over their eyes and \\ndived, once more, for the stump. \\n\\nIt was not as though he was really surprised, thought \\nHarry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon \\nthrottling him; he had had an inkling that this might \\nhappen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he \\nfelt about it. ... He and Cho were now too \\nembarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to \\neach other; what if Ron and Hermione started going \\nout together, then split up? Could their friendship \\nPage | 317 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsurvive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when \\nthey had not been talking to each other in the third \\nyear; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance \\nbetween them. And then, what if they didn’t split up? \\nWhat if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it \\nbecame excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their \\npresence, so that he was shut out for good? \\n\\n“Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the \\nstump just as Hermione managed to burst the first \\none open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling \\nlike pale green worms. \\n\\nThe rest of the lesson passed without further mention \\nof Slughorn’s party. Although Harry watched his two \\nfriends more closely over the next few days, Ron and \\nHermione did not seem any different except that they \\nwere a little politer to each other than usual. Harry \\nsupposed he would just have to wait to see what \\nhappened under the influence of butterbeer in \\nSlughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party. In \\nthe meantime, however, he had more pressing \\nworries. \\n\\nKatie Bell was still in St. Mungo’s Hospital with no \\nprospect of leaving, which meant that the promising \\nGryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully \\nsince September was one Chaser short. He kept \\nputting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would \\nreturn, but their opening match against Slytherin was \\nlooming, and he finally had to accept that she would \\nnot be back in time to play. \\n\\nHarry did not think he could stand another full- \\nHouse tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to \\ndo with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after \\nTransfiguration one day. Most of the class had \\nalready left, although several twittering yellow birds \\nwere still zooming around the room, all of Hermione ’s \\nPage | 318 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncreation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so \\nmuch as a feather from thin air. \\n\\n“Are you still interested in playing Chaser?” \\n\\n“Wha — ? Yeah, of course!” said Dean excitedly. Over \\nDean’s shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnigan \\nslamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of \\nthe reasons why Harry would have preferred not to \\nhave to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus \\nwould not like it. On the other hand, he had to do \\nwhat was best for the team, and Dean had outflown \\nSeamus at the tryouts. \\n\\n“Well then, you’re in,” said Harry. “There’s a practice \\ntonight, seven o’clock.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Dean. “Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can’t \\nwait to tell Ginny!” \\n\\nHe sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and \\nSeamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment \\nmade no easier when a bird dropping landed on \\nSeamus’s head as one of Hermione’s canaries whizzed \\nover them. \\n\\nSeamus was not the only person disgruntled by the \\nchoice of Katie’s substitute. There was much \\nmuttering in the common room about the fact that \\nHarry had now chosen two of his classmates for the \\nteam. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings \\nthan this in his school career, he was not particularly \\nbothered, but all the same, the pressure was \\nincreasing to provide a win in the upcoming match \\nagainst Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that \\nthe whole House would forget that they had criticized \\nhim and swear that they had always known it was a \\ngreat team. If they lost ... well, Harry thought wryly, \\nhe had still endured worse mutterings. ... \\n\\nPage | 319 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw \\nDean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and \\nDemelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting \\nbetter all the time. The only problem was Ron. \\n\\nHarry had known all along that Ron was an \\ninconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a \\nlack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming \\nprospect of the opening game of the season seemed to \\nhave brought out all his old insecurities. After letting \\nin half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, \\nhis technique became wilder and wilder, until he \\nfinally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the \\nmouth. \\n\\n“It was an accident, I’m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!” \\nRon shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the \\nground, dripping blood everywhere. “I just — ” \\n\\n“Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to \\nDemelza and examining her fat lip. “You prat, Ron, \\nlook at the state of her!” \\n\\n“I can fix that,” said Harry, landing beside the two \\ngirls, pointing his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and \\nsaying “Episkey.” “And Ginny, don’t call Ron a prat, \\nyou’re not the Captain of this team — ” \\n\\n“Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I \\nthought someone should — ” \\n\\nHarry forced himself not to laugh. \\n\\n“In the air, everyone, let’s go. ...” \\n\\nOverall it was one of the worst practices they had had \\nall term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was \\nthe best policy when they were this close to the \\nmatch. \\n\\nPage | 320 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin,” \\nhe said bracingly and the Chasers and Beaters left \\nthe changing room looking reasonably happy with \\nthemselves. \\n\\n“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said Ron in a \\nhollow voice when the door had swung shut behind \\nGinny. \\n\\n“No, you didn’t,” said Harry firmly. “You’re the best \\nKeeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.” \\n\\nHe kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the \\nway back to the castle, and by the time they reached \\nthe second floor, Ron was looking marginally more \\ncheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to \\ntake their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, \\nhowever, they found themselves looking at Dean and \\nGinny, who were locked in a close embrace and \\nkissing fiercely as though glued together. \\n\\nIt was as though something large and scaly erupted \\ninto life in Harry’s stomach, clawing at his insides: \\n\\nHot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all \\nthought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge \\nto jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden \\nmadness, he heard Ron’s voice as though from a great \\ndistance away. \\n\\n“Oi!” \\n\\n\\n\\nDean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. \\n“What?” said Ginny. \\n\\n“I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in \\npublic!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 321 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“This was a deserted corridor till you came butting \\nin!” said Ginny. \\n\\nDean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a \\nshifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn \\nmonster inside him was roaring for Dean’s instant \\ndismissal from the team. \\n\\n“Er ... c’mon, Ginny,” said Dean, “let’s go back to the \\ncommon room. ...” \\n\\n“You go!” said Ginny. “I want a word with my dear \\nbrother!” \\n\\nDean left, looking as though he was not sorry to \\ndepart the scene. \\n\\n“Right,” said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of \\nher face and glaring at Ron, “let’s get this straight \\nonce and for all. It is none of your business who I go \\nout with or what I do with them, Ron — ” \\n\\n“Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily. “D’you think I \\nwant people saying my sister’s a — ” \\n\\n“A what?” shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. “A what, \\nexactly?” \\n\\n“He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny — ” said Harry \\nautomatically, though the monster was roaring its \\napproval of Ron’s words. \\n\\n“Oh yes he does!” she said, flaring up at Harry. “Just \\nbecause he’s never snogged anyone in his life, just \\nbecause the best kiss he’s ever had is from our Auntie \\nMuriel — ” \\n\\n“Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and \\nturning maroon. \\n\\nPage | 322 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, I will not!” yelled Ginny, beside herself. “I’ve seen \\nyou with Phlegm, hoping shell kiss you on the cheek \\nevery time you see her, it’s pathetic! If you went out \\nand got a bit of snogging done yourself, you wouldn’t \\nmind so much that everyone else does it!” \\n\\nRon had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped \\nswiftly between them. \\n\\n“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron \\nroared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around \\nHarry, who was now standing in front of her with his \\narms outstretched. “Just because I don’t do it in \\npublic — !” \\n\\nGinny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push \\nHarry out of the way. \\n\\n“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got \\na picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your \\npillow?” \\n\\n“You—” \\n\\nA streak of orange light flew under Harry’s left arm \\nand missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up \\nagainst the wall. \\n\\n“Don’t be stupid — ” \\n\\n“Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who \\nsounded close to tears now. “And Hermione snogged \\nViktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something \\ndisgusting, Ron, and that’s because you’ve got about \\nas much experience as a twelve-year-old!” \\n\\nAnd with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go \\nof Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They \\nboth stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, \\n\\nPage | 323 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFilch ’s cat, appeared around the corner, which broke \\nthe tension. \\n\\n\\n\\n“C’mon,” said Harry, as the sound of Filch ’s shuffling \\nfeet reached their ears. \\n\\nThey hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor \\ncorridor. “Oi, out of the way!” Ron barked at a small \\ngirl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of \\ntoadspawn. \\n\\nHarry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he \\nfelt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt \\nmust be something like this. It’s just because she’s \\nRon’s sister, he told himself. You just didn’t like seeing \\nher kissing Dean because she’s Ron’s sister. ... \\n\\nBut unbidden into his mind came an image of that \\nsame deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny \\ninstead. ... The monster in his chest purred ... but \\nthen he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain \\nand drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like \\n“betrayal of trust” . . . “supposed to be my friend” . . . \\n\\n“D’you think Hermione did snog Krum?” Ron asked \\nabruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry \\ngave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination \\naway from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in \\nwhich he and Ginny were quite alone — \\n\\n“What?” he said confusedly. “Oh ... er ...” \\n\\nThe honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to \\ngive it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from \\nthe look on Harry’s face. \\n\\n“Dilligrout,” he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they \\nclimbed through the portrait hole into the common \\nroom. \\n\\nPage | 324 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; \\nindeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening \\nand got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own \\nthoughts. \\n\\nHarry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the \\ncanopy of his four-poster and trying to convince \\nhimself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder- \\nbrotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother \\nand sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing \\nRon, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He \\nhad known Ginny for years now. ... It was natural \\nthat he should feel protective . . . natural that he \\nshould want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean \\nlimb from limb for kissing her ... No ... he would have \\nto control that particular brotherly feeling. . . . \\n\\nRon gave a great grunting snore. \\n\\nShe’s Ron’s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron’s \\nsister. She’s out-of-bounds. He would not risk his \\nfriendship with Ron for anything. He punched his \\npillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for \\nsleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his \\nthoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny. \\n\\nHarry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and \\nconfused by a series of dreams in which Ron had \\nchased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday he \\nwould have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the \\nreal one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny \\nand Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered \\nHermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What \\nwas more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as \\ntouchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast- \\nEnded Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to \\nkeep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no \\nsuccess; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high \\ndudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys’ dormitory \\nPage | 325 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nafter swearing angrily at several frightened first years \\nfor looking at him. \\n\\nTo Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear \\noff over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided \\nwith an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which \\nmade him still more aggressive, so that during the \\nfinal Quidditch practice before Saturday’s match, he \\nfailed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at \\nhim, but bellowed at everybody so much that he \\nreduced Demelza Robins to tears. \\n\\n“You shut up and leave her alone!” shouted Peakes, \\nwho was about two-thirds Ron’s height, though \\nadmittedly carrying a heavy bat. \\n\\n“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny \\nglowering in Ron’s direction and, remembering her \\nreputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat- \\nBogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got \\nout of hand. “Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. \\nDemelza, pull yourself together, you played really well \\ntoday. Ron ...” he waited until the rest of the team \\nwere out of earshot before saying it, “you’re my best \\nmate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this \\nand I’m going to kick you off the team.” \\n\\nHe really thought for a moment that Ron might hit \\nhim, but then something much worse happened: Ron \\nseemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of \\nhim and he said, “I resign. I’m pathetic.” \\n\\n“You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said \\nHarry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. \\n“You can save anything when you’re on form, it’s a \\nmental problem you’ve got!” \\n\\n“You calling me mental?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 326 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah, maybe I am!” \\n\\nThey glared at each other for a moment, then Ron \\nshook his head wearily. “I know you haven’t got any \\ntime to find another Keeper, so I’ll play tomorrow, but \\nif we lose, and we will, I’m taking myself off the team.” \\n\\nNothing Harry said made any difference. He tried \\nboosting Ron’s confidence all through dinner, but Ron \\nwas too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione \\nto notice. Harry persisted in the common room that \\nevening, but his assertion that the whole team would \\nbe devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined \\nby the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a \\nhuddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about \\nRon and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried \\ngetting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into \\na defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this \\nstrategy did not appear to work any better than \\nencouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and \\nhopeless as ever. \\n\\nHarry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. \\nHe did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only \\nwas it his first as Captain, but he was determined to \\nbeat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not \\nyet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played \\nas he had done in the last few practices, their \\nchances of winning were very slim. ... \\n\\nIf only there was something he could do to make Ron \\npull himself together . . . make him play at the top of \\nhis form . . . something that would ensure that Ron \\nhad a really good day. ... \\n\\nAnd the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, \\nglorious stroke of inspiration. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 327 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBreakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; \\nthe Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every \\nmember of the Gryffindor team entered the Great \\nHall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, \\npale blue sky: a good omen. \\n\\nThe Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, \\ncheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned \\nand waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head. \\n\\n“Cheer up, Ron!” called Lavender. “I know you’ll be \\nbrilliant!” \\n\\nRon ignored her. \\n\\n“Tea?” Harry asked him. “Coffee? Pumpkin juice?” \\n\\n“Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of \\ntoast. \\n\\nA few minutes later Hermione, who had become so \\ntired of Ron’s recent unpleasant behavior that she \\nhad not come down to breakfast with them, paused \\non her way up the table. \\n\\n“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her \\neyes on the back of Ron’s head. \\n\\n“Fine,” said Harry, who was concentrating on handing \\nRon a glass of pumpkin juice. “There you go, Ron. \\nDrink up.” \\n\\nRon had just raised the glass to his lips when \\nHermione spoke sharply. \\n\\n“Don’t drink that, Ron!” \\n\\nBoth Harry and Ron looked up at her. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 328 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why not?” said Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\nHermione was now staring at Harry as though she \\ncould not believe her eyes. \\n\\n“You just put something in that drink.” \\n\\n“Excuse me?” said Harry. \\n\\n“You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something \\ninto Ron’s drink. You’ve got the bottle in your hand \\nright now!” \\n\\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, \\nstowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket. \\n\\n“Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it!” Hermione said \\nagain, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained \\nit in one gulp, and said, “Stop bossing me around, \\nHermione.” \\n\\nShe looked scandalized. Bending low so that only \\nHarry could hear her, she hissed, “You should be \\nexpelled for that. I’d never have believed it of you, \\nHarry!” \\n\\n“Hark who’s talking,” he whispered back. “Confunded \\nanyone lately?” \\n\\nShe stormed up the table away from them. Harry \\nwatched her go without regret. Hermione had never \\nreally understood what a serious business Quidditch \\nwas. He then looked around at Ron, who was \\nsmacking his lips. \\n\\n“Nearly time,” said Harry blithely. \\n\\nThe frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode \\ndown to the stadium. \\n\\nPage | 329 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” Harry \\nasked Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking. \\n\\nGinny and Demelza were already wearing their \\nQuidditch robes and waiting in the changing room. \\n\\n“Conditions look ideal,” said Ginny, ignoring Ron. \\n\\n“And guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he \\ntook a Bludger in the head yesterday during their \\npractice, and he’s too sore to play! And even better \\nthan that — Malfoy’s gone off sick too!” \\n\\n“ What?” said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. \\n“He’s ill? What’s wrong with him?” \\n\\n“No idea, but it’s great for us,” said Ginny brightly. \\n“They’re playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and \\nhe’s an idiot.” \\n\\nHarry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his \\nscarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy \\nhad once before claimed he could not play due to \\ninjury, but on that occasion he had made sure the \\nwhole match was rescheduled for a time that suited \\nthe Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a \\nsubstitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking? \\n\\n“Fishy, isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to Ron. \\n“Malfoy not playing?” \\n\\n“Lucky, I call it,” said Ron, looking slightly more \\nanimated. “And Vaisey off too, he’s their best goal \\nscorer, I didn’t fancy — hey!” he said suddenly, \\nfreezing halfway through pulling on his Keeper’s \\ngloves and staring at Harry. \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\nPage | 330 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I ... you ...” Ron had dropped his voice, he looked \\nboth scared and excited. “My drink ... my pumpkin \\njuice ... you didn’t ... ?” \\n\\nHarry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, \\n“Well be starting in about five minutes, you’d better \\nget your boots on.” \\n\\nThey walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars \\nand boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and \\ngold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many \\nHufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: \\nAmidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could \\ndistinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood’s famous \\nlion-topped hat. \\n\\nHarry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who \\nwas standing ready to release the balls from the crate. \\n\\n“Captains shake hands,” she said, and Harry had his \\nhand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, \\n\\nUrquhart. “Mount your brooms. On the whistle ... \\nthree ... two ... one ...” \\n\\nThe whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off \\nhard from the frozen ground, and they were away. \\n\\nHarry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, \\nlooking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on \\nHarper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a \\nvoice that was jarringly different to the usual \\ncommentator’s started up. \\n\\n“Well, there they go, and I think we’re all surprised to \\nsee the team that Potter’s put together this year. \\n\\nMany thought, given Ronald Weasley’s patchy \\nperformance as Keeper last year, that he might be off \\nthe team, but of course, a close personal friendship \\nwith the Captain does help. ...” \\n\\nPage | 331 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese words were greeted with jeers and applause \\nfrom the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned \\naround on his broom to look toward the \\ncommentator’s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy with \\nan upturned nose was standing there, talking into the \\nmagical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan’s; \\nHarry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player \\nwhom he heartily disliked. \\n\\n“Oh, and here comes Slytherin ’s first attempt on goal, \\nit’s Urquhart streaking down the pitch and — ” \\n\\nHarry’s stomach turned over. \\n\\n“ — Weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky \\nsometimes, I suppose. ...” \\n\\n“That’s right, Smith, he is,” muttered Harry, grinning \\nto himself, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his \\neyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive \\nSnitch. \\n\\nWith half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were \\nleading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some \\ntruly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his \\ngloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor’s \\nsix goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias \\nwondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only \\nthere because Harry liked them, and he started on \\nPeakes and Coote instead. \\n\\n“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a \\nBeater,” said Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a \\nbit more muscle — ” \\n\\n“Hit a Bludger at him!” Harry called to Coote as he \\nzoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to \\naim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just \\npassing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was \\n\\nPage | 332 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the \\nBludger had found its mark. \\n\\nIt seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. \\nAgain and again they scored, and again and again, at \\nthe other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with \\napparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and \\nwhen the crowd greeted a particularly good save with \\na rousing chorus of the old favorite “Weasley Is Our \\nKing,” he pretended to conduct them from on high. \\n\\n“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” \\nsaid a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off \\nhis broom as Harper collided with him hard and \\ndeliberately. “Your blood-traitor pal ...” \\n\\nMadam Hooch’s back was turned, and though \\nGryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she \\nlooked around, Harper had already sped off. His \\nshoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to \\nram him back. . . . \\n\\n“And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” \\nsaid Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. “Yes, \\nhe’s certainly seen something Potter hasn’t!” \\n\\nSmith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn’t he \\nnoticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach \\nseemed to drop out of the sky — Smith was right and \\nHarry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at \\nrandom; he had spotted what Harry had not: The \\nSnitch was speeding along high above them, glinting \\nbrightly against the clear blue sky. \\n\\nHarry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears \\nso that it drowned all sound of Smith’s commentary \\nor the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and \\nGryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 333 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngot there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now Harper \\nwas feet from it, his hand outstretched. ... \\n\\n“Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation. “How much \\ndid Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?” \\n\\nHe did not know what made him say it, but Harper \\ndid a double-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip \\nthrough his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry \\nmade a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and \\ncaught it. \\n\\n“YES!” Harry yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled \\nback toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his \\nhand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a \\ngreat shout went up that almost drowned the sound \\nof the whistle that signaled the end of the game. \\n\\n“Ginny, where ’re you going?” yelled Harry, who had \\nfound himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair \\nhug with the rest of the team, but Ginny sped right \\non past them until, with an almighty crash, she \\ncollided with the commentator’s podium. As the \\ncrowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team \\nlanded beside the wreckage of wood under which \\nZacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard Ginny \\nsaying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, \\n“Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.” \\n\\nLaughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and \\nhugged Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her \\ngaze, he clapped a cheering Ron on the back instead \\nas, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the \\npitch arm in arm, punching the air and waving to \\ntheir supporters. \\n\\nThe atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 334 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Party up in the common room, Seamus said!” yelled \\nDean exuberantly. “C’mon, Ginny, Demelza!” \\n\\nRon and Harry were the last two in the changing \\nroom. They were just about to leave when Hermione \\nentered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her \\nhands and looked upset but determined. \\n\\n“I want a word with you, Harry.” She took a deep \\nbreath. “You shouldn’t have done it. You heard \\nSlughorn, it’s illegal.” \\n\\n“What are you going to do, turn us in?” demanded \\nRon. \\n\\n“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, \\nturning away to hang up his robes so that neither of \\nthem would see him grinning. \\n\\n“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” \\nsaid Hermione shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s juice with \\nlucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!” \\n\\n“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them \\nboth. \\n\\n“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went \\nright, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron \\nsaved everything!” \\n\\n“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He \\nslipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew \\nout the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his \\nhand that morning. It was full of golden potion and \\nthe cork was still tightly sealed with wax. “I wanted \\nRon to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you \\nwere looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved \\neverything because you felt lucky. You did it all \\nyourself.” \\n\\nPage | 335 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe pocketed the potion again. \\n\\n\\n\\n“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” \\nRon said, astounded. “But the weather’s good ... and \\nVaisey couldn’t play. ... I honestly haven’t been given \\nlucky potion?” \\n\\nHarry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a \\nmoment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her \\nvoice. “ You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this \\nmorning, that’s why he saved every thing\\\\ See! I can \\nsave goals without help, Hermione!” \\n\\n“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d \\nbeen given it too!” \\n\\nBut Ron had already strode past her out of the door \\nwith his broomstick over his shoulder. \\n\\n“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not \\nexpected his plan to backfire like this, “shall ... shall \\nwe go up to the party, then?” \\n\\n“You go!” said Hermione, blinking back tears. “I’m \\nsick of Ron at the moment, I don’t know what I’m \\nsupposed to have done. ...” \\n\\nAnd she stormed out of the changing room too. \\n\\nHarry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the \\ncastle through the crowd, many of whom shouted \\ncongratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of \\nletdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, \\nhe and Hermione would be friends again immediately. \\nHe did not see how he could possibly explain to \\nHermione that what she had done to offend Ron was \\nkiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred \\nso long ago. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 336 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor \\ncelebration party, which was in full swing when he \\narrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his \\nappearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of \\npeople congratulating him. What with trying to shake \\noff the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow \\nmatch analysis, and the large group of girls that \\nencircled him, laughing at his least amusing \\ncomments and batting their eyelids, it was some time \\nbefore he could try and find Ron. At last, he \\nextricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was \\nhinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorn’s \\nChristmas party with him. As he was ducking toward \\nthe drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, \\n\\nArnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and \\nCrookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels. \\n\\n“Looking for Ron?” she asked, smirking. “He’s over \\nthere, the filthy hypocrite.” \\n\\nHarry looked into the corner she was indicating. \\n\\nThere, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron \\nwrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was \\nhard to tell whose hands were whose. \\n\\n“It looks like he’s eating her face, doesn’t it?” said \\nGinny dispassionately. “But I suppose he’s got to \\nrefine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry.” \\n\\nShe patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping \\nsensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to \\nhelp herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted \\nafter her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold. \\n\\nHarry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he \\nwould be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was \\nclosing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a \\nmane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 337 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, \\nand pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The \\ncorridor outside seemed to be deserted. \\n\\n“Hermione?” \\n\\nHe found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. \\nShe was sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for \\na small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her \\nhead, which she had clearly just conjured out of \\nmidair. Harry could not help admiring her spell-work \\nat a time like this. \\n\\n“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was \\njust practicing.” \\n\\n“Yeah ... they’re — er — really good. ...” said Harry. \\n\\nHe had no idea what to say to her. He was just \\nwondering whether there was any chance that she \\nhad not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the \\nroom because the party was a little too rowdy, when \\nshe said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron \\nseems to be enjoying the celebrations.” \\n\\n“Er . . . does he?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said Hermione. \\n\\n“He wasn’t exactly hiding it, was — ?” \\n\\nThe door behind them burst open. To Harry’s horror, \\nRon came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand. \\n\\n“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry \\nand Hermione. \\n\\n“Oops!” said Lavender, and she backed out of the \\nroom, giggling. The door swung shut behind her. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 338 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. \\nHermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at \\nher, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and \\nawkwardness, “Hi, Harry! Wondered where you’d got \\nto!” \\n\\nHermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden \\nbirds continued to twitter in circles around her head \\nso that she looked like a strange, feathery model of \\nthe solar system. \\n\\n“You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she \\nsaid quietly. “She’ll wonder where you’ve gone.” \\n\\nShe walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. \\nHarry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that \\nnothing worse had happened. \\n\\n“ Oppugno\\\\” came a shriek from the doorway. \\n\\nHarry spun around to see Hermione pointing her \\nwand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of \\nbirds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets \\ntoward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his \\nhands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at \\nevery bit of flesh they could reach. \\n\\n“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of \\nvindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door \\nand disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a \\nsob before it slammed. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 339 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE UNBREAKABLE VOW \\n\\nSnow was swirling against the icy windows once \\nmore; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had \\nalready single-handedly delivered the usual twelve \\nChristmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly \\nand tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of \\nthe stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the \\nhelmets of suits of armor and great bunches of \\nmistletoe had been hung at intervals along the \\ncorridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge \\nunderneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry \\nwent past, which caused blockages in the corridors; \\nfortunately, however, Harry’s frequent nighttime \\nwanderings had given him an unusually good \\nknowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that \\nhe was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate \\nmistletoe-free routes between classes. \\n\\nRon, who might once have found the necessity of \\nthese detours a cause for jealousy rather than \\nhilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. \\nAlthough Harry much preferred this new laughing, \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 340 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\njoking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had \\nbeen enduring for the last few weeks, the improved \\nRon came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put \\nup with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, \\nwho seemed to regard any moment that she was not \\nkissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, \\n\\nHarry found himself once more the best friend of two \\npeople who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each \\nother again. \\n\\nRon, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches \\nand cuts from Hermione’s bird attack, was taking a \\ndefensive and resentful tone. \\n\\n“She can’t complain,” he told Harry. “She snogged \\nKrum. So she’s found out someone wants to snog me \\ntoo. Well, it’s a free country. I haven’t done anything \\nwrong.” \\n\\nHarry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed \\nin the book they were supposed to have read before \\nCharms next morning (Quintessence: A Quest). \\nDetermined as he was to remain friends with both \\nRon and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with \\nhis mouth shut tight. \\n\\n“I never promised Hermione anything,” Ron mumbled. \\n“I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn’s \\nChristmas party with her, but she never said ... just \\nas friends ... I’m a free agent. ...” \\n\\nHarry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron \\nwas watching him. Ron’s voice tailed away in mutters, \\nbarely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, \\nthough Harry thought he caught the words “Krum” \\nand “can’t complain” again. \\n\\nHermione’s schedule was so full that Harry could only \\ntalk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in \\n\\nPage | 341 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nany case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he \\ndid not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione \\nrefused to sit in the common room while Ron was \\nthere, so Harry generally joined her in the library, \\nwhich meant that their conversations were held in \\nwhispers. \\n\\n“He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” \\nsaid Hermione, while the librarian, Madam Pince, \\nprowled the shelves behind them. “I really couldn’t \\ncare less.” \\n\\nShe raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously \\nthat she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry \\nsaid nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish \\nfrom lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced \\nPotion-Making and continued to make notes on \\nEverlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher \\nthe Prince’s useful additions to Libatius Borage’s text. \\n\\n“And incidentally,” said Hermione, after a few \\nmoments, “you need to be careful.” \\n\\n“For the last time,” said Harry, speaking in a slightly \\nhoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of \\nsilence, “I am not giving back this book, I’ve learned \\nmore from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or \\nSlughorn have taught me in — ” \\n\\n“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” \\nsaid Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though \\nit had been rude to her. “I’m talking about earlier. I \\nwent into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in \\nhere and there were about a dozen girls in there, \\nincluding that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to \\nslip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going \\nto get you to take them to Slughorn ’s party, and they \\nall seem to have bought Fred and George’s love \\npotions, which I’m afraid to say probably work — ” \\nPage | 342 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded \\nHarry. It seemed extraordinary that Hermione’s mania \\nfor upholding rules could have abandoned her at this \\ncrucial juncture. \\n\\n“They didn’t have the potions with them in the \\nbathroom,” said Hermione scornfully. “They were just \\ndiscussing tactics. As I doubt whether even the Half- \\nBlood Prince ” — she gave the book another nasty look \\n— “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different \\nlove potions at once, I’d just invite someone to go with \\nyou, thatll stop all the others thinking they’ve still got \\na chance. It’s tomorrow night, they’re getting \\ndesperate.” \\n\\n“There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled Harry, \\nwho was still trying not to think about Ginny any \\nmore than he could help, despite the fact that she \\nkept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made \\nhim devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform \\nLegilimency. \\n\\n“Well, just be careful what you drink, because \\nRomilda Vane looked like she meant business,” said \\nHermione grimly. \\n\\nShe hitched up the long roll of parchment on which \\nshe was writing her Arithmancy essay and continued \\nto scratch away with her quill. Harry watched her \\nwith his mind a long way away. \\n\\n“Hang on a moment,” he said slowly. “I thought Filch \\nhad banned anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard \\nWheezes?” \\n\\n“And when has anyone ever paid attention to what \\nFilch has banned?” asked Hermione, still \\nconcentrating on her essay. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 343 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But I thought all the owls were being searched. So \\nhow come these girls are able to bring love potions \\ninto school?” \\n\\n“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes \\nand cough potions,” said Hermione. “It’s part of their \\nOwl Order Service.” \\n\\n“You know a lot about it.” \\n\\nHermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had \\njust given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. \\n\\n“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed \\nGinny and me in the summer,” she said coldly. “I \\ndon’t go around putting potions in people’s drinks ... \\nor pretending to, either, which is just as bad. ...” \\n\\n“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry quickly. \\n\\n“The point is, Filch is being fooled, isn’t he? These \\ngirls are getting stuff into the school disguised as \\nsomething else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have brought \\nthe necklace into the school — ?” \\n\\n“Oh, Harry ... not that again ...” \\n\\n“Come on, why not?” demanded Harry. \\n\\n“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect \\njinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don’t they? \\nThey’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects. \\nThey’d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one \\non that necklace, within seconds. But something \\nthat’s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t \\nregister — and anyway, love potions aren’t Dark or \\ndangerous — ” \\n\\n“Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of \\nRomilda Vane. \\n\\nPage | 344 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ — so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a \\ncough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt \\nhe can tell one potion from — ” \\n\\nHermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. \\nSomebody had moved close behind them among the \\ndark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later \\nthe vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince \\nappeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her \\nskin like parchment, and her long hooked nose \\nilluminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was \\ncarrying. \\n\\n“The library is now closed,” she said. “Mind you \\nreturn anything you have borrowed to the correct — \\nwhat have you been doing to that book, you depraved \\nboy?” \\n\\n“It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said Harry hastily, \\nsnatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the \\ntable as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand. \\n\\n“Despoiled!” she hissed. “Desecrated! Befouled!” \\n\\n“It’s just a book that’s been written on!” said Harry, \\ntugging it out of her grip. \\n\\nShe looked as though she might have a seizure; \\nHermione, who had hastily packed her things, \\ngrabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him \\naway. \\n\\n“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. \\nWhy did you have to bring that stupid book?” \\n\\n“It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione. Or \\nd’you think she overheard you being rude about \\nFilch? I’ve always thought there might be something \\ngoing on between them. ...” \\n\\nPage | 345 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, ha ha ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nEnjoying the fact that they could speak normally \\nagain, they made their way along the deserted, lamp- \\nlit corridors back to the common room, arguing about \\nwhether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly \\nin love with each other. \\n\\n“Baubles,” said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the \\nnew, festive password. \\n\\n“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, \\nand she swung forward to admit them. \\n\\n“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment he had \\nclimbed through the portrait hole. “Fancy a \\ngillywater?” \\n\\nHermione gave him a “what-did-I-tell-you?” look over \\nher shoulder. \\n\\n“No thanks,” said Harry quickly. “I don’t like it much.” \\n\\n“Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a \\nbox into his hands. “Chocolate Cauldrons, they’ve got \\nfirewhisky in them. My gran sent them to me, but I \\ndon’t like them.” \\n\\n“Oh — right — thanks a lot,” said Harry, who could \\nnot think what else to say. “Er — I’m just going over \\nhere with ...” \\n\\nHe hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing \\naway feebly. \\n\\n“Told you,” said Hermione succinctly. “Sooner you ask \\nsomeone, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you \\ncan — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 346 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut her face suddenly turned blank; she had just \\nspotted Ron and Lavender, who were entwined in the \\nsame armchair. \\n\\n“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it \\nwas only seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for \\nthe girls’ dormitory without another word. \\n\\nHarry went to bed comforting himself that there was \\nonly one more day of lessons to struggle through, \\nplus Slughorn’s party, after which he and Ron would \\ndepart together for the Burrow. It now seemed \\nimpossible that Ron and Hermione would make up \\nwith each other before the holidays began, but \\nperhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to \\ncalm down, think better of their behavior. . . . \\n\\nBut his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower \\nafter enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them \\nboth next day. They had just embarked upon the \\nimmensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; \\nworking in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be \\nchanging the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione \\nlaughed unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, \\nduring which he somehow managed to give himself a \\nspectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by \\ndoing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione \\njumping up and down in her seat every time Professor \\nMcGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and \\nParvati found deeply amusing and which reduced \\nHermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of \\nthe classroom on the bell, leaving half her things \\nbehind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater \\nthan Ron’s just now, scooped up her remaining \\npossessions and followed her. \\n\\nHe finally tracked her down as she emerged from a \\ngirls’ bathroom on the floor below. She was \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 347 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naccompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her \\nvaguely on the back. \\n\\n“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of \\nyour eyebrows is bright yellow?” \\n\\n“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. ...” \\n\\nHe held out her books. \\n\\n“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her \\nthings and turning away quickly to hide the fact that \\nshe was wiping her eyes on her pencil case. “Thank \\nyou, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. ...” \\n\\nAnd she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to \\noffer words of comfort, though admittedly he could \\nnot think of any. \\n\\n“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna. “I thought at first it \\nwas Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be \\nHermione. She said something about that Ron \\nWeasley. ...” \\n\\n“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry. \\n\\n“He says very funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” \\nsaid Luna, as they set off down the corridor together. \\n“But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.” \\n\\n“I s’pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her \\nusual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he \\nhad never met anyone quite like her. “So have you \\nhad a good term?” \\n\\n“Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna. “A bit lonely \\nwithout the D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She \\nstopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling \\nme ‘Loony’ the other day — ” \\n\\nPage | 348 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with \\nme tonight?” \\n\\nThe words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could \\nstop them; he heard himself say them as though it \\nwere a stranger speaking. \\n\\nLuna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in \\nsurprise. \\n\\n“Slughorn’s party? With you?” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “We’re supposed to bring guests, \\nso I thought you might like ... I mean ...” He was keen \\nto make his intentions perfectly clear. “I mean, just as \\nfriends, you know. But if you don’t want to ...” \\n\\nHe was already half hoping that she didn’t want to. \\n\\n“Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, \\nbeaming as he had never seen her beam before. \\n“Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! \\nIs that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? \\nShould I do mine too?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get \\nHermione to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in \\nthe entrance hall at eight o’clock then.” \\n\\n“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of \\nthem jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had \\njust passed right underneath Peeves, who was \\nhanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning \\nmaliciously at them. \\n\\n“ Potty asked Loony to go to the partyl Potty lurves \\nLoony ! Potty luuuuurves LooooooonyV’ \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 349 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, “Potty \\nloves Loony!” \\n\\n“Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry. And \\nsure enough, in no time at all the whole school \\nseemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna \\nLovegood to Slughorn’s party. \\n\\n“You could’ve taken anyonel” said Ron in disbelief \\nover dinner. “Anyonel And you chose Loony \\nLovegood?” \\n\\n“Don’t call her that, Ron,” snapped Ginny, pausing \\nbehind Harry on her way to join friends. “I’m really \\nglad you’re taking her, Harry, she’s so excited.” \\n\\nAnd she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. \\nHarry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was \\ntaking Luna to the party, but could not quite manage \\nit. A long way along the table, Hermione was sitting \\nalone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron \\nlooking at her furtively. \\n\\n“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry bluntly. \\n\\n“What, and get attacked by another flock of \\ncanaries?” muttered Ron. \\n\\n“What did you have to imitate her for?” \\n\\n“She laughed at my mustache!” \\n\\n“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.” \\n\\nBut Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had \\njust arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in \\nbetween Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms \\naround Ron’s neck. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 350 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly \\nembarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two \\nfriends. \\n\\n“Hi,” said Harry. “How’re you? You’re staying at \\nHogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to \\nleave.” \\n\\n“I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” \\nsaid Parvati. “That Katie thing really freaked them \\nout, but as there hasn’t been anything since ... Oh, \\nhi, Hermione!” \\n\\nParvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she \\nwas feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in \\nTransfiguration. He looked around and saw that \\nHermione was beaming back, if possible even more \\nbrightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. \\n\\n“Hi, Parvati!” said Hermione, ignoring Ron and \\nLavender completely. “Are you going to Slughorn’s \\nparty tonight?” \\n\\n“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, \\nthough, it sounds like it’s going to be really good. ... \\nYou’re going, aren’t you?” \\n\\n“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re — ” \\n\\nThere was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn \\nfrom a blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione \\nacted as though she had not seen or heard anything. \\n\\n“ — we’re going up to the party together.” \\n\\n“Cormac?” said Parvati. “Cormac McLaggen, you \\nmean?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 351 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s right,” said Hermione sweetly. “The one who \\nalmost ’ — she put a great deal of emphasis on the \\nword — “became Gryffindor Keeper.” \\n\\n“Are you going out with him, then?” asked Parvati, \\nwide-eyed. \\n\\n“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said Hermione, with a \\nmost un-Hermione-ish giggle. \\n\\n“No!” said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece \\nof gossip. “Wow, you like your Quidditch players, \\ndon’t you? First Krum, then McLaggen ...” \\n\\n“I like really good Quidditch players,” Hermione \\ncorrected her, still smiling. “Well, see you ... Got to go \\nand get ready for the party. ...” \\n\\nShe left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads \\ntogether to discuss this new development, with \\neverything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and \\nall they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron \\nlooked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was \\nleft to ponder in silence the depths to which girls \\nwould sink to get revenge. \\n\\nWhen he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock \\nthat night, he found an unusually large number of \\ngirls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring \\nat him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was \\nwearing a set of spangled silver robes that were \\nattracting a certain amount of giggles from the \\nonlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry \\nwas glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish \\nearrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her \\nSpectrespecs. \\n\\n“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get going then?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 352 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Where is the party?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the \\nmarble staircase away from all the staring and \\nmuttering. “Did you hear, there’s supposed to be a \\nvampire coming?” \\n\\n“Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna. \\n\\n“I — what?” said Harry, disconcerted. “You mean the \\nMinister of Magic?” \\n\\n“Yes, he’s a vampire,” said Luna matter-of-factly. \\n“Father wrote a very long article about it when \\nScrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but \\nhe was forced not to publish by somebody from the \\nMinistry. Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get \\nout!” \\n\\nHarry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus \\nScrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna \\nrepeating her father’s bizarre views as though they \\nwere fact, did not reply; they were already \\napproaching Slughorn’s office and the sounds of \\nlaughter, music, and loud conversation were growing \\nlouder with every step they took. \\n\\nWhether it had been built that way, or because he \\nhad used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn’s \\noffice was much larger than the usual teacher’s \\nstudy. The ceiling and walls had been draped with \\nemerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it \\nlooked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The \\nroom was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red \\nlight cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the \\ncenter of the ceiling in which real fairies were \\nfluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing \\naccompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued \\nfrom a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over \\nPage | 353 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nseveral elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a \\nnumber of house-elves were negotiating their way \\nsqueakily through the forest of knees, obscured by \\nthe heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so \\nthat they looked like little roving tables. \\n\\n“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as \\nHarry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. \\n“Come in, come in, so many people I’d like you to \\nmeet!” \\n\\nSlughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match \\nhis smoking jacket. Gripping Harry’s arm so tightly he \\nmight have been hoping to Disapparate with him, \\nSlughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry \\nseized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him. \\n\\n“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old \\nstudent of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life \\nAmongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend \\nSanguini.” \\n\\nWorple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, \\ngrabbed Harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; \\nthe vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated \\nwith dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He \\nlooked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing \\nclose to him, looking curious and excited. \\n\\n“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, \\npeering shortsightedly up into Harry’s face. “I was \\nsaying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, \\n‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we \\nhave all been waiting?’ ” \\n\\n“Er,” said Harry, “were you?” \\n\\n“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. \\n“But seriously” — his manner changed; it became \\n\\nPage | 354 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsuddenly businesslike — “I would be delighted to \\nwrite it myself — people are craving to know more \\nabout you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to \\ngrant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour \\nsessions, why, we could have the book finished within \\nmonths. And all with very little effort on your part, I \\nassure you — ask Sanguini here if it isn’t quite — \\nSanguini, stay here\\\\” added Worple, suddenly stern, \\nfor the vampire had been edging toward the nearby \\ngroup of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. “Here, \\nhave a pasty,” said Worple, seizing one from a passing \\nelf and stuffing it into Sanguini’s hand before turning \\nhis attention back to Harry. \\n\\n“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no \\nidea — ” \\n\\n“I’m definitely not interested,” said Harry firmly, “and \\nI’ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.” \\n\\nHe pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had \\nindeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear \\nbetween what looked like two members of the Weird \\nSisters. \\n\\n“Hermione! HermioneV’ \\n\\n“Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!” \\n\\n“What’s happened to you?” asked Harry, for Hermione \\nlooked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had \\njust fought her way out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare. \\n\\n“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left \\nCormac,” she said. “Under the mistletoe,” she added \\nin explanation, as Harry continued to look \\nquestioningly at her. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 355 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Serves you right for coming with him,” he told her \\nseverely. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione \\ndispassionately. “I debated for a while about \\nZacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole — ” \\n\\n“ You considered Smith?” said Harry, revolted. \\n\\n“Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, \\nMcLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let’s go \\nthis way, we’ll be able to see him coming, he’s so tall. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe three of them made their way over to the other \\nside of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the \\nway, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was \\nstanding there alone. \\n\\n“Hello,” said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney. \\n\\n“Good evening, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, \\nfocusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could \\nsmell cooking sherry again. “I haven’t seen you in my \\nclasses lately. ...” \\n\\n“No, I’ve got Firenze this year,” said Luna. \\n\\n“Oh, of course,” said Professor Trelawney with an \\nangry, drunken titter. “Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think \\nof him. You would have thought, would you not, that \\nnow I am returned to the school Professor \\nDumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no \\n... we share classes. ... It’s an insult, frankly, an \\ninsult. Do you know ...” \\n\\nProfessor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have \\nrecognized Harry. Under cover of her furious \\ncriticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione \\n\\nPage | 356 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand said, “Let’s get something straight. Are you \\nplanning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper \\ntryouts?” \\n\\nHermione raised her eyebrows. “Do you really think \\nI’d stoop that low?” \\n\\nHarry looked at her shrewdly. “Hermione, if you can \\nask out McLaggen — ” \\n\\n“There’s a difference,” said Hermione with dignity. \\n\\n“I’ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what \\nmight, or might not, have happened at Keeper \\ntryouts.” \\n\\n“Good,” said Harry fervently. “Because he’ll just fall \\napart again, and we’ll lose the next match — ” \\n\\n“Quidditch!” said Hermione angrily. “Is that all boys \\ncare about? Cormac hasn’t asked me one single \\nquestion about myself, no, I’ve just been treated to ‘A \\nHundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen’ \\nnonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes!” \\n\\nShe moved so fast it was as though she had \\nDisapparated; one moment she was there, the next, \\nshe had squeezed between two guffawing witches and \\nvanished. \\n\\n“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forcing his way \\nthrough the throng a minute later. \\n\\n“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join \\nin Luna’s conversation, forgetting for a split second to \\nwhom she was talking. \\n\\n“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, \\nvibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 357 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically. \\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. \\n“The rumors! The stories! The Chosen One’! Of \\ncourse, I have known for a very long time. ... The \\nomens were never good, Harry. . . . But why have you \\nnot returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the \\nsubject is of the utmost importance!” \\n\\n“Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most \\nimportant!” said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared \\nat Professor Trelawney’s other side, his face very red, \\nhis velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one \\nhand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “But I \\ndon’t think I’ve ever known such a natural at \\nPotions!” said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, \\nif bloodshot, eye. “Instinctive, you know — like his \\nmother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of \\nability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm \\nand seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward \\nthem. \\n\\n“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” \\nhiccuped Slughorn happily. “I was just talking about \\nHarry’s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must \\ngo to you, of course, you taught him for five years!” \\n\\nTrapped, with Slughorn’s arm around his shoulders, \\nSnape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his \\nblack eyes narrowed. \\n\\n“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to \\nteach Potter anything at all.” \\n\\n“Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. \\n“You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, \\n\\nPage | 358 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDraught of Living Death — never had a student \\nproduce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even \\nyou, Severus — ” \\n\\n“Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into \\nHarry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he \\nwanted was for Snape to start investigating the \\nsource of his newfound brilliance at Potions. \\n\\n“Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, \\n\\nHarry?” asked Slughorn. \\n\\n“Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, \\nTransfiguration, Herbology ...” \\n\\n“All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,” said \\nSnape, with the faintest sneer. \\n\\n“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry \\ndefiantly. \\n\\n“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn. \\n\\n“I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry,” said \\nLuna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. “The \\nAurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought \\neveryone knew that. They’re working to bring down \\nthe Ministry of Magic from within using a \\ncombination of Dark Magic and gum disease.” \\n\\nHarry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started \\nto laugh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just \\nfor this. Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping \\nwet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to \\nraise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy being \\ndragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch. \\n\\n“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver \\nand the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his \\n\\nPage | 359 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbulging eyes, “I discovered this boy lurking in an \\nupstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to \\nyour party and to have been delayed in setting out. \\n\\nDid you issue him with an invitation?” \\n\\nMalfoy pulled himself free of Filch ’s grip, looking \\nfurious. \\n\\n“All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said angrily. “I was \\ntrying to gatecrash, happy?” \\n\\n“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a statement at complete odds \\nwith the glee on his face. “You’re in trouble, you are! \\nDidn’t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling’s \\nout, unless you’ve got permission, didn’t he, eh?” \\n\\n“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,” said \\nSlughorn, waving a hand. “It’s Christmas, and it’s not \\na crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, \\nwe’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.” \\n\\nFilch ’s expression of outraged disappointment was \\nperfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, \\nwatching him, did Malfoy look almost equally \\nunhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as \\nthough both angry and . . . was it possible? ... a little \\nafraid? \\n\\nBut almost before Harry had registered what he had \\nseen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering \\nunder his breath; Malfoy had composed his face into \\na smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, \\nand Snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again. \\n\\n“It’s nothing, nothing,” said Slughorn, waving away \\nMalfoy ’s thanks. “I did know your grandfather, after \\nall. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 360 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy \\nquickly. “Said you were the best potion-maker he’d \\never known. ...” \\n\\nHarry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that \\nintrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to \\nSnape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, \\nafter all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had \\nseen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy \\nhad dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly \\ngrayish tinge to his skin. \\n\\n“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape \\nsuddenly. \\n\\n“Oh, now, Severus,” said Slughorn, hiccuping again, \\n“it’s Christmas, don’t be too hard — ” \\n\\n“I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, \\nor otherwise, to be,” said Snape curtly. “Follow me, \\nDraco.” \\n\\nThey left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking \\nresentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, \\nthen said, “I’ll be back in a bit, Luna — er — \\nbathroom.” \\n\\n“All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he \\nheard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume \\nthe subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor \\nTrelawney, who seemed sincerely interested. \\n\\nIt was easy, once out of the party, to pull his \\nInvisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over \\nhimself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was \\nmore difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry \\nran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by \\nthe music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn ’s \\noffice behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to \\nPage | 361 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was \\nescorting him back to the Slytherin common room. ... \\nHarry pressed his ear against door after door as he \\ndashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of \\nexcitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the \\nlast classroom in the corridor and heard voices. \\n\\n\"... cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are \\nexpelled — ” \\n\\n“I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?” \\n\\n“I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both \\nclumsy and foolish. Already you are suspected of \\nhaving a hand in it.” \\n\\n“Who suspects me?” said Malfoy angrily. “For the last \\ntime, I didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl must’ve had \\nan enemy no one knows about — don’t look at me like \\nthat! I know what you’re doing, I’m not stupid, but it \\nwon’t work — I can stop you!” \\n\\nThere was a pause and then Snape said quietly, “Ah \\n. . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, \\n\\nI see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from \\nyour master, Draco?” \\n\\n“I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just \\ndon’t want you butting in!” \\n\\nHarry pressed his ear still more closely against the \\nkeyhole. ... What had happened to make Malfoy speak \\nto Snape like this — Snape, toward whom he had \\nalways shown respect, even liking? \\n\\n“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? \\nYou have feared my interference? You realize that, \\nhad anybody else failed to come to my office when I \\nhad told them repeatedly to be there, Draco — ” \\n\\nPage | 362 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!” \\njeered Malfoy. \\n\\nThere was another pause. Then Snape said, “You \\nknow perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of \\nthose things.” \\n\\n“You’d better stop telling me to come to your office \\nthen!” \\n\\n“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that \\nHarry had to push his ear very hard against the \\nkeyhole to hear. “I am trying to help you. I swore to \\nyour mother I would protect you. I made the \\nUnbreakable Vow, Draco — ” \\n\\n“Looks like you 11 have to break it, then, because I \\ndon’t need your protection! It’s my job, he gave it to \\nme and I’m doing it, I’ve got a plan and it’s going to \\nwork, it’s just taking a bit longer than I thought it \\nwould!” \\n\\n“What is your plan?” \\n\\n“It’s none of your business!” \\n\\n“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist \\nyou — ” \\n\\n“I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not \\nalone!” \\n\\n“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish \\nin the extreme, wandering the corridors without \\nlookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes — \\n\\n\\n\\n“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you \\nhadn’t put them in detention!” \\n\\nPage | 363 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice \\nhad risen excitedly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle \\nintend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts \\nO.W.L. this time around, they will need to work a \\nlittle harder than they are doing at pres — ” \\n\\n“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against \\nthe Dark Arts — it’s all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? \\nLike any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts \\n\\n\\n\\n“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said \\nSnape. “Where do you think I would have been all \\nthese years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen \\nto me! You are being incautious, wandering around at \\nnight, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing \\nyour reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle — ” \\n\\n“They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my \\nside, better people!” \\n\\n“Then why not confide in me, and I can — ” \\n\\n“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my \\nglory!” \\n\\nThere was another pause, then Snape said coldly, \\n“You are speaking like a child. I quite understand \\nthat your father’s capture and imprisonment has \\nupset you, but — ” \\n\\nHarry had barely a second’s warning; he heard \\nMalfoy’s footsteps on the other side of the door and \\nflung himself out of the way just as it burst open; \\nMalfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the \\nopen door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant \\ncorner, and out of sight. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 364 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched \\ndown as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. \\nHis expression unfathomable, he returned to the \\nparty. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath \\nthe cloak, his mind racing. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 365 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS \\n\\n“So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely \\noffering to help him?” \\n\\n“If you ask that once more,” said Harry, “I’m going to \\nstick this sprout — ” \\n\\n“I’m only checking!” said Ron. They were standing \\nalone at the Burrow’s kitchen sink, peeling a \\nmountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was \\ndrifting past the window in front of them. \\n\\n“Yes, Snape was offering to help himl” said Harry. “He \\nsaid he’d promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, \\nthat he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something — \\n\\n\\n\\n“An Unbreakable Vow?” said Ron, looking stunned. \\n“Nah, he can’t have. ... Are you sure?” \\n\\n“Yes, I’m sure,” said Harry. “Why, what does it \\nmean?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 366 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow. ...” \\n\\n“I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. \\nWhat happens if you break it, then?” \\n\\n“You die,” said Ron simply. “Fred and George tried to \\nget me to make one when I was about five. I nearly \\ndid too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything \\nwhen Dad found us. He went mental,” said Ron, with \\na reminiscent gleam in his eyes. “Only time I’ve ever \\nseen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left \\nbuttock has never been the same since.” \\n\\n“Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock — ” \\n\\n“I beg your pardon?” said Fred’s voice as the twins \\nentered the kitchen. \\n\\n“Aaah, George, look at this. They’re using knives and \\neverything. Bless them.” \\n\\n“I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said \\nRon grumpily, “and then I’ll be able to do it by magic!” \\n\\n“But meanwhile,” said George, sitting down at the \\nkitchen table and putting his feet up on it, “we can \\nenjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a \\n— whoops-a-daisy!” \\n\\n“You made me do that!” said Ron angrily, sucking his \\ncut thumb. “You wait, when I’m seventeen — ” \\n\\n“I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto \\nunsuspected magical skills,” yawned Fred. \\n\\n“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, \\n\\nRonald,” said George, “what is this we hear from \\nGinny about you and a young lady called — unless \\nour information is faulty — Lavender Brown?” \\n\\nPage | 367 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon turned a little pink, but did not look displeased \\nas he turned back to the sprouts. “Mind your own \\nbusiness.” \\n\\n“What a snappy retort,” said Fred. “I really don’t know \\nhow you think of them. No, what we wanted to know \\nwas . . . how did it happen?” \\n\\n“What d’you mean?” \\n\\n“Did she have an accident or something?” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain \\ndamage? Careful, now!” \\n\\nMrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron \\nthrow the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into \\na paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand. \\n\\n“Ronl” she said furiously. “Don’t you ever let me see \\nyou throwing knives again!” \\n\\n“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his \\nbreath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain. \\n\\n“Fred, George, I’m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving \\ntonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.” \\n\\n“No problem,” said George. \\n\\n“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves \\nHarry and Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with \\nGinny — ” \\n\\n“ — that’ll make Ginny’s Christmas — ” muttered Fred. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 368 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ — everyone should be comfortable. Well, they’ll have \\na bed, anyway,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly \\nharassed. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?” \\nasked Fred. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. “No, \\nhe’s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.” \\n\\n“Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs. \\nWeasley left the kitchen. “One of the two. Well, let’s \\nget going, then, George.” \\n\\n“What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Can’t you help \\nus with these sprouts? You could just use your wand \\nand then well be free too!” \\n\\n“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. \\n“It’s very character-building stuff, learning to peel \\nsprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how \\ndifficult it is for Muggles and Squibs — ” \\n\\n“ — and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added \\nGeorge, throwing the paper airplane at him, “I \\nwouldn’t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. \\nWe’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty girl \\nworking in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks \\nare something marvelous ... almost like real magic. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George \\nsetting off across the snowy yard. “Would’ve only \\ntaken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone \\ntoo.” \\n\\n“I couldn’t,” said Harry. “I promised Dumbledore I \\nwouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.” \\n\\nPage | 369 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts \\nand then said, “Are you going to tell Dumbledore what \\nyou heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?” \\n\\n“Yep,” said Harry. “I’m going to tell anyone who can \\nput a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I \\nmight have another word with your dad too.” \\n\\n“Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, \\nthough.” \\n\\n“I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole \\npoint, he was refusing to tell Snape.” \\n\\nThere was silence for a moment or two, then Ron \\nsaid, “ ’Course, you know what they’ll all say? Dad \\nand Dumbledore and all of them? They’ll say Snape \\nisn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to \\nfind out what Malfoy’s up to.” \\n\\n“They didn’t hear him,” said Harry flatly. “No one’s \\nthat good an actor, not even Snape.” \\n\\n“Yeah ... I’m just saying, though,” said Ron. \\n\\nHarry turned to face him, frowning. “You think I’m \\nright, though?” \\n\\n“Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily. “Seriously, I do! But \\nthey’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t \\nthey?” \\n\\nHarry said nothing. It had already occurred to him \\nthat this would be the most likely objection to his new \\nevidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, \\nHarry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick \\nMalfoy into telling him what he’s doing. ... \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 370 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was pure imagination, however, as he had had \\nno opportunity to tell Hermione what he had \\noverheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn’s \\nparry before he returned to it, or so he had been \\ninformed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already \\ngone to bed by the time he returned to the common \\nroom. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the \\nnext day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy \\nChristmas and to tell her that he had some very \\nimportant news when they got back from the \\nholidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard \\nhim, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a \\nthoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the \\ntime. \\n\\nStill, even Hermione would not be able to deny one \\nthing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and \\nSnape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying “I \\ntold you so,” which he had done several times to Ron \\nalready. \\n\\nHarry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, \\nwho was working very long hours at the Ministry, \\nuntil Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their \\nguests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny \\nhad decorated so lavishly that it was rather like \\nsitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, \\n\\nHarry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the \\nangel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome \\nthat had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up \\ncarrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, \\nstuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings \\nglued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the \\nugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald \\nhead like a potato and rather hairy feet. \\n\\nThey were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas \\nbroadcast by Mrs. Weasley’s favorite singer, Celestina \\nWarbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large \\n\\nPage | 371 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find \\nCelestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the \\ncorner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her \\nwand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew \\nlouder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy \\nnumber called “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” \\nFred and George started a game of Exploding Snap \\nwith Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert \\nlooks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, \\nRemus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged- \\nlooking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring \\ninto its depths as though he could not hear \\nCelestina’s voice. \\n\\nOh, come and stir my cauldron, \\n\\nAnd if you do it right, \\n\\nI’ll boil you up some hot strong love \\nTo keep you warm tonight. \\n\\n“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. \\nWeasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. “Do you \\nremember, Arthur?” \\n\\n“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been \\nnodding over the satsuma he was peeling. “Oh yes . . . \\nmarvelous tune ...” \\n\\nWith an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked \\naround at Harry, who was sitting next to him. \\n\\n“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward \\nthe wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. “Be \\nover soon.” \\n\\n“No problem,” said Harry, grinning. “Has it been busy \\nat the Ministry?” \\n\\n“Very,” said Mr. Weasley. “I wouldn’t mind if we were \\ngetting anywhere, but of the three arrests we’ve made \\n\\nPage | 372 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them \\nis a genuine Death Eater — only don’t repeat that, \\nHarry,” he added quickly, looking much more awake \\nall of a sudden. \\n\\n“They’re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?” \\nasked Harry. \\n\\n“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know \\nDumbledore’s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour \\nabout Stan. ... I mean, anybody who has actually \\ninterviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a \\nDeath Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels \\nwant to look as though they’re making some progress, \\nand ‘three arrests’ sounds better than ‘three mistaken \\narrests and releases’... but again, this is all top \\nsecret. ...” \\n\\n“I won’t say anything,” said Harry. He hesitated for a \\nmoment, wondering how best to embark on what he \\nwanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, \\nCelestina Warbeck began a ballad called “You \\nCharmed the Heart Right Out of Me.” \\n\\n“Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station \\nwhen we were setting off for school?” \\n\\n“I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went \\nand searched the Malfoys’ house. There was nothing, \\neither broken or whole, that shouldn’t have been \\nthere.” \\n\\n“Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked \\n... but this is something different. ... Well, something \\nmore ...” \\n\\nAnd he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard \\nbetween Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw \\nLupin’s head turn a little toward him, taking in every \\n\\nPage | 373 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nword. When he had finished, there was silence, except \\nfor Celestina’s crooning. \\n\\nOh, my poor heart, where has it gone? \\n\\nIt’s left me for a spell . . . \\n\\n“Has it occurred to you, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, \\n“that Snape was simply pretending — ?” \\n\\n“Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out \\nwhat Malfoy’s up to?” said Harry quickly. “Yeah, I \\nthought you’d say that. But how do we know?” \\n\\n“It isn’t our business to know,” said Lupin \\nunexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now \\nand faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. “It’s \\nDumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, \\nand that ought to be good enough for all of us.” \\n\\n“But,” said Harry, “just say — just say Dumbledore’s \\nwrong about Snape — ” \\n\\n“People have said it, many times. It comes down to \\nwhether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I \\ndo; therefore, I trust Severus.” \\n\\n“But Dumbledore can make mistakes,” argued Harry. \\n“He says it himself. And you” — he looked Lupin \\nstraight in the eye — “do you honestly like Snape?” \\n\\n“I neither like nor dislike Severus,” said Lupin. “No, \\nHarry, I am speaking the truth,” he added, as Harry \\npulled a skeptical expression. “We shall never be \\nbosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened \\nbetween James and Sirius and Severus, there is too \\nmuch bitterness there. But I do not forget that during \\nthe year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the \\nWolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it \\nPage | 374 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nperfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually \\ndo at the full moon.” \\n\\n“But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, \\nso you had to leave!” said Harry angrily. \\n\\nLupin shrugged. “The news would have leaked out \\nanyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he \\ncould have wreaked much worse damage on me by \\ntampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I \\nmust be grateful.” \\n\\n“Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with \\nDumbledore watching him!” said Harry. \\n\\n“You are determined to hate him, Harry,” said Lupin \\nwith a faint smile. “And I understand; with James as \\nyour father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have \\ninherited an old prejudice. By all means tell \\nDumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but \\ndo not expect him to share your view of the matter; do \\nnot even expect him to be surprised by what you tell \\nhim. It might have been on Dumbledore’s orders that \\nSeverus questioned Draco.” \\n\\n... and now you’ve torn it quite apart \\n\\nI’ll thank you to give back my heart! \\n\\nCelestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched \\nnote and loud applause issued out of the wireless, \\nwhich Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically. \\n\\n“Eez eet over?” said Fleur loudly. “Thank goodness, \\nwhat an ’orrible — ” \\n\\n“Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley \\nloudly, leaping to his feet. “Who wants eggnog?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 375 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What have you been up to lately?” Harry asked \\nLupin, as Mr. Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, \\nand everybody else stretched and broke into \\nconversation. \\n\\n“Oh, I’ve been underground,” said Lupin. “Almost \\nliterally. That’s why I haven’t been able to write, \\n\\nHarry; sending letters to you would have been \\nsomething of a giveaway.” \\n\\n“What do you mean?” \\n\\n“I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said \\nLupin. “Werewolves,” he added, at Harry’s look of \\nincomprehension. “Nearly all of them are on \\nVoldemort’s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here \\nI was ... ready-made.” \\n\\nHe sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for \\nhe smiled more warmly as he went on, “I am not \\ncomplaining; it is necessary work and who can do it \\nbetter than I? However, it has been difficult gaining \\ntheir trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having \\ntried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they \\nhave shunned normal society and live on the margins, \\nstealing — and sometimes killing — to eat.” \\n\\n“How come they like Voldemort?” \\n\\n“They think that, under his rule, they will have a \\nbetter life,” said Lupin. “And it is hard to argue with \\nGrey back out there. ...” \\n\\n“Who’s Grey back?” \\n\\n“You haven’t heard of him?” Lupin’s hands closed \\nconvulsively in his lap. “Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, \\nthe most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as \\nhis mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many \\n\\nPage | 376 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npeople as possible; he wants to create enough \\nwerewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has \\npromised him prey in return for his services. \\n\\nGreyback specializes in children. ... Bite them young, \\nhe says, and raise them away from their parents, \\nraise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has \\nthreatened to unleash him upon people’s sons and \\ndaughters; it is a threat that usually produces good \\nresults.” \\n\\nLupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who \\nbit me.” \\n\\n“What?” said Harry, astonished. “When — when you \\nwere a kid, you mean?” \\n\\n“Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for \\na very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had \\nattacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he \\nhad had no control, knowing by then how it felt to \\ntransform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full \\nmoon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring \\nthat he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And \\nthis is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the \\nwerewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular \\nbrand of reasoned argument is making much \\nheadway against Greyback’s insistence that we \\nwerewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge \\nourselves on normal people.” \\n\\n“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just \\ngot a — a problem — ” \\n\\nLupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me \\na lot of James. He called it my ‘furry little problem’ in \\ncompany. Many people were under the impression \\nthat I owned a badly behaved rabbit.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 377 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with \\na word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. \\nHarry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last \\nmention of his father had reminded him that there \\nwas something he had been looking forward to asking \\nLupin. \\n\\n“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half- \\nBlood Prince?” \\n\\n“The Half-Blood what?” \\n\\n“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of \\nrecognition. \\n\\n“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now \\nsmiling. “Is this a title you’re thinking of adopting? I \\nshould have thought being ‘the Chosen One’ would be \\nenough.” \\n\\n“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. \\n“The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to \\nHogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book. He wrote \\nspells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was \\nLevicorpus — ” \\n\\n“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at \\nHogwarts,” said Lupin reminiscently. “There were a \\nfew months in my fifth year when you couldn’t move \\nfor being hoisted into the air by your ankle.” \\n\\n“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the \\nPensieve, he used it on Snape.” \\n\\nHe tried to sound casual, as though this was a \\nthrowaway comment of no real importance, but he \\nwas not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s \\nsmile was a little too understanding. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 378 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it \\nwas very popular. ... You know how these spells come \\nand go. ...” \\n\\n“But it sounds like it was invented while you were at \\nschool,” Harry persisted. \\n\\n“Not necessarily,” said Lupin. “Jinxes go in and out of \\nfashion like everything else.” \\n\\nHe looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, \\n“James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, \\nhe never asked us to call him ‘Prince.’ ” \\n\\nAbandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t \\nSirius? Or you?” \\n\\n“Definitely not.” \\n\\n“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — \\nwell, he’s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the \\nPrince has.” \\n\\n“How old is this book, Harry?” \\n\\n“I dunno, I’ve never checked.” \\n\\n“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when \\nthe Prince was at Hogwarts,” said Lupin. \\n\\nShortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina \\nsinging “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which \\nwas taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. \\nWeasley’s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. \\n\\nHarry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic \\nbedroom, where a camp bed had been added for \\nHarry. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 379 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved \\ninto his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced \\nPotion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned \\nits pages, searching, until he finally found, at the \\nfront of the book, the date that it had been published. \\nIt was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his \\nfather’s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. \\nFeeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into \\nhis trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, \\nthinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike \\nand the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an \\nuneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of \\nbitten children. ... \\n\\n“She’s got to be joking. ...” \\n\\nHarry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking \\nlying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses \\nand looked around; the tiny window was almost \\ncompletely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron \\nwas sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what \\nappeared to be a thick gold chain. \\n\\n“What’s that?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted. \\n\\n“She can’t honestly think I’d wear ...” \\n\\nHarry looked more closely and let out a shout of \\nlaughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold letters \\nwere the words: \\n\\nMy Sweetheart \\n\\n“Nice,” he said. “Classy. You should definitely wear it \\nin front of Fred and George.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 380 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you tell them,” said Ron, shoving the necklace out \\nof sight under his pillow, “I — I — 111 — ” \\n\\n“Stutter at me?” said Harry, grinning. “Come on, \\nwould I?” \\n\\n“How could she think I’d like something like that, \\nthough?” Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather \\nshocked. \\n\\n“Well, think back,” said Harry. “Have you ever let it \\nslip that you’d like to go out in public with the words \\n‘My Sweetheart’ round your neck?” \\n\\n“Well ... we don’t really talk much,” said Ron. “It’s \\nmainly ...” \\n\\n“Snogging,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Well, yeah,” said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then \\nsaid, “Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?” \\n\\n“I dunno,” said Harry. “They were at Slughorn’s party \\ntogether, but I don’t think it went that well.” \\n\\nRon looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper \\ninto his stocking. \\n\\nHarry’s presents included a sweater with a large \\nGolden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by \\nMrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys’ Wizard \\nWheezes products from the twins, and a slightly \\ndamp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label \\nreading TO MASTER, FROM KREACHER. \\n\\nHarry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” \\nhe asked. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 381 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can’t be anything dangerous, all our mail’s still \\nbeing searched at the Ministry,” replied Ron, though \\nhe was eyeing the parcel suspiciously. \\n\\n“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people \\nusually give their house-elves Christmas presents?” \\nasked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously. \\n\\n“Hermione would,” said Ron. “But let’s wait and see \\nwhat it is before you start feeling guilty.” \\n\\nA moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt \\nout of his camp bed; the package contained a large \\nnumber of maggots. \\n\\n“Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter. “Very \\nthoughtful.” \\n\\n“I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said Harry, \\nwhich sobered Ron up at once. \\n\\nEverybody was wearing new sweaters when they all \\nsat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur \\n(on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted \\nto waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was \\nsporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat \\nglittering with what looked like tiny starlike \\ndiamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace. \\n\\n“Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they \\nbeautiful?” \\n\\n“Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, \\nMum, now we’re washing our own socks,” said \\nGeorge, waving an airy hand. “Parsnips, Remus?” \\n\\n“Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said Ginny \\ncheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 382 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had \\nnothing to do with the maggot. \\n\\n“ ’Ow ’orrible,” said Fleur, with an affected little \\nshudder. \\n\\n“Yes, isn’t it?” said Ron. “Gravy, Fleur?” \\n\\nIn his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy \\nboat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared \\nup in the air and returned meekly to the boat. \\n\\n“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, \\nwhen she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. “She is \\nalways knocking — ” \\n\\n“I invited dear Tonks to come along today,” said Mrs. \\nWeasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary \\nforce and glaring at Fleur. “But she wouldn’t come. \\nHave you spoken to her lately, Remus?” \\n\\n“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very \\nmuch,” said Lupin. “But Tonks has got her own \\nfamily to go to, hasn’t she?” \\n\\n“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the \\nimpression she was planning to spend Christmas \\nalone, actually.” \\n\\nShe gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all \\nhis fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law \\ninstead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, \\nwho was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own \\nfork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long- \\nlost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question \\nhe had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask \\nthan Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses? \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 383 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. \\n“Snape said so anyway. I didn’t know that could \\nhappen. Why would your Patronus change?” \\n\\nLupin took his time chewing his turkey and \\nswallowing before saying slowly, “Sometimes ... a \\ngreat shock ... an emotional upheaval ...” \\n\\n“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, \\nstruck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. \\n“Hey ... it couldn’t be — ?” \\n\\n“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen \\nfrom her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart \\nand she was staring out of the kitchen window. \\n“Arthur — it’s Percy!” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\nMr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly \\nat the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. \\n\\nThere, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding \\nacross the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses \\nglinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone. \\n\\n“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister!” \\n\\nAnd sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the \\nDaily Prophet was following along in Percy’s wake, \\nlimping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his \\nblack cloak flecked with snow. Before any of them \\ncould say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley \\ncould do more than exchange stunned looks, the back \\ndoor opened and there stood Percy. \\n\\nThere was a moment’s painful silence. Then Percy \\nsaid rather stiffly, “Merry Christmas, Mother.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 384 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Percy\\\\” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself \\ninto his arms. \\n\\n\\n\\nRufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on \\nhis walking stick and smiling as he observed this \\naffecting scene. \\n\\n“You must forgive this intrusion,” he said, when Mrs. \\nWeasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping \\nher eyes. “Percy and I were in the vicinity — working, \\nyou know — and he couldn’t resist dropping in and \\nseeing you all.” \\n\\nBut Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of \\nthe rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and \\nawkward-looking, and stared over everybody else’s \\nheads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all \\nobserving him, stony-faced. \\n\\n“Please, come in, sit down, Minister!” fluttered Mrs. \\nWeasley, straightening her hat. “Have a little purkey, \\nor some tooding. ... I mean — ” \\n\\n“No, no, my dear Molly,” said Scrimgeour. Harry \\nguessed that he had checked her name with Percy \\nbefore they entered the house. “I don’t want to \\nintrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t wanted \\nto see you all so badly. ...” \\n\\n“Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up \\nto kiss him. \\n\\n\"... We’ve only looked in for five minutes, so I’ll have a \\nstroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. \\nNo, no, I assure you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if \\nanybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . \\nAh, that young man’s finished, why doesn’t he take a \\nstroll with me?” \\n\\nPage | 385 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe atmosphere around the table changed \\nperceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to \\nHarry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense \\nthat he did not know Harry’s name convincing, or find \\nit natural that he should be chosen to accompany the \\nMinister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and \\nGeorge also had clean plates. \\n\\n“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence. \\n\\nHe was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they \\nhad just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look \\nup his family, this must be the real reason that they \\nhad come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry \\nalone. \\n\\n“It’s fine,” he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who \\nhad half risen from his chair. “Fine,” he added, as Mr. \\nWeasley opened his mouth to speak. \\n\\n“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let \\nHarry pass through the door ahead of him. “We’ll just \\ntake a turn around the garden, and Percy and I’ll be \\noff. Carry on, everyone!” \\n\\nHarry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys’ \\novergrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping \\nslightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of \\nthe Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, \\nvery different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat. \\n\\n“Charming,” said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden \\nfence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the \\nindistinguishable plants. “Charming.” \\n\\nHarry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was \\nwatching him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 386 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,” said \\nScrimgeour, after a few moments. “Did you know \\nthat?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry truthfully. \\n\\n“Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has \\nbeen very protective of you,” said Scrimgeour. \\n“Natural, of course, natural, after what you’ve been \\nthrough. ... Especially what happened at the Ministry \\n\\n\\n\\nHe waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did \\nnot oblige, so he went on, “I have been hoping for an \\noccasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but \\nDumbledore has — most understandably, as I say — \\nprevented this.” \\n\\nStill, Harry said nothing, waiting. \\n\\n“The rumors that have flown around!” said \\nScrimgeour. “Well, of course, we both know how these \\nstories get distorted ... all these whispers of a \\nprophecy ... of you being ‘the Chosen One’...” \\n\\nThey were getting near it now, Harry thought, the \\nreason Scrimgeour was here. \\n\\n\"... I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these \\nmatters with you?” \\n\\nHarry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie \\nor not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around \\nthe flowerbeds, and the scuffed-up patch that marked \\nthe spot where Fred had caught the gnome now \\nwearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. \\nFinally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it. \\n\\n“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.” \\n\\nPage | 387 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have you, have you ...” said Scrimgeour. Harry could \\nsee, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting \\nat him, so he pretended to be very interested in a \\ngnome that had just poked its head out from \\nunderneath a frozen rhododendron. “And what has \\nDumbledore told you, Harry?” \\n\\n“Sorry, but that’s between us,” said Harry. He kept \\nhis voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour’s \\ntone, too, was light and friendly as he said, “Oh, of \\ncourse, if it’s a question of confidences, I wouldn’t \\nwant you to divulge ... no, no ... and in any case, does \\nit really matter whether you are ‘the Chosen One’ or \\nnot?” ” \\n\\nHarry had to mull that one over for a few seconds \\nbefore responding. “I don’t really know what you \\nmean, Minister.” \\n\\n“Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,” \\nsaid Scrimgeour with a laugh. “But to the Wizarding \\ncommunity at large ... it’s all perception, isn’t it? It’s \\nwhat people believe that’s important.” \\n\\nHarry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where \\nthey were heading, but he was not going to help \\nScrimgeour get there. The gnome under the \\nrhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, \\nand Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it. \\n\\n“People believe you are ‘the Chosen One,’ you see,” \\nsaid Scrimgeour. “They think you quite the hero — \\nwhich, of course, you are, Harry, chosen or not! How \\nmany times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be- \\nNamed now? Well, anyway,” he pressed on, without \\nwaiting for a reply, “the point is, you are a symbol of \\nhope for many, Harry. The idea that there is \\nsomebody out there who might be able, who might \\neven be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be- \\nPage | 388 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNamed — well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I \\ncan’t help but feel that, once you realize this, you \\nmight consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand \\nalongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.” \\n\\nThe gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It \\nwas now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of \\nthe frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that \\nScrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, \\n“Funny little chaps, aren’t they? But what say you, \\nHarry?” \\n\\n“I don’t exactly understand what you want,” said \\nHarry slowly. “ ‘Stand alongside the Ministry’ ... What \\ndoes that mean?” \\n\\n“Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,” said \\nScrimgeour. “If you were to be seen popping in and \\nout of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, \\nthat would give the right impression. And of course, \\nwhile you were there, you would have ample \\nopportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my \\nsuccessor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores \\nUmbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition \\nto become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very \\neasily. ...” \\n\\nHarry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So \\nDolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she? \\n\\n“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to \\nclarify a few points, “you’d like to give the impression \\nthat I’m working for the Ministry?” \\n\\n“It would give everyone a lift to think you were more \\ninvolved, Harry,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved \\nthat Harry had cottoned on so quickly. “ The Chosen \\nOne,’ you know ... It’s all about giving people hope, \\nthe feeling that exciting things are happening. ...” \\nPage | 389 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,” \\nsaid Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, \\n“won’t that seem as though I approve of what the \\nMinistry’s up to?” \\n\\n“Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes, \\nthat’s partly why we’d like — ” \\n\\n“No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Harry pleasantly. \\n“You see, I don’t like some of the things the Ministry’s \\ndoing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.” \\n\\nScrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his \\nexpression hardened instantly. “I would not expect \\nyou to understand,” he said, and he was not as \\nsuccessful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry \\nhad been. “These are dangerous times, and certain \\nmeasures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old \\n\\n\\n\\n“Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t \\nthink Stan should be in Azkaban either,” said Harry. \\n“You’re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want \\nto make me a mascot.” \\n\\nThey looked at each other, long and hard. Finally \\nScrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, “I see. \\nYou prefer — like your hero, Dumbledore — to \\ndisassociate yourself from the Ministry?” \\n\\n“I don’t want to be used,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the \\nMinistry!” \\n\\n“Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check \\nthat people really are Death Eaters before you chuck \\nthem in prison,” said Harry, his temper rising now. \\n“You’re doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it \\n\\nPage | 390 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nright, you people, do you? Either we’ve got Fudge, \\npretending everything’s lovely while people get \\nmurdered right under his nose, or we’ve got you, \\nchucking the wrong people into jail and trying to \\npretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ working for you!” \\n\\n“So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour. \\n\\n“I thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said \\nHarry, with a bitter laugh. “Not to you anyway.” \\n\\n“I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrimgeour quickly. \\n“It was tactless — ” \\n\\n“No, it was honest,” said Harry. “One of the only \\nhonest things you’ve said to me. You don’t care \\nwhether I live or die, but you do care that I help you \\nconvince everyone you’re winning the war against \\nVoldemort. I haven’t forgotten, Minister. ...” \\n\\nHe raised his right fist. There, shining white on the \\nback of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores \\nUmbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: / \\nmust not tell lies. \\n\\n“I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I \\nwas trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The \\nMinistry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year.” \\n\\nThey stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath \\ntheir feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate \\nhis worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning \\nagainst the bottommost branches of the \\nrhododendron bush. \\n\\n“What is Dumbledore up to?” said Scrimgeour \\nbrusquely. “Where does he go when he is absent from \\nHogwarts?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 391 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No idea,” said Harry. \\n\\n“And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said \\nScrimgeour, “would you?” \\n\\n“No, I wouldn’t,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out \\nby other means.” \\n\\n“You can try,” said Harry indifferently. “But you seem \\ncleverer than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have \\nlearned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at \\nHogwarts. You might have noticed he’s not Minister \\nanymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I’d leave \\nDumbledore alone, if I were you.” \\n\\nThere was a long pause. \\n\\n“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good \\njob on you,” said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard \\nbehind his wire-rimmed glasses. “Dumbledore’s man \\nthrough and through, aren’t you, Potter?” \\n\\n“Yeah, I am,” said Harry. “Glad we straightened that \\nout.” \\n\\nAnd turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he \\nstrode back toward the house. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 392 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA SLUGGISH MEMORY \\n\\nLate in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, \\nHarry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen \\nfire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged \\nthis one-off connection to the Floo Network to return \\nstudents quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. \\nWeasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, \\nFred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. \\nWeasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. \\nAdmittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she \\nhad been crying on and off ever since Percy had \\nstormed from the house on Christmas Day with his \\nglasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which \\nFred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit). \\n\\n“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back \\nas Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. “It’s okay. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah, don’t worry about us,” said Ron, permitting his \\nmother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, “or \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 393 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nabout Percy. He’s such a prat, it’s not really a loss, is \\nit?” \\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she \\nenfolded Harry in her arms. \\n\\n“Promise me you’ll look after yourself. ... Stay out of \\ntrouble. ...” \\n\\n“I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry. “I like a quiet \\nlife, you know me.” \\n\\nShe gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “Be good, \\nthen, all of you. ...” \\n\\nHarry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted \\n“Hogwarts!” He had one last fleeting view of the \\nWeasleys’ kitchen and Mrs. Weasley’s tearful face \\nbefore the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he \\ncaught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, \\nwhich were whipped out of sight before he could get a \\nproper look; then he was slowing down, finally \\nstopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor \\nMcGonagall’s office. She barely glanced up from her \\nwork as he clambered out over the grate. \\n\\n“Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the \\ncarpet.” \\n\\n“No, Professor.” \\n\\nHarry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair \\nas Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had \\narrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall’s \\noffice and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced \\nout of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun \\nwas already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper \\nsnow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 394 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndistance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in \\nfront of his cabin. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached \\nthe Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than \\nusual and winced at his loud voice. \\n\\n“No,” she said. \\n\\n“What d’you mean, ‘no’?” \\n\\n“There is a new password,” she said. “And please \\ndon’t shout.” \\n\\n“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ?” \\n“Harry! Ginny!” \\n\\nHermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced \\nand wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves. \\n\\n“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down \\nto visit Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she \\nsaid breathlessly. “Did you have a good Christmas?” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus \\nScrim — ” \\n\\n“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, \\nneither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she \\nhad heard him. “Oh, hang on — password. \\nAbstinence.” \\n\\n“Precisely,” said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and \\nswung forward to reveal the portrait hole. \\n\\n“What’s up with her?” asked Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 395 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said \\nHermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the \\npacked common room. “She and her friend Violet \\ndrank their way through all the wine in that picture of \\ndrunk monks down by the Charms corridor. Anyway \\n\\n\\n\\nShe rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then \\npulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore’s \\nwriting on it. \\n\\n“Great,” said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover \\nthat his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled \\nfor the following night. “I’ve got loads to tell him — \\nand you. Let’s sit down — ” \\n\\nBut at that moment there was a loud squeal of “Won- \\nWon!” and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of \\nnowhere and flung herself into Ron’s arms. Several \\nonlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh \\nand said, “There’s a table over here. ... Coming, \\nGinny?” \\n\\n“No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny, \\nthough Harry could not help noticing that she did not \\nsound very enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and Lavender \\nlocked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, Harry led \\nHermione over to the spare table. \\n\\n“So how was your Christmas?” \\n\\n“Oh, fine,” she shrugged. “Nothing special. How was it \\nat Won-Won’s?” \\n\\n“I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Harry. “Look, \\n\\nHermione, can’t you — ?” \\n\\n“No, I can’t,” she said flatly. “So don’t even ask.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 396 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred- \\nyear- old wine, Harry, not me. So what was this \\nimportant news you wanted to tell me?” \\n\\nShe looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so \\nHarry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all \\nthat he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. \\nWhen he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a \\nmoment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?” \\n\\n“ — he was pretending to offer help so that he could \\ntrick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing?” \\n\\n“Well, yes,” said Hermione. \\n\\n“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said \\ngrudgingly. “But this definitely proves Malfoy’s \\nplanning something, you can’t deny that.” \\n\\n“No, I can’t,” she answered slowly. \\n\\n“And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I \\nsaid!” \\n\\n“Hmm . . . did either of them actually mention \\nVoldemort’s name?” \\n\\nHarry frowned, trying to remember. “I’m not sure ... \\nSnape definitely said your master,’ and who else \\nwould that be?” \\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “Maybe \\nhis father?” \\n\\nShe stared across the room, apparently lost in \\nthought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron. \\n“How’s Lupin?” \\n\\nPage | 397 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not great,” said Harry, and he told her all about \\nLupin’s mission among the werewolves and the \\ndifficulties he was facing. “Have you heard of this \\nFenrir Grey back?” \\n\\n“Yes, I have!” said Hermione, sounding startled. “And \\nso have you, Harry!” \\n\\n“When, History of Magic? You know full well I never \\nlistened ...” \\n\\n“No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened \\nBorgin with him!” said Hermione. “Back in Knockturn \\nAlley, don’t you remember? He told Borgin that \\nGrey back was an old family friend and that he’d be \\nchecking up on Borgin’s progress!” \\n\\nHarry gaped at her. “I forgot! But this proves Malfoy’s \\na Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with \\nGreyback and telling him what to do?” \\n\\n“It is pretty suspicious,” breathed Hermione. “Unless \\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, come on,” said Harry in exasperation, “you can’t \\nget round this one!” \\n\\n“Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty \\nthreat.” \\n\\n“You’re unbelievable, you are,” said Harry, shaking \\nhis head. “We’ll see who’s right. ... You’ll be eating \\nyour words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh \\nyeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well. ...” \\n\\nAnd the rest of the evening passed amicably with both \\nof them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, \\nlike Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 398 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry through the previous year, they had a great \\ndeal of nerve asking him for help now. \\n\\nThe new term started next morning with a pleasant \\nsurprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been \\npinned to the common room notice boards overnight. \\n\\nAPPARITION LESSONS \\n\\nIf you are seventeen years of age, or will turn \\nseventeen on or before the 31st August next, you are \\neligible for a twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons \\nfrom a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor. Please \\nsign below if you would like to participate. Cost: 12 \\nGalleons. \\n\\nHarry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling \\naround the notice and taking it in turns to write their \\nnames at the bottom. Ron was just taking out his \\nquill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up \\nbehind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and \\ntrilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” Harry turned to see \\nHermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having \\nno wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to \\nhis surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little \\nway beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and \\nhis expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione \\nsped up to walk with Neville. \\n\\n“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it \\nperfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what \\nhad just happened. “Should be a laugh, eh?” \\n\\n“I dunno,” said Harry. “Maybe it’s better when you do \\nit yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore \\ntook me along for the ride.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 399 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I forgot you’d already done it. ... I’d better pass my \\ntest first time,” said Ron, looking anxious. “Fred and \\nGeorge did.” \\n\\n“Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?” \\n\\n“Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me” — Ron held his \\narms out from his body as though he was a gorilla — \\n“so Fred and George didn’t go on about it much ... not \\nto his face anyway ...” \\n\\n“When can we take the actual test?” \\n\\n“Soon as we’re seventeen. That’s only March for me!” \\n\\n“Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, \\nnot in the castle ...” \\n\\n“Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could \\nApparate if I wanted.” \\n\\nRon was not the only one to be excited at the prospect \\nof Apparition. All that day there was much talk about \\nthe forthcoming lessons; a great deal of store was set \\nby being able to vanish and reappear at will. \\n\\n“How cool will it be when we can just — ” Seamus \\nclicked his fingers to indicate disappearance. “Me \\ncousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I \\ncan do it back ... He’ll never have another peaceful \\nmoment. ...” \\n\\nLost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his \\nwand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of \\nproducing the fountain of pure water that was the \\nobject of today’s Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike \\njet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked \\nProfessor Flitwick flat on his face. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 400 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly \\nabashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried \\nhimself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus \\nlines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a \\nstick.” “Dum — er — someone took him. Side-Along- \\nApparition, you know.” \\n\\n“Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and \\nNeville put their heads a little closer to hear what \\nApparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was \\nbesieged with requests from the other sixth years to \\ndescribe the sensation of Apparition. All of them \\nseemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them \\nhow uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering \\ndetailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when \\nhe was forced to lie and say that he needed to return \\na book to the library, so as to escape in time for his \\nlesson with Dumbledore. \\n\\nThe lamps in Dumbledore ’s office were lit, the \\nportraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently \\nin their frames, and the Pensieve was ready upon the \\ndesk once more. Dumbledore ’s hands lay on either \\nside of it, the right one as blackened and burnt- \\nlooking as ever. It did not seem to have healed at all \\nand Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, \\nwhat had caused such a distinctive injury, but did \\nnot ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know \\neventually and there was, in any case, another \\nsubject he wanted to discuss. But before Harry could \\nsay anything about Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore \\nspoke. \\n\\n“I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over \\nChristmas?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “He’s not very happy with me.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 401 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” sighed Dumbledore. “He is not very happy with \\nme either. We must try not to sink beneath our \\nanguish, Harry, but battle on.” \\n\\nHarry grinned. \\n\\n“He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that \\nthe Ministry’s doing a wonderful job.” \\n\\nDumbledore smiled. \\n\\n“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know. During his \\nlast days in office, when he was trying desperately to \\ncling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, \\nhoping that you would give him your support — ” \\n\\n“After everything Fudge did last year?” said Harry \\nangrily. “After Umbridge?” \\n\\n“I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the \\nidea did not die when he left office. Within hours of \\nScrimgeour’s appointment we met and he demanded \\nthat I arrange a meeting with you — ” \\n\\n“So that’s why you argued!” Harry blurted out. “It was \\nin the Daily Prophet” \\n\\n“The Prophet is bound to report the truth \\noccasionally,” said Dumbledore, “if only accidentally. \\nYes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that \\nRufus found a way to corner you at last.” \\n\\n“He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore ’s man through \\nand through.’ ” \\n\\n“How very rude of him.” \\n\\n“I told him I was.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 402 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then \\nclosed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let \\nout a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry’s intense \\nembarrassment, he suddenly realized that \\nDumbledore ’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, \\nand stared hastily at his own knees. When \\nDumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite \\nsteady. \\n\\n“I am very touched, Harry.” \\n\\n“Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when \\nyou’re not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, still looking \\nfixedly at his knees. \\n\\n“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dumbledore, \\nnow sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to \\nlook up again. “He has even attempted to have me \\nfollowed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It \\nwasn’t kind. I have already been forced to jinx \\nDawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.” \\n\\n“So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Harry, \\nhoping for more information on this intriguing \\nsubject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top \\nof his half-moon spectacles. \\n\\n“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you \\nto know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless \\nthere’s anything else — ?” \\n\\n“There is, actually, sir,” said Harry. “It’s about Malfoy \\nand Snape.” \\n\\n“Professor Snape, Harry.” \\n\\n“Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor \\nSlughorn’s party ... well, I followed them, actually. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 403 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore listened to Harry’s story with an \\nimpassive face. When Harry had finished he did not \\nspeak for a few moments, then said, “Thank you for \\ntelling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it \\nout of your mind. I do not think that it is of great \\nimportance.” \\n\\n“Not of great importance?” repeated Harry \\nincredulously. “Professor, did you understand — ?” \\n\\n“Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary \\nbrainpower, I understood everything you told me,” \\nsaid Dumbledore, a little sharply. “I think you might \\neven consider the possibility that I understood more \\nthan you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided \\nin me, but let me reassure you that you have not told \\nme anything that causes me disquiet.” \\n\\nHarry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. \\nWhat was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore \\nhad indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy \\nwas doing, in which case he had already heard \\neverything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or \\nwas he really worried by what he had heard, but \\npretending not to be? \\n\\n“So, sir,” said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, \\ncalm voice, “you definitely still trust — ?” \\n\\n“I have been tolerant enough to answer that question \\nalready,” said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very \\ntolerant anymore. “My answer has not changed.” \\n\\n“I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas \\nNigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. \\nDumbledore ignored him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 404 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I \\nhave more important things to discuss with you this \\nevening.” \\n\\nHarry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if \\nhe refused to permit the change of subject, if he \\ninsisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As \\nthough he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore shook \\nhis head. \\n\\n“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the \\nbest of friends! Each of us believes that what he has \\nto say is much more important than anything the \\nother might have to contribute!” \\n\\n“I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, \\nsir,” said Harry stiffly. \\n\\n“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said \\nDumbledore briskly. “I have two more memories to \\nshow you this evening, both obtained with enormous \\ndifficulty, and the second of them is, I think, the most \\nimportant I have collected.” \\n\\nHarry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry \\nat the reception his confidences had received, but \\ncould not see what was to be gained by arguing \\nfurther. \\n\\n“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet \\nthis evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom \\nwe left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years \\nat Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was \\nto hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my \\ncompany on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, \\nwarned him against continued thievery when he \\narrived at school. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 405 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it \\ncame Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand \\nrobes, who lined up with the other first years to be \\nsorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the \\nmoment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,” \\ncontinued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand \\ntoward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat \\nsat, ancient and unmoving. “How soon Riddle learned \\nthat the famous founder of the House could talk to \\nsnakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. \\nThe knowledge can only have excited him and \\nincreased his sense of self-importance. \\n\\n“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow \\nSlytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their \\ncommon room, no hint of it reached the staff. He \\nshowed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at \\nall. As an unusually talented and very good-looking \\norphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy \\nfrom the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. \\nHe seemed polite, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. \\nNearly all were most favorably impressed by him.” \\n\\n“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when \\nyou met him at the orphanage?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of \\nremorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he \\nhad behaved before and was resolved to turn over a \\nfresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.” \\n\\nDumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, \\nwho had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was \\nDumbledore ’s tendency to trust people in spite of \\noverwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! \\nBut then Harry remembered something. . . . \\n\\n“But you didn’t really trust him, sir, did you? He told \\nme . . . the Riddle who came out of that diary said, \\n\\nPage | 406 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the \\nother teachers did.’ ” \\n\\n“Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he \\nwas trustworthy,” said Dumbledore. “I had, as I have \\nalready indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon \\nhim, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a \\ngreat deal from my observations at first. He was very \\nguarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill \\nof discovering his true identity he had told me a little \\ntoo much. He was careful never to reveal as much \\nagain, but he could not take back what he had let slip \\nin his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in \\nme. However, he had the sense never to try and \\ncharm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues. \\n\\n“As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a \\ngroup of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want \\nof a better term, although as I have already indicated, \\nRiddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. \\nThis group had a kind of dark glamour within the \\ncastle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the \\nweak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some \\nshared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a \\nleader who could show them more refined forms of \\ncruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of \\nthe Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became \\nthe first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts. \\n\\n“Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected \\nin open wrongdoing, although their seven years at \\nHogwarts were marked by a number of nasty \\nincidents to which they were never satisfactorily \\nlinked, the most serious of which was, of course, the \\nopening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in \\nthe death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly \\naccused of that crime. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 407 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle \\nat Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore, placing his withered \\nhand on the Pensieve. “Few who knew him then are \\nprepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. \\nWhat I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, \\nafter much painstaking effort, after tracing those few \\nwho could be tricked into speaking, after searching \\nold records and questioning Muggle and wizard \\nwitnesses alike. \\n\\n“Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that \\nRiddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is \\nunderstandable, of course; he had grown up in an \\norphanage and naturally wished to know how he \\ncame to be there. It seems that he searched in vain \\nfor some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in \\nthe trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old \\nschool records, even in the books of Wizarding \\nhistory. Finally he was forced to accept that his father \\nhad never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was \\nthen that he dropped the name forever, assumed the \\nidentity of Lord Voldemort, and began his \\ninvestigations into his previously despised mother’s \\nfamily — the woman whom, you will remember, he \\nhad thought could not be a witch if she had \\nsuccumbed to the shameful human weakness of \\ndeath. \\n\\n“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ \\nwhich he knew from those who ran the orphanage \\nhad been his mother’s father’s name. Finally, after \\npainstaking research through old books of Wizarding \\nfamilies, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s \\nsurviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he \\nleft the orphanage to which he returned annually and \\nset off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if \\nyou will stand ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 408 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again \\nholding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling, \\npearly memory. \\n\\n“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he \\npoured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. “As you \\nwill understand when we have experienced it. Shall \\nwe?” \\n\\nHarry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed \\nobediently until his face sank through the surface of \\nthe memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling \\nthrough nothingness and then landed upon a dirty \\nstone floor in almost total darkness. \\n\\nIt took him several seconds to recognize the place, by \\nwhich time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The \\nGaunts’ house was now more indescribably filthy \\nthan anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was \\nthick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy \\nand rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of \\ncrusted pots. The only light came from a single \\nguttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair \\nand beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes \\nnor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the \\nfire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he \\nwas dead. But then there came a loud knock on the \\ndoor and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his \\nright hand and a short knife in his left. \\n\\nThe door creaked open. There on the threshold, \\nholding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry \\nrecognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and \\nhandsome — the teenage Voldemort. \\n\\nVoldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and \\nthen found the man in the armchair. For a few \\nseconds they looked at each other, then the man \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 409 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstaggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet \\nclattering and tinkling across the floor. \\n\\n“YOU!” he bellowed. “YOU!” \\n\\nAnd he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife \\nheld aloft. \\n\\n“Stop.” \\n\\nRiddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into \\nthe table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He \\nstared at Riddle. There was a long silence while they \\ncontemplated each other. The man broke it. \\n\\n“ You speak it?” \\n\\n“Yes, I speak it,” said Riddle. He moved forward into \\nthe room, allowing the door to swing shut behind \\nhim. Harry could not help but feel a resentful \\nadmiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of fear. His \\nface merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, \\ndisappointment. \\n\\n“Where is Marvolo?” he asked. \\n\\n“Dead,” said the other. “Died years ago, didn’t he?” \\nRiddle frowned. \\n\\n“ Who are you, then?” \\n\\n“I’m Morfin, ain’t 1?” \\n\\n“ Marvolo’ s son?” \\n\\n“ ’Course I am, then ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 410 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better \\nto see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo’s \\nblack-stoned ring on his right hand. \\n\\n“I thought you was that Muggle,” whispered Morfin. \\n\\n“ You look mighty like that Muggle .” \\n\\n“What Muggle?” said Riddle sharply. \\n\\n“That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that \\nMuggle what lives in the big house over the way,” said \\nMorfin, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor \\nbetween them. “You look right like him. Riddle. But \\nhe’s older now, in ’e? He’s older’n you, now I think on \\nit. ...” \\n\\nMorfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still \\nclutching the edge of the table for support. “He come \\nback, see,” he added stupidly. \\n\\nVoldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising \\nhis possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and \\nsaid, “Riddle came back?” \\n\\n“Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth\\\\” \\nsaid Morfin, spitting on the floor again. “Robbed us, \\nmind, before she ran off! Where’s the locket, eh, \\nwhere’s Slytherin’s locket?” \\n\\nVoldemort did not answer. Morfin was working \\nhimself into a rage again; he brandished his knife and \\nshouted, “Dishonored us, she did, that little slut! And \\nwho’re you, coming here and asking questions about \\nall that? It’s over, innit. ... It’s over. ...” \\n\\nHe looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort \\nmoved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness \\nfell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and Morfin ’s \\ncandle, extinguishing everything. ... \\n\\nPage | 411 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore’s fingers closed tightly around Harry’s \\narm and they were soaring back into the present \\nagain. The soft golden light in Dumbledore’s office \\nseemed to dazzle Harry’s eyes after that impenetrable \\ndarkness. \\n\\n“Is that all?” said Harry at once. “Why did it go dark, \\nwhat happened?” \\n\\n“Because Morfin could not remember anything from \\nthat point onward,” said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry \\nback into his seat. “When he awoke next morning, he \\nwas lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvolo’s ring had \\ngone. \\n\\n“Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid \\nwas running along the High Street, screaming that \\nthere were three bodies lying in the drawing room of \\nthe big house: Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and \\nfather. \\n\\n“The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I \\nam aware, they do not know to this day how the \\nRiddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse does not \\nusually leave any sign of damage. ... The exception \\nsits before me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to \\nHarry’s scar. “The Ministry, on the other hand, knew \\nat once that this was a wizard’s murder. They also \\nknew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the \\nvalley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had \\nalready been imprisoned once for attacking one of the \\nmurdered people. \\n\\n“So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not \\nneed to question him, to use Veritaserum or \\nLegilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, \\ngiving details only the murderer could know. He was \\nproud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been \\nawaiting his chance all these years. He handed over \\nPage | 412 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis wand, which was proved at once to have been \\nused to kill the Riddles. And he permitted himself to \\nbe led off to Azkaban without a fight. All that \\ndisturbed him was the fact that his father’s ring had \\ndisappeared. ‘He’ll kill me for losing it,’ he told his \\ncaptors over and over again. ‘He’ll kill me for losing \\nhis ring. ’ And that, apparently, was all he ever said \\nagain. He lived out the remainder of his life in \\nAzkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last \\nheirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside \\nthe other poor souls who have expired within its \\nwalls.” \\n\\n“So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said \\nHarry, sitting up straight. \\n\\n“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. “We have no \\nmemories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly \\nsure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, \\ntook his wand, and proceeded across the valley to ‘the \\nbig house over the way. ’ There he murdered the \\nMuggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, \\nand, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, \\nthus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line \\nand revenging himself upon the father who never \\nwanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, \\nperformed the complex bit of magic that would \\nimplant a false memory in his uncle’s mind, laid \\nMorfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, \\npocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.” \\n\\n“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?” \\n\\n“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full \\nand boastful confession.” \\n\\n“But he had this real memory in him all the time!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 413 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to \\ncoax it out of him,” said Dumbledore, “and why \\nshould anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind \\nwhen he had already confessed to the crime? \\n\\nHowever, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the \\nlast weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting \\nto discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s \\npast. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I \\nsaw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure \\nMorfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry \\nreached their decision, however, Morfin had died.” \\n\\n“But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that \\nVoldemort had done all that to Morfin?” Harry asked \\nangrily. “He was underage at the time, wasn’t he? I \\nthought they could detect underage magic!” \\n\\n“You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not \\nthe perpetrator: You will remember that you were \\nblamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, \\nin fact, cast by — ” \\n\\n“Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. \\n\\n“So if you’re underage and you do magic inside an \\nadult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t \\nknow?” \\n\\n“They will certainly be unable to tell who performed \\nthe magic,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the \\nlook of great indignation on Harry’s face. “They rely \\non witch and wizard parents to enforce their \\noffspring’s obedience while within their walls.” \\n\\n“Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry. “Look what \\nhappened here, look what happened to Morfin!” \\n\\n“I agree,” said Dumbledore. “Whatever Morfin was, he \\ndid not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 414 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe had not committed. But it is getting late, and I \\nwant you to see this other memory before we part. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore took from an inside pocket another \\ncrystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, \\nremembering that Dumbledore had said it was the \\nmost important one he had collected. Harry noticed \\nthat the contents proved difficult to empty into the \\nPensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did \\nmemories go bad? \\n\\n“This will not take long,” said Dumbledore, when he \\nhad finally emptied the phial. “We shall be back \\nbefore you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Harry fell again through the silver surface, \\nlanding this time right in front of a man he recognized \\nat once. \\n\\nIt was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was \\nso used to him bald that he found the sight of \\nSlughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite \\ndisconcerting; it looked as though he had had his \\nhead thatched, though there was already a shiny \\nGalleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, \\nless massive than it was these days, was gingery- \\nblond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn \\nHarry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly \\nembroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of \\nstrain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he \\nwas sitting well back in a comfortable winged \\narmchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, \\nthe other searching through a box of crystalized \\npineapple. \\n\\nHarry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside \\nhim and saw that they were standing in Slughorn ’s \\noffice. Half a dozen boys were sitting around \\n\\nPage | 415 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and \\nall in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at \\nonce. His was the most handsome face and he looked \\nthe most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay \\nnegligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, \\nHarry saw that he was wearing Marvolo’s gold-and- \\nblack ring; he had already killed his father. \\n\\n“Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is \\nretiring?” he asked. \\n\\n“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said \\nSlughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger \\nat Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by \\nwinking. “I must say, I’d like to know where you get \\nyour information, boy, more knowledgeable than half \\nthe staff, you are.” \\n\\nRiddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him \\nadmiring looks. \\n\\n“What with your uncanny ability to know things you \\nshouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the people who \\nmatter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, \\nyou’re quite right, it is my favorite — ” \\n\\nAs several of the boys tittered, something very odd \\nhappened. The whole room was suddenly filled with a \\nthick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but \\nthe face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside \\nhim. Then Slughorn ’s voice rang out through the \\nmist, unnaturally loudly, “ You’ll go wrong, boy, mark \\nmy words.” \\n\\nThe fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and \\nyet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody \\nlook as though anything unusual had just happened. \\nBewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 416 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven \\no’clock. \\n\\n“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said \\nSlughorn. “You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all be \\nin trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow \\nor it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.” \\n\\nSlughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and \\ncarried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys \\nfiled out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry \\ncould tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be \\nlast in the room with Slughorn. \\n\\n“Look sharp, Tom,” said Slughorn, turning around \\nand finding him still present. “You don’t want to be \\ncaught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect ...” \\n\\n“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.” \\n\\n“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. ...” \\n\\n“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about \\nHorcruxes?” \\n\\nAnd it happened all over again: The dense fog filled \\nthe room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or \\nVoldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely \\nbeside him. Then Slughorn’s voice boomed out again, \\njust as it had done before. \\n\\n“I don’t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn’t \\ntell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don’t \\nlet me catch you mentioning them again\\\\” \\n\\n“Well, that’s that,” said Dumbledore placidly beside \\nHarry. “Time to go.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 417 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Harry’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, \\nback onto the mg in front of Dumbledore’s desk. \\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s all there is?” said Harry blankly. \\n\\nDumbledore had said that this was the most \\nimportant memory of all, but he could not see what \\nwas so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and \\nthe fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was \\nodd, but other than that nothing seemed to have \\nhappened except that Voldemort had asked a \\nquestion and failed to get an answer. \\n\\n“As you might have noticed,” said Dumbledore, \\nreseating himself behind his desk, “that memory has \\nbeen tampered with.” \\n\\n“Tampered with?” repeated Harry, sitting back down \\ntoo. \\n\\n“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Professor Slughorn \\nhas meddled with his own recollections.” \\n\\n“But why would he do that?” \\n\\n“Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he \\nremembers,” said Dumbledore. “He has tried to \\nrework the memory to show himself in a better light, \\nobliterating those parts which he does not wish me to \\nsee. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, \\nand that is all to the good, for it shows that the true \\nmemory is still there beneath the alterations. \\n\\n“And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, \\nHarry. It will be your job to persuade Professor \\nSlughorn to divulge the real memory, which will \\nundoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information \\nof all.” \\n\\nPage | 418 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry stared at him. \\n\\n“But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as \\nrespectful as possible, “you don’t need me — you \\ncould use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum. ...” \\n\\n“Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who \\nwill be expecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is \\nmuch more accomplished at Occlumency than poor \\nMorfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has \\nnot carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever \\nsince I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a \\nrecollection. \\n\\n“No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the \\ntruth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do \\nmuch more harm than good; I do not wish him to \\nleave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like \\nthe rest of us, and I believe that you are the one \\nperson who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It \\nis most important that we secure the true memory, \\nHarry. ... How important, we will only know when we \\nhave seen the real thing. So, good luck ... and good \\nnight.” \\n\\nA little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry \\ngot to his feet quickly. “Good night, sir.” \\n\\nAs he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly \\nheard Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy \\nshould be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied \\nDumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical \\ncry. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 419 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBIRTHDAY SURPRISES \\n\\nThe next day Harry confided in both Ron and \\nHermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, \\nthough separately, for Hermione still refused to \\nremain in Ron’s presence longer than it took to give \\nhim a contemptuous look. \\n\\nRon thought that Harry was unlikely to have any \\ntrouble with Slughorn at all. \\n\\n“He loves you,” he said over breakfast, waving an airy \\nforkful of fried egg. “Won’t refuse you anything, will \\nhe? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after \\nclass this afternoon and ask him.” \\n\\nHermione, however, took a gloomier view. “He must \\nbe determined to hide what really happened if \\nDumbledore couldn’t get it out of him,” she said in a \\nlow voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy \\ncourtyard at break. “Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I’ve \\nnever even heard of them. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 420 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“You haven’t?” Harry was disappointed; he had hoped \\nthat Hermione might have been able to give him a \\nclue as to what Horcruxes were. \\n\\n\\n\\n“They must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why \\nwould Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I \\nthink it’s going to be difficult to get the information, \\nHarry, you’ll have to be very careful about how you \\napproach Slughorn, think out a strategy. ...” \\n\\n“Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions \\nthis afternoon. ...” \\n\\n“Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you’d better do it,” \\nshe said, flaring up at once. “After all, when has Won- \\nWon’s judgment ever been faulty?” \\n\\n“Hermione, can’t you — ?” \\n\\n“iVo!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving \\nHarry alone and ankle-deep in snow. \\n\\nPotions lessons were uncomfortable enough these \\ndays, seeing as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to \\nshare a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron \\naround the table so that she was close to Ernie, and \\nignored both Harry and Ron. \\n\\n“What’ve you done?” Ron muttered to Harry, looking \\nat Hermione ’s haughty profile. \\n\\nBut before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling \\nfor silence from the front of the room. \\n\\n“Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots \\nof work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott’s \\nThird Law ... who can tell me — ? But Miss Granger \\ncan, of course!” \\n\\nPage | 421 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione recited at top speed: “Golpalott’s-Third- \\nLaw-states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison- \\nwill-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes- \\nfor-each-of-the-separate-components.” \\n\\n“Precisely!” beamed Slughorn. “Ten points for \\nGryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott’s Third Law as \\ntrue ...” \\n\\nHarry was going to have to take Slughorn ’s word for it \\nthat Golpalott’s Third Law was true, because he had \\nnot understood any of it. Nobody apart from \\nHermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said \\nnext either. \\n\\n\"... which means, of course, that assuming we have \\nachieved correct identification of the potion’s \\ningredients by Scarpin’s Revelaspell, our primary aim \\nis not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes \\nto those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find \\nthat added component that will, by an almost \\nalchemical process, transform these disparate \\nelements — ” \\n\\nRon was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half \\nopen, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced \\nPotion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no \\nlonger rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble \\nwhen he failed to grasp what was going on. \\n\\n\"... and so,” finished Slughorn, “I want each of you to \\ncome and take one of these phials from my desk. You \\nare to create an antidote for the poison within it \\nbefore the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don’t \\nforget your protective gloves!” \\n\\nHermione had left her stool and was halfway toward \\nSlughorn ’s desk before the rest of the class had \\nrealized it was time to move, and by the time Harry, \\n\\nPage | 422 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon, and Ernie returned to the table, she had already \\ntipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and \\nwas kindling a fire underneath it. \\n\\n“It’s a shame that the Prince won’t be able to help you \\nmuch with this, Harry,” she said brightly as she \\nstraightened up. “You have to understand the \\nprinciples involved this time. No shortcuts or cheats!” \\n\\nAnnoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken \\nfrom Slughorn’s desk, which was a garish shade of \\npink, tipped it into his cauldron, and lit a fire \\nunderneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what \\nhe was supposed to do next. He glanced around at \\nRon, who was now standing there looking rather \\ngormless, having copied everything Harry had done. \\n\\n“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” Ron \\nmuttered to Harry. \\n\\nHarry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion- \\nMaking and turned to the chapter on antidotes. There \\nwas Golpalott’s Third Law, stated word for word as \\nHermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating \\nnote in the Prince’s hand to explain what it meant. \\nApparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no \\ndifficulty understanding it. \\n\\n“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily. \\n\\nHermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically \\nover her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy \\nthe spell she was doing because she was now so good \\nat nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say \\nthe words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was \\nmuttering, “Specialis Reveliol” over his cauldron, \\nwhich sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron \\nhastened to imitate him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 423 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt took Harry only five minutes to realize that his \\nreputation as the best potion-maker in the class was \\ncrashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered \\nhopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the \\ndungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he \\nusually did, and instead had withdrawn his head \\nhastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs \\noverwhelmed him. Hermione’s expression could not \\nhave been any smugger; she had loathed being \\noutperformed in every Potions class. She was now \\ndecanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of \\nher poison into ten different crystal phials. More to \\navoid watching this irritating sight than anything \\nelse, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince’s book and \\nturned a few pages with unnecessary force. \\n\\nAnd there it was, scrawled right across a long list of \\nantidotes: \\n\\nJust shove a bezoar down their throats. \\n\\nHarry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn’t he \\nonce, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn’t Snape \\nmentioned them in their first-ever Potions lesson? “A \\nstone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will \\nprotect from most poisons.” \\n\\nIt was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and \\nhad Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not \\nhave dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate \\nmeasures. He hastened toward the store cupboard \\nand rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn \\nhorns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at \\nthe very back, a small cardboard box on which had \\nbeen scribbled the word bezoars. \\n\\nHe opened the box just as Slughorn called, “Two \\nminutes left, everyone!” Inside were half a dozen \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 424 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshriveled brown objects, looking more like dried-up \\nkidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the \\nbox back in the cupboard, and hurried back to his \\ncauldron. \\n\\n“Time’s ... UP!” called Slughorn genially. “Well, let’s \\nsee how you’ve done! Blaise ... what have you got for \\nme?” \\n\\nSlowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining \\nthe various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, \\nalthough Hermione was trying to cram a few more \\ningredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached \\nher. Ron had given up completely, and was merely \\ntrying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing \\nfrom his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the \\nbezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand. \\n\\nSlughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie’s \\npotion and passed on to Ron’s with a grimace. He did \\nnot linger over Ron’s cauldron, but backed away \\nswiftly, retching slightly. \\n\\n“And you, Harry,” he said. “What have you got to \\nshow me?” \\n\\nHarry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his \\npalm. \\n\\nSlughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. \\nHarry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going \\nto shout at him. Then he threw back his head and \\nroared with laughter. \\n\\n“You’ve got nerve, boy!” he boomed, taking the bezoar \\nand holding it up so that the class could see it. “Oh, \\nyou’re like your mother. ... Well, I can’t fault you. ... A \\nbezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these \\npotions!” \\n\\nPage | 425 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her \\nnose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, \\ncomprising fifty-two ingredients, including a chunk of \\nher own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, \\nwho had eyes for nobody but Harry. \\n\\n“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, \\nHarry?” she asked through gritted teeth. \\n\\n“That’s the individual spirit a real potion-maker \\nneeds!” said Slughorn happily, before Harry could \\nreply. “Just like his mother, she had the same \\nintuitive grasp of potion-making, it’s undoubtedly \\nfrom Lily he gets it. ... Yes, Harry, yes, if you’ve got a \\nbezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick . . . \\nalthough as they don’t work on everything, and are \\npretty rare, it’s still worth knowing how to mix \\nantidotes. ...” \\n\\nThe only person in the room looking angrier than \\nHermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, \\nhad spilled something that looked like cat-sick over \\nhimself. Before either of them could express their fury \\nthat Harry had come top of the class by not doing any \\nwork, however, the bell rang. \\n\\n“Time to pack up!” said Slughorn. “And an extra ten \\npoints to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!” \\n\\nStill chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the \\nfront of the dungeon. \\n\\nHarry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount \\nof time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione \\nwished him luck as they left; both looked rather \\nannoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only \\ntwo left in the room. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 426 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come on, now, Harry, you’ll be late for your next \\nlesson,” said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold \\nclasps shut on his dragon- skin briefcase. \\n\\n“Sir,” said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of \\nVoldemort, “I wanted to ask you something.” \\n\\n“Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away. ...” \\n\\n“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about \\nHorcruxes?” \\n\\nSlughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in \\nupon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, \\n\\n“What did you say?” \\n\\n“I asked whether you know anything about \\nHorcruxes, sir. You see — ” \\n\\n“Dumbledore put you up to this,” whispered \\nSlughorn. His voice had changed completely. It was \\nnot genial anymore, but shocked, terrified. He \\nfumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a \\nhandkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. \\n“Dumbledore’s shown you that — that memory. Well? \\nHasn’t he?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was \\nbest not to lie. \\n\\n“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing \\nat his white face. “Of course ... well, if you’ve seen \\nthat memory, Harry, you’ll know that I don’t know \\nanything — anything” — he repeated the word \\nforcefully — “about Horcruxes.” \\n\\nHe seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his \\nhandkerchief back into his pocket, and marched to \\nthe dungeon door. \\n\\nPage | 427 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sir,” said Harry desperately, “I just thought there \\nmight be a bit more to the memory — ” \\n\\n“Did you?” said Slughorn. “Then you were wrong, \\nweren’t you? WRONG!” \\n\\nHe bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say \\nanother word, slammed the dungeon door behind \\nhim. \\n\\nNeither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic \\nwhen Harry told them of this disastrous interview. \\nHermione was still seething at the way Harry had \\ntriumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was \\nresentful that Harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too. \\n\\n“It would’ve just looked stupid if we’d both done it!” \\nsaid Harry irritably. “Look, I had to try and soften him \\nup so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn’t I? Oh, \\nwill you get a grip\\\\” he added in exasperation, as Ron \\nwinced at the sound of the name. \\n\\nInfuriated by his failure and by Ron’s and Hermione’s \\nattitudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over \\nwhat to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for \\nthe time being, he would let Slughorn think that he \\nhad forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best \\nto lull him into a false sense of security before \\nreturning to the attack. \\n\\nWhen Harry did not question Slughorn again, the \\nPotions master reverted to his usual affectionate \\ntreatment of him, and appeared to have put the \\nmatter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to \\none of his little evening parties, determined to accept \\nthis time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch \\npractice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation \\narrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: \\nNeither of them had received an invitation and nor, as \\nPage | 428 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfar as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not \\nhelp wondering whether this meant that Slughorn \\nwas not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply \\ndetermined to give Harry no additional opportunities \\nto question him. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione \\nfor the first time in living memory. She was so \\nshocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at \\nHarry for his trick with the bezoar. \\n\\n“I haven’t found one single explanation of what \\nHorcruxes do!” she told him. “Not a single one! I’ve \\nbeen right through the restricted section and even in \\nthe most horrible books, where they tell you how to \\nbrew the most gruesome potions — nothing! All I \\ncould find was this, in the introduction to Magick \\nMoste Evile — listen — ‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of \\nmagical inventions, we shall not speak nor give \\ndirection. ...’I mean, why mention it then?” she said \\nimpatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a \\nghostly wail. “Oh, shut up,” she snapped, stuffing it \\nback into her bag. \\n\\nThe snow melted around the school as February \\narrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. \\nPurplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and a \\nconstant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery \\nand muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth \\nyears’ first Apparition lesson, which was scheduled \\nfor a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons \\nwould be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead \\nof in the grounds. \\n\\nWhen Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron \\nhad come down with Lavender), they found that the \\ntables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high \\nwindows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly \\nabove them as they assembled in front of Professors \\nPage | 429 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMcGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and Sprout — the \\nHeads of Houses — and a small wizard whom Harry \\ntook to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry. \\nHe was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, \\nwispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a \\nsingle gust of wind might blow him away. Harry \\nwondered whether constant disappearances and \\nreappearances had somehow diminished his \\nsubstance, or whether this frail build was ideal for \\nanyone wishing to vanish. \\n\\n“Good morning,” said the Ministry wizard, when all \\nthe students had arrived and the Heads of Houses \\nhad called for quiet. “My name is Wilkie Twycross and \\nI shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the \\nnext twelve weeks. I hope to be able to prepare you for \\nyour Apparition Tests in this time — ” \\n\\n“Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor \\nMcGonagall. \\n\\nEverybody looked around. Malfoy had flushed a dull \\npink; he looked furious as he stepped away from \\nCrabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having \\na whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at \\nSnape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry \\nstrongly suspected that this was less because of \\nMalfoy’s rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had \\nreprimanded one of his House. \\n\\n“ — by which time, many of you may be ready to take \\nyour tests,” Twycross continued, as though there had \\nbeen no interruption. \\n\\n“As you may know, it is usually impossible to \\nApparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The \\nheadmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely \\nwithin the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable \\nyou to practice. May I emphasize that you will not be \\nPage | 430 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nable to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and \\nthat you would be unwise to try. \\n\\n“I would like each of you to place yourselves now so \\nthat you have a clear five feet of space in front of \\nyou.” \\n\\nThere was a great scrambling and jostling as people \\nseparated, banged into each other, and ordered \\nothers out of their space. The Heads of Houses moved \\namong the students, marshaling them into position \\nand breaking up arguments. \\n\\n“Harry, where are you going?” demanded Hermione. \\n\\nBut Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly \\nthrough the crowd, past the place where Professor \\nFlitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a \\nfew Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the \\nfront, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the \\nHufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie \\nMacmillan, he managed to position himself right at \\nthe back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who \\nwas taking advantage of the general upheaval to \\ncontinue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet \\naway and looking mutinous. \\n\\n“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” Malfoy \\nshot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind \\nhim. “It’s taking longer than I thought it would.” \\n\\nCrabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to \\nsecond-guess what he was going to say. “Look, it’s \\nnone of your business what I’m doing, Crabbe, you \\nand Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a lookout!” \\n\\n“I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want them to \\nkeep a lookout for me,” Harry said, just loud enough \\nfor Malfoy to hear him. \\n\\nPage | 431 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMalfoy spun around on the spot, his hand flying to \\nhis wand, but at that precise moment the four Heads \\nof House shouted, “Quiet!” and silence fell again. \\nMalfoy turned slowly to face the front again. \\n\\n“Thank you,” said Twycross. “Now then ...” \\n\\nHe waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops \\ninstantly appeared on the floor in front of every \\nstudent. \\n\\n“The important things to remember when Apparating \\nare the three D’s!” said Twycross. “Destination, \\nDetermination, Deliberation! \\n\\n“Step one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired \\ndestination,” said Twycross. “In this case, the interior \\nof your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that \\ndestination now.” \\n\\nEverybody looked around furtively to check that \\neveryone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily \\ndid as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular \\npatch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried \\nhard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, \\nas he couldn’t stop puzzling over what Malfoy was \\ndoing that needed lookouts. \\n\\n“Step two,” said Twycross, “focus your determination \\nto occupy the visualized space! Let your yearning to \\nenter it flood from your mind to every particle of your \\nbody!” \\n\\nHarry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to \\nhis left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop \\nso hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as \\nthough he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. \\nHarry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze \\nto his own hoop. \\n\\nPage | 432 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Step three,” called Twycross, “and only when I give \\nthe command ... Turn on the spot, feeling your way \\ninto nothingness, moving with deliberation ,! On my \\ncommand, now . . . one — ” \\n\\nHarry glanced around again; lots of people were \\nlooking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate \\nso quickly. \\n\\n“— two — ” \\n\\nHarry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he \\nhad already forgotten what the three D’s stood for. \\n\\nTHREE!” \\n\\nHarry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell \\nover. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was \\nsuddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on \\nhis back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had \\ndone a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and \\nlooked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of \\nDean Thomas roaring with laughter at him. \\n\\n“Never mind, never mind,” said Twycross dryly, who \\ndid not seem to have expected anything better. \\n\\n“Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original \\npositions. ...” \\n\\nThe second attempt was no better than the first. The \\nthird was just as bad. Not until the fourth did \\nanything exciting happen. There was a horrible \\nscreech of pain and everybody looked around, \\nterrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in \\nher hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away \\nwhere she had started. \\n\\nThe Heads of House converged on her; there was a \\ngreat bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared \\n\\nPage | 433 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but \\nlooking horrified. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,” \\nsaid Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, “occurs when \\nthe mind is insufficiently determined. You must \\nconcentrate continuously upon your destination , and \\nmove, without haste, but with deliberation ... thus.” \\n\\nTwycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the \\nspot with his arms outstretched, and vanished in a \\nswirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. \\n\\n“Remember the three D’s,” he said, “and try again ... \\none — two — three — ” \\n\\nBut an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the \\nmost interesting thing that had happened. Twycross \\ndid not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his \\nneck, he merely said, “Until next Saturday, \\neverybody, and do not forget: Destination. \\nDetermination. Deliberation.” \\n\\nWith that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, \\nand walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor \\nMcGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began \\nmoving toward the entrance hall. \\n\\n“How did you do?” asked Ron, hurrying toward Harry. \\n“I think I felt something the last time I tried — a kind \\nof tingling in my feet.” \\n\\n“I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,” said \\na voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, \\nsmirking. \\n\\n“I didn’t feel anything,” said Harry, ignoring this \\ninterruption. “But I don’t care about that now — ” \\n\\nPage | 434 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What d’you mean, you don’t care? Don’t you want to \\nlearn to Apparate?” said Ron incredulously. \\n\\n“I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,” said Harry, \\nglancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, \\nand speeding up as they came into the entrance hall. \\n“Look, hurry up, will you, there’s something I want to \\ndo. ...” \\n\\nPerplexed, Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor \\nTower at a run. They were temporarily detained by \\nPeeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor \\nshut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they \\nset fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply \\nturned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts. \\nWithin five minutes, they were climbing through the \\nportrait hole. \\n\\n“Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then?” \\nasked Ron, panting slightly. \\n\\n“Up here,” said Harry, and he crossed the common \\nroom and led the way through the door to the boys’ \\nstaircase. \\n\\nTheir dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He \\nflung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, \\nwhile Ron watched impatiently. \\n\\n“Harry ...” \\n\\n“Malfoy ’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was \\narguing with Crabbe just now. I want to know — \\naha.” \\n\\nHe had found it, a folded square of apparently blank \\nparchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped \\nwith the tip of his wand. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 435 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy \\nis anyway.” \\n\\nAt once, the Marauder’s Map appeared on the \\nparchment’s surface. Here was a detailed plan of \\nevery one of the castle’s floors and, moving around it, \\nthe tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of the \\ncastle’s occupants. \\n\\n“Help me find Malfoy,” said Harry urgently. \\n\\nHe laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned \\nover it, searching. \\n\\n“There!” said Ron, after a minute or so. “He’s in the \\nSlytherin common room, look . . . with Parkinson and \\nZabini and Crabbe and Goyle ...” \\n\\nHarry looked down at the map, disappointed, but \\nrallied almost at once. \\n\\n“Well, I’m keeping an eye on him from now on,” he \\nsaid firmly. “And the moment I see him lurking \\nsomewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch \\noutside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and \\noff to find out what he’s — ” \\n\\nHe broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing \\nwith him a strong smell of singed material, and began \\nrummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants. \\n\\nDespite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry \\nhad no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. \\nAlthough he consulted the map as often as he could, \\nsometimes making unnecessary visits to the \\nbathroom between lessons to search it, he did not \\nonce see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he \\nspotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle \\non their own more often than usual, sometimes \\nPage | 436 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nremaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at \\nthese times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, \\nbut impossible to locate on the map at all. This was \\nmost mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that \\nMalfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but \\ncould not see how he could be doing it, given the very \\nhigh level of security now operating within the castle. \\nHe could only suppose that he was missing Malfoy \\namongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the \\nmap. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle \\nappeared to be going their different ways when they \\nwere usually inseparable, these things happened as \\npeople got older — Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected \\nsadly, were living proof. \\n\\nFebruary moved toward March with no change in the \\nweather except that it became windy as well as wet. \\n\\nTo general indignation, a sign went up on all common \\nroom notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade \\nhad been canceled. Ron was furious. \\n\\n“It was on my birthday!” he said. “I was looking \\nforward to that!” \\n\\n“Not a big surprise, though, is it?” said Harry. “Not \\nafter what happened to Katie.” \\n\\nShe had still not returned from St. Mungo’s. What \\nwas more, further disappearances had been reported \\nin the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of \\nstudents at Hogwarts. \\n\\n“But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid \\nApparition!” said Ron grumpily. “Big birthday treat ...” \\n\\nThree lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult \\nas ever, though a few more people had managed to \\nSplinch themselves. Frustration was running high \\nand there was a certain amount of ill-feeling toward \\n\\nPage | 437 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWilkie Twycross and his three D’s, which had inspired \\na number of nicknames for him, the politest of which \\nwere Dogbreath and Dunghead. \\n\\n“Happy birthday, Ron,” said Harry, when they were \\nwoken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean \\nleaving noisily for breakfast. “Have a present.” \\n\\nHe threw the package across onto Ron’s bed, where it \\njoined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, \\nhave been delivered by house-elves in the night. \\n\\n“Cheers,” said Ron drowsily and, as he ripped off the \\npaper, Harry got out of bed, opened his own trunk, \\nand began rummaging in it for the Marauder’s Map, \\nwhich he hid after every use. He turfed out half the \\ncontents of his trunk before he found it hiding \\nbeneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still \\nkeeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. \\n\\n“Right,” he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, \\ntapping it quietly and murmuring, “ I solemnly swear \\nthat I am up to no good,” so that Neville, who was \\npassing the foot of his bed at the time, would not \\nhear. \\n\\n“Nice one, Harry!” said Ron enthusiastically, waving \\nthe new pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves Harry had \\ngiven him. \\n\\n“No problem,” said Harry absentmindedly, as he \\nsearched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. \\n“Hey ... I don’t think he’s in his bed. ...” \\n\\nRon did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping \\npresents, every now and then letting out an \\nexclamation of pleasure. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 438 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Seriously good haul this year!” he announced, \\nholding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols \\naround the edge and tiny moving stars instead of \\nhands. “See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I \\nthink I’ll come of age next year too. ...” \\n\\n“Cool,” muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance \\nbefore peering more closely at the map. Where was \\nMalfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table \\nin the Great Hall, eating breakfast. ... He was \\nnowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study. ... \\nHe wasn’t in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital \\nwing. ... \\n\\n“Want one?” said Ron thickly, holding out a box of \\nChocolate Cauldrons. \\n\\n“No thanks,” said Harry, looking up. “Malfoy’s gone \\nagain!” \\n\\n“Can’t have done,” said Ron, stuffing a second \\nCauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get \\ndressed. “Come on, if you don’t hurry up, you’ll have \\nto Apparate on an empty stomach. ... Might make it \\neasier, I suppose ...” Ron looked thoughtfully at the \\nbox of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and \\nhelped himself to a third. \\n\\nHarry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, \\n“Mischief managed,” though it hadn’t been, and got \\ndressed, thinking hard. There had to be an \\nexplanation for Malfoy’s periodic disappearances, but \\nhe simply could not think what it could be. The best \\nway of finding out would be to tail him, but even with \\nthe Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea: \\nHarry had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework, \\nand Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around \\nschool all day without his absence being remarked \\nupon. \\n\\nPage | 439 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ready?” he said to Ron. \\n\\nHe was halfway to the dormitory door when he \\nrealized that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on \\nhis bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window \\nwith a strangely unfocused look on his face. \\n\\n“Ron? Breakfast.” \\n\\n“I’m not hungry.” \\n\\nHarry stared at him. \\n\\n“I thought you just said — ?” \\n\\n“Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed Ron, \\n“but I don’t want to eat.” \\n\\nHarry scrutinized him suspiciously. \\n\\n“You’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, \\nhaven’t you?” \\n\\n“It’s not that,” Ron sighed again. “You ... you wouldn’t \\nunderstand.” \\n\\n“Fair enough,” said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he \\nturned to open the door. \\n\\n“Harry!” said Ron suddenly. \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“Harry, I can’t stand it!” \\n\\n“You can’t stand what?” asked Harry, now starting to \\nfeel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and \\nlooked as though he was about to be sick. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 440 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t stop thinking about her!” said Ron hoarsely. \\n\\nHarry gaped at him. He had not expected this and \\nwas not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might \\nbe, but if Ron started calling Lavender “Lav-Lav,” he \\nwould have to put his foot down. \\n\\n“Why does that stop you having breakfast?” Harry \\nasked, trying to inject a note of common sense into \\nthe proceedings. \\n\\n“I don’t think she knows I exist,” said Ron with a \\ndesperate gesture. \\n\\n“She definitely knows you exist,” said Harry, \\nbewildered. “She keeps snogging you, doesn’t she?” \\n\\nRon blinked. “Who are you talking about?” \\n\\n“Who are you talking about?” said Harry, with an \\nincreasing sense that all reason had dropped out of \\nthe conversation. \\n\\n“Romilda Vane,” said Ron softly, and his whole face \\nseemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a \\nray of purest sunlight. \\n\\nThey stared at each other for almost a whole minute, \\nbefore Harry said, “This is a joke, right? You’re \\njoking.” \\n\\n“I think ... Harry, I think I love her,” said Ron in a \\nstrangled voice. \\n\\n“Okay,” said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better \\nlook at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, \\n“okay... Say that again with a straight face.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 441 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I love her,” repeated Ron breathlessly. “Have you \\nseen her hair, it’s all black and shiny and silky ... and \\nher eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her — ” \\n\\n“This is really funny and everything,” said Harry \\nimpatiently, “but joke’s over, all right? Drop it.” \\n\\nHe turned to leave; he had got two steps toward the \\ndoor when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. \\nStaggering, he looked around. Ron’s fist was drawn \\nright back; his face was contorted with rage; he was \\nabout to strike again. \\n\\nHarry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his \\npocket and the incantation sprang to mind without \\nconscious thought: Levicorpus\\\\ \\n\\nRon yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once \\nmore; he dangled helplessly, upside down, his robes \\nhanging off him. \\n\\n“ What was that for?” Harry bellowed. \\n\\n“You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!” \\nshouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the \\nface as all the blood rushed to his head. \\n\\n“This is insane!” said Harry. “What’s got into — ?” \\n\\nAnd then he saw the box lying open on Ron’s bed, \\nand the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding \\ntroll. \\n\\n“Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?” \\n\\n“They were a birthday present!” shouted Ron, \\nrevolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. \\n\\n“I offered you one, didn’t I?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 442 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You just picked them up off the floor, didn’t you?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“They’d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!” \\n\\n“They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you \\nunderstand? They were mine, I chucked them out of \\nmy trunk when I was looking for the map, they’re the \\nChocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before \\nChristmas, and they’re all spiked with love potion!” \\n\\nBut only one word of this seemed to have registered \\nwith Ron. \\n\\n“Romilda?” he repeated. “Did you say Romilda? Harry \\n— do you know her? Can you introduce me?” \\n\\nHarry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now \\nlooked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong \\ndesire to laugh. A part of him — the part closest to \\nhis throbbing right ear — was quite keen on the idea \\nof letting Ron down and watching him run amok until \\nthe effects of the potion wore off. . . . But on the other \\nhand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not \\nbeen himself when he had attacked, and Harry \\nthought that he would deserve another punching if he \\npermitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda \\nVane. \\n\\n“Yeah, I’ll introduce you,” said Harry, thinking fast. \\n“I’m going to let you down now, okay?” \\n\\nHe sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did \\nhurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet \\nagain, grinning. \\n\\n“She’ll be in Slughorn’s office,” said Harry confidently, \\nleading the way to the door. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 443 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why will she be in there?” asked Ron anxiously, \\nhurrying to keep up. \\n\\n“Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,” said \\nHarry, inventing wildly. \\n\\n“Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her?” said \\nRon eagerly. \\n\\n“Great idea,” said Harry. \\n\\nLavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a \\ncomplication Harry had not foreseen. \\n\\n“You’re late, Won-Won!” she pouted. “I’ve got you a \\nbirthday — ” \\n\\n“Leave me alone,” said Ron impatiently. “Harry’s going \\nto introduce me to Romilda Vane.” \\n\\nAnd without another word to her, he pushed his way \\nout of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an \\napologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned \\nout simply amused, because she looked more \\noffended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut \\nbehind them. \\n\\nHarry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might \\nbe at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the \\nfirst knock, wearing a green velvet dressing gown and \\nmatching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed. \\n\\n“Harry,” he mumbled. “This is very early for a call. ... I \\ngenerally sleep late on a Saturday. ...” \\n\\n“Professor, I’m really sorry to disturb you,” said Harry \\nas quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, \\nattempting to see past Slughorn into his room, “but \\nmy friend Ron’s swallowed a love potion by mistake. \\n\\nPage | 444 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou couldn’t make him an antidote, could you? I’d \\ntake him to Madam Pomfrey, but we’re not supposed \\nto have anything from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and, \\nyou know ... awkward questions ...” \\n\\n“I’d have thought you could have whipped him up a \\nremedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?” asked \\nSlughorn. \\n\\n“Er,” said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that \\nRon was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt \\nto force his way into the room, “well, I’ve never mixed \\nan antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get \\nit right, Ron might’ve done something serious — ” \\n\\nHelpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, “I can’t \\nsee her, Harry — is he hiding her?” \\n\\n“Was this potion within date?” asked Slughorn, now \\neyeing Ron with professional interest. “They can \\nstrengthen, you know, the longer they’re kept.” \\n\\n“That would explain a lot,” panted Harry, now \\npositively wrestling with Ron to keep him from \\nknocking Slughorn over. “It’s his birthday, Professor,” \\nhe added imploringly. \\n\\n“Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,” said Slughorn, \\nrelenting. “I’ve got the necessary here in my bag, it’s \\nnot a difficult antidote. ...” \\n\\nRon burst through the door into Slughorn ’s \\noverheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasseled \\nfootstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry \\naround the neck, and muttered, “She didn’t see that, \\ndid she?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 445 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“She’s not here yet,” said Harry, watching Slughorn \\nopening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of \\nthis and that to a small crystal bottle. \\n\\n“That’s good,” said Ron fervently. “How do I look?” \\n\\n“Very handsome,” said Slughorn smoothly, handing \\nRon a glass of clear liquid. “Now drink that up, it’s a \\ntonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, \\nyou know.” \\n\\n“Brilliant,” said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the \\nantidote down noisily. \\n\\nHarry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron \\nbeamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged \\nand vanished, to be replaced by an expression of \\nutmost horror. \\n\\n“Back to normal, then?” said Harry, grinning. \\nSlughorn chuckled. “Thanks a lot, Professor.” \\n\\n“Don’t mention it, m’boy, don’t mention it,” said \\nSlughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, \\nlooking devastated. “Pick-me-up, that’s what he \\nneeds,” Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a \\ntable loaded with drinks. “I’ve got butterbeer, I’ve got \\nwine, I’ve got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead \\n. . . hmm . . . meant to give that to Dumbledore for \\nChristmas ... ah, well ...” He shrugged. “He can’t miss \\nwhat he’s never had! Why don’t we open it now and \\ncelebrate Mr. Weasley’s birthday? Nothing like a fine \\nspirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe chortled again, and Harry joined in. This was the \\nfirst time he had found himself almost alone with \\nSlughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract \\nthe true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just \\n\\nPage | 446 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkeep Slughorn in a good mood . . . perhaps if they got \\nthrough enough of the oak-matured mead . . . \\n\\n“There you are then,” said Slughorn, handing Harry \\nand Ron a glass of mead each before raising his own. \\n“Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph — ” \\n\\n“Ron — ” whispered Harry. \\n\\nBut Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the \\ntoast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth \\nand swallowed it. \\n\\nThere was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, \\nin which Harry knew there was something terribly \\nwrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not. \\n\\n“ — and may you have many more — ” \\n\\n“Ron\\\\” \\n\\nRon had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his \\nchair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking \\nuncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth, \\nand his eyes were bulging from their sockets. \\n\\n“Professor!” Harry bellowed. “Do something!” \\n\\nBut Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock. Ron \\ntwitched and choked: His skin was turning blue. \\n\\n“What — but — ” spluttered Slughorn. \\n\\nHarry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward \\nSlughorn ’s open potion kit, pulling out jars and \\npouches, while the terrible sound of Ron’s gargling \\nbreath filled the room. Then he found it — the \\nshriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from \\nhim in Potions. \\n\\nPage | 447 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe hurtled back to Ron’s side, wrenched open his \\njaw, and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a \\ngreat shudder, a rattling gasp, and his body became \\nlimp and still. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 448 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nELF TAILS \\n\\n“So, all in all, not one of Ron’s better birthdays?” said \\nFred. \\n\\nIt was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the \\nwindows curtained, the lamps lit. Ron’s was the only \\noccupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were \\nsitting around him; they had spent all day waiting \\noutside the double doors, trying to see inside \\nwhenever somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey \\nhad only let them enter at eight o’clock. Fred and \\nGeorge had arrived at ten past. \\n\\n“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our \\npresent,” said George grimly, putting down a large \\nwrapped gift on Ron’s bedside cabinet and sitting \\nbeside Ginny. \\n\\n“Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was \\nconscious,” said Fred. \\n\\n“There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise \\nhim — ” said George. \\n\\nPage | 449 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“You were in Hogsmeade?” asked Ginny, looking up. \\n\\n“We were thinking of buying Zonko’s,” said Fred \\ngloomily. “A Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat \\nlot of good it’ll do us if you lot aren’t allowed out at \\nweekends to buy our stuff anymore. ... But never \\nmind that now.” \\n\\nHe drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron’s \\npale face. \\n\\n“How exactly did it happen, Harry?” \\n\\nHarry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt \\nlike a hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, \\nto Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione, and to Ginny. \\n\\n\"... and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his \\nbreathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, \\nMcGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they \\nbrought Ron up here. They reckon he’ll be all right. \\nMadam Pomfrey says hell have to stay here a week or \\nso ... keep taking essence of rue ...” \\n\\n“Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,” said \\nGeorge in a low voice. \\n\\n“Lucky there was one in the room,” said Harry, who \\nkept turning cold at the thought of what would have \\nhappened if he had not been able to lay hands on the \\nlittle stone. \\n\\nHermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had \\nbeen exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, \\nwhite-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing \\nand demanded to know what had happened, she had \\ntaken almost no part in Harry and Ginny’s obsessive \\ndiscussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but \\nmerely stood beside them, clench-jawed and \\nPage | 450 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrightened-looking, until at last they had been allowed \\nin to see him. \\n\\n“Do Mum and Dad know?” Fred asked Ginny. \\n\\n“They’ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago \\n— they’re in Dumbledore’s office now, but they’ll be \\nback soon. ...” \\n\\nThere was a pause while they all watched Ron \\nmumble a little in his sleep. \\n\\n“So the poison was in the drink?” said Fred quietly. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry at once; he could think of nothing \\nelse and was glad for the opportunity to start \\ndiscussing it again. “Slughorn poured it out — ” \\n\\n“Would he have been able to slip something into Ron’s \\nglass without you seeing?” \\n\\n“Probably,” said Harry, “but why would Slughorn \\nwant to poison Ron?” \\n\\n“No idea,” said Fred, frowning. “You don’t think he \\ncould have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning \\nto get you?” \\n\\n“Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry?” asked \\nGinny. \\n\\n“I dunno,” said Fred, “but there must be loads of \\npeople who’d like to poison Harry, mustn’t there? The \\nChosen One’ and all that?” \\n\\n“So you think Slughorn ’s a Death Eater?” said Ginny. \\n“Anything’s possible,” said Fred darkly. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 451 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K.

And ...” He thought \\nof the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to \\nextract from Slughorn. “And maybe Voldemort wants \\nhim out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be \\nvaluable to Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“But you said Slughorn had been planning to give \\nthat bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas,” Ginny \\nreminded him. “So the poisoner could just as easily \\nhave been after Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well,” \\nsaid Hermione, speaking for the first time in hours \\nand sounding as though she had a bad head cold. \\n“Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there \\nwas a good chance he’d keep something that tasty for \\nhimself.” \\n\\n“Er-my-nee,” croaked Ron unexpectedly from between \\nthem. \\n\\nThey all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after \\nmuttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely \\nstarted snoring. \\n\\nThe dormitory doors flew open, making them all \\njump: Hagrid came striding toward them, his hair \\nrain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 452 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncrossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy \\ndolphin-sized footprints all over the floor. \\n\\n“Bin in the forest all day!” he panted. “Aragog’s worse, \\nI bin readin’ to him — didn’ get up ter dinner till jus’ \\nnow an’ then Professor Sprout told me abou’ Ron! \\n\\nHow is he?” \\n\\n“Not bad,” said Harry. “They say he’ll be okay.” \\n\\n“No more than six visitors at a time!” said Madam \\nPomfrey, hurrying out of her office. \\n\\n“Hagrid makes six,” George pointed out. \\n\\n“Oh ... yes ...” said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to \\nhave been counting Hagrid as several people due to \\nhis vastness. To cover her confusion, she hurried off \\nto clear up his muddy footprints with her wand. \\n\\n“I don’ believe this,” said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his \\ngreat shaggy head as he stared down at Ron. “Jus’ \\ndon’ believe it ... Look at him lyin’ there. ... Who’d \\nwant ter hurt him, eh?” \\n\\n“That’s just what we were discussing,” said Harry. \\n\\n“We don’t know.” \\n\\n“Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the \\nGryffindor Quidditch team, could they?” said Hagrid \\nanxiously. “Firs’ Katie, now Ron ...” \\n\\n“I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch \\nteam,” said George. \\n\\n“Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got \\naway with it,” said Fred fairly. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 453 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a \\nconnection between the attacks,” said Hermione \\nquietly. \\n\\n“How d’you work that out?” asked Fred. \\n\\n“Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been \\nfatal and weren’t, although that was pure luck. And \\nfor another, neither the poison nor the necklace \\nseems to have reached the person who was supposed \\nto be killed. Of course,” she added broodingly, “that \\nmakes the person behind this even more dangerous \\nin a way, because they don’t seem to care how many \\npeople they finish off before they actually reach their \\nvictim.” \\n\\nBefore anybody could respond to this ominous \\npronouncement, the dormitory doors opened again \\nand Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward. They \\nhad done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron \\nwould make a full recovery on their last visit to the \\nward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Harry and \\nhugged him very tightly. “Dumbledore’s told us how \\nyou saved him with the bezoar,” she sobbed. “Oh, \\nHarry, what can we say? You saved Ginny ... you \\nsaved Arthur ... now you’ve saved Ron ...” \\n\\n“Don’t be ... I didn’t ...” muttered Harry awkwardly. \\n\\n“Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now \\nI stop and think about it,” Mr. Weasley said in a \\nconstricted voice. “Well, all I can say is that it was a \\nlucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in \\nyour compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.” \\n\\nHarry could not think of any reply to this and was \\nalmost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them \\nthat there were only supposed to be six visitors \\naround Ron’s bed; he and Hermione rose at once to \\n\\nPage | 454 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleave and Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron \\nwith his family. \\n\\n“It’s terrible,” growled Hagrid into his beard, as the \\nthree of them walked back along the corridor to the \\nmarble staircase. “All this new security, an’ kids are \\nstill gettin’ hurt. ... Dumbledore’s worried sick. ... He \\ndon’ say much, but I can tell. ...” \\n\\n“Hasn’t he got any ideas, Hagrid?” asked Hermione \\ndesperately. \\n\\n“I ’spect he’s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,” \\nsaid Hagrid. “But he doesn’ know who sent that \\nnecklace nor put poison in that wine, or they’d ’ve bin \\ncaught, wouldn’ they? Wha’ worries me,” said Hagrid, \\nlowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder \\n(Harry, for good measure, checked the ceiling for \\nPeeves), “is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids \\nare bein’ attacked. Chamber o’ Secrets all over again, \\nisn’ it? There’ll be panic, more parents takin’ their \\nkids outta school, an’ nex’ thing yeh know the board \\no’ governors ...” \\n\\nHagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired \\nwoman drifted serenely past, then resumed in a \\nhoarse whisper, \"... the board o’ governors’ll be talkin’ \\nabout shuttin’ us up fer good.” \\n\\n“Surely not?” said Hermione, looking worried. \\n\\n“Gotta see it from their point o’ view,” said Hagrid \\nheavily. “I mean, it’s always bin a bit of a risk sendin’ \\na kid ter Hogwarts, hasn’ it? Yer expect accidents, \\ndon’ yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all \\nlocked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha’s \\ndiff’rent. ’S’no wonder Dumbledore’s angry with Sn — \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 455 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty \\nexpression on what was visible of his face above his \\ntangled black beard. \\n\\n“What?” said Harry quickly. “Dumbledore’s angry with \\nSnape?” \\n\\n“I never said tha’,” said Hagrid, though his look of \\npanic could not have been a bigger giveaway. “Look at \\nthe time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter — ” \\n\\n“Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?” \\n\\nHarry asked loudly. \\n\\n“Shhhh!” said Hagrid, looking both nervous and \\nangry. “Don’ shout stuff like that, Harry, d’yeh wan’ \\nme ter lose me job? Mind, I don’ suppose yeh’d care, \\nwould yeh, not now yeh’ve given up Care of Mag — ” \\n\\n“Don’t try and make me feel guilty, it won’t work!” \\nsaid Harry forcefully. “What’s Snape done?” \\n\\n“I dunno, Harry, I shouldn’ta heard it at all! I — well, I \\nwas cornin’ outta the forest the other evenin’ an’ I \\noverheard ’em talking — well, arguin’. Didn’t like ter \\ndraw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an’ tried \\nnot ter listen, but it was a — well, a heated discussion \\nan’ it wasn’ easy ter block it out.” \\n\\n“Well?” Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his \\nenormous feet uneasily. \\n\\n“Well — I jus’ heard Snape sayin’ Dumbledore took \\ntoo much fer granted an’ maybe he — Snape — didn’ \\nwan’ ter do it anymore — ” \\n\\n“Do what?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 456 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin’ a \\nbit overworked, tha’s all — anyway, Dumbledore told \\nhim flat out he’d agreed ter do it an’ that was all there \\nwas to it. Pretty firm with him. An’ then he said \\nsummat abou’ Snape makin’ investigations in his \\nHouse, in Slytherin. Well, there’s nothin’ strange \\nabou’ that!” Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and \\nHermione exchanged looks full of meaning. “All the \\nHeads o’ Houses were asked ter look inter that \\nnecklace business — ” \\n\\n“Yeah, but Dumbledore ’s not having rows with the \\nrest of them, is he?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Look,” Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in \\nhis hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it \\nsnapped in two. “I know what yeh’re like abou’ Snape, \\nHarry, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter \\nthis than there is.” \\n\\n“Look out,” said Hermione tersely. \\n\\nThey turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus \\nFilch looming over the wall behind them before the \\nman himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his \\njowls aquiver. \\n\\n“Oho!” he wheezed. “Out of bed so late, this’ll mean \\ndetention!” \\n\\n“No it won’, Filch,” said Hagrid shortly. “They’re with \\nme, aren’ they?” \\n\\n“And what difference does that make?” asked Filch \\nobnoxiously. \\n\\n“I’m a ruddy teacher, aren’ I, yeh sneakin’ Squib!” \\nsaid Hagrid, firing up at once. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 457 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with \\nfury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was \\ntwisting herself sinuously around Filch’s skinny \\nankles. \\n\\n“Get goin’,” said Hagrid out of the corner of his \\nmouth. \\n\\nHarry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione \\nboth hurried off; Hagrid’s and Filch’s raised voices \\nechoed behind them as they ran. They passed Peeves \\nnear the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was \\nstreaking happily toward the source of the yelling, \\ncackling and calling, \\n\\nWhen there’s strife and when there’s trouble \\nCall on Peevsie, he’ll make double! \\n\\nThe Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be \\nwoken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to \\nclamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty \\ncommon room. It did not seem that people knew \\nabout Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been \\ninterrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him \\ngood night and set off for the girls’ dormitory. Harry, \\nhowever, remained behind, taking a seat beside the \\nfire and looking down into the dying embers. \\n\\nSo Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all \\nhe had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he \\ntrusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with \\nhim. ... He did not think that Snape had tried hard \\nenough to investigate the Slytherins ... or, perhaps, to \\ninvestigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy? \\n\\nWas it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do \\nanything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, \\nthat he had pretended there was nothing in Harry’s \\nsuspicions? That seemed likely. It might even be that \\n\\nPage | 458 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry \\nfrom their lessons, or from procuring that memory \\nfrom Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it \\nright to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen- \\nyear-olds. ... \\n\\n“There you are, Potter!” \\n\\nHarry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the \\nready. He had been quite convinced that the common \\nroom was empty; he had not been at all prepared for \\na hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant \\nchair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac \\nMcLaggen. \\n\\n“I’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said \\nMcLaggen, disregarding Harry’s drawn wand. \\n\\n“Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking \\nWeasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn’t look \\nlike he’ll be fit for next week’s match.” \\n\\nIt took Harry a few moments to realize what \\nMcLaggen was talking about. \\n\\n“Oh ... right ... Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand \\nback into the belt of his jeans and running a hand \\nwearily through his hair. “Yeah ... he might not make \\nit.” \\n\\n“Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said \\nMcLaggen. \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, I suppose so. ...” \\n\\nHe could not think of an argument against it; after \\nall, McLaggen had certainly performed second-best in \\nthe trials. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 459 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Excellent,” said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. “So \\nwhen’s practice?” \\n\\n“What? Oh ... there’s one tomorrow evening.” \\n\\n“Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk \\nbeforehand. I’ve got some ideas on strategy you might \\nfind useful.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry unenthusiastically. “Well, I’ll hear \\nthem tomorrow, then. I’m pretty tired now ... see you \\n\\n\\n\\nThe news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly \\nnext day, but it did not cause the sensation that \\nKatie’s attack had done. People seemed to think that \\nit might have been an accident, given that he had \\nbeen in the Potions master’s room at the time, and \\nthat as he had been given an antidote immediately \\nthere was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors \\nwere generally much more interested in the upcoming \\nQuidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them \\nwanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on \\nthe Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his \\ncommentary during the opening match against \\nSlytherin. \\n\\nHarry, however, had never been less interested in \\nQuidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with \\nDraco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder’s Map \\nwhenever he got a chance, he sometimes made \\ndetours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had \\nnot yet detected him doing anything out of the \\nordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times \\nwhen Malfoy simply vanished from the map. ... \\n\\nBut Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the \\nproblem, what with Quidditch practice, homework, \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 460 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand the fact that he was now being dogged wherever \\nhe went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. \\n\\nHe could not decide which of them was more \\nannoying. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of \\nhints that he would make a better permanent Keeper \\nfor the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was \\nseeing him play regularly he would surely come \\naround to this way of thinking too; he was also keen \\nto criticize the other players and provide Harry with \\ndetailed training schemes, so that more than once \\nHarry was forced to remind him who was Captain. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to \\ndiscuss Ron, which Harry found almost more wearing \\nthan McLaggen’s Quidditch lectures. At first, \\n\\nLavender had been very annoyed that nobody had \\nthought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing \\n— “I mean, I am his girlfriend!” — but unfortunately \\nshe had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of \\nmemory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats \\nwith him about Ron’s feelings, a most uncomfortable \\nexperience that Harry would have happily forgone. \\n\\n“Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?” \\n\\nHarry asked, after a particularly long interrogation \\nfrom Lavender that took in everything from precisely \\nwhat Ron had said about her new dress robes to \\nwhether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his \\nrelationship with Lavender to be “serious.” \\n\\n“Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and \\nsee him!” said Lavender fretfully. \\n\\n“Is he?” said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron \\nperfectly alert every time he had been up to the \\nhospital wing, both highly interested in the news of \\nDumbledore and Snape’s row and keen to abuse \\nMcLaggen as much as possible. \\n\\nPage | 461 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?” Lavender \\ndemanded suddenly. \\n\\n“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” \\nsaid Harry uncomfortably. \\n\\n“Friends, don’t make me laugh,” said Lavender \\nscornfully. “She didn’t talk to him for weeks after he \\nstarted going out with me! But I suppose she wants to \\nmake up with him now he’s all interesting. ...” \\n\\n“Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?” \\nasked Harry. “Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s \\nMcLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,” said \\nHarry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a \\ndoor pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down \\nthe shortcut that would take him off to Potions where, \\nthankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could \\nfollow him. \\n\\nOn the morning of the Quidditch match against \\nHufflepuff, Harry dropped in on the hospital wing \\nbefore heading down to the pitch. Ron was very \\nagitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down \\nto watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him. \\n\\n“So how’s McLaggen shaping up?” he asked Harry \\nnervously, apparently forgetting that he had already \\nasked the same question twice. \\n\\n“I’ve told you,” said Harry patiently, “he could be \\nworld-class and I wouldn’t want to keep him. He \\nkeeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he \\ncould play every position better than the rest of us. I \\ncan’t wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting \\nshot of people,” Harry added, getting to his feet and \\npicking up his Firebolt, “will you stop pretending to \\nbe asleep when Lavender comes to see you? She’s \\ndriving me mad as well.” \\n\\nPage | 462 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh,” said Ron, looking sheepish. “Yeah. All right.” \\n\\n“If you don’t want to go out with her anymore, just tell \\nher,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Yeah ... well ... it’s not that easy, is it?” said Ron. He \\npaused. “Hermione going to look in before the \\nmatch?” he added casually. \\n\\n“No, she’s already gone down to the pitch with \\nGinny.” \\n\\n“Oh,” said Ron, looking rather glum. “Right. Well, \\ngood luck. Hope you hammer McLag — I mean, \\nSmith.” \\n\\n“I’ll try,” said Harry, shouldering his broom. “See you \\nafter the match.” \\n\\nHe hurried down through the deserted corridors; the \\nwhole school was outside, either already seated in the \\nstadium or heading down toward it. He was looking \\nout of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how \\nmuch wind they were facing, when a noise ahead \\nmade him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking \\ntoward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom \\nlooked sulky and resentful. \\n\\nMalfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave \\na short, humorless laugh and continued walking. \\n\\n“Where ’re you going?” Harry demanded. \\n\\n“Yeah, I’m really going to tell you, because it’s your \\nbusiness, Potter,” sneered Malfoy. “You’d better hurry \\nup, they’ll be waiting for ‘the Chosen Captain’ — ‘the \\nBoy Who Scored’ — whatever they call you these \\ndays.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 463 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared \\nat her. She blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and \\nshe and her friend followed at a trot, turning the \\ncorner and vanishing from view. \\n\\nHarry stood rooted on the spot and watched them \\ndisappear. This was infuriating; he was already \\ncutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet \\nthere was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the \\nschool was absent: Harry’s best chance yet of \\ndiscovering what Malfoy was up to. The silent seconds \\ntrickled past, and Harry remained where he was, \\nfrozen, gazing at the place where Malfoy had \\nvanished. ... \\n\\n“Where have you been?” demanded Ginny, as Harry \\nsprinted into the changing rooms. The whole team \\nwas changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the \\nBeaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously \\nagainst their legs. \\n\\n“I met Malfoy,” Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his \\nscarlet robes over his head. \\n\\n“So?” \\n\\n“So I wanted to know how come he’s up at the castle \\nwith a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is \\ndown here. ...” \\n\\n“Does it matter right now?” \\n\\n“Well, I’m not likely to find out, am I?” said Harry, \\nseizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. \\n“Come on then!” \\n\\nAnd without another word, he marched out onto the \\npitch to deafening cheers and boos. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 464 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every \\nnow and then there were dazzling flashes of bright \\nsunlight. \\n\\n“Tricky conditions!” McLaggen said bracingly to the \\nteam. “Coote, Peakes, you’ll want to fly out of the sun, \\nso they don’t see you coming — ” \\n\\n“I’m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them \\ninstructions,” said Harry angrily. “Just get up by the \\ngoal posts!” \\n\\nOnce McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to \\nCoote and Peakes. \\n\\n“Make sure you do fly out of the sun,” he told them \\ngrudgingly. \\n\\nHe shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and \\nthen, on Madam Hooch’s whistle, kicked off and rose \\ninto the air, higher than the rest of his team, \\nstreaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If \\nhe could catch it good and early, there might be a \\nchance he could get back up to the castle, seize the \\nMarauder’s Map, and find out what Malfoy was doing. \\n\\n\\n\\n“And that’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,” said \\na dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. “He did the \\ncommentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley \\nflew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked \\nlike it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I \\nexpect he regrets that now he’s playing them — oh, \\nlook, he’s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I \\ndo like her, she’s very nice. ...” \\n\\nHarry stared down at the commentator’s podium. \\nSurely nobody in their right mind would have let \\nLuna Lovegood commentate? But even from above \\n\\nPage | 465 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthere was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde hair, \\nnor the necklace of butterbeer corks. ... Beside Luna, \\nProfessor McGonagall was looking slightly \\nuncomfortable, as though she was indeed having \\nsecond thoughts about this appointment. \\n\\n\"... but now that big Hufflepuff player’s got the \\nQuaffle from her, I can’t remember his name, it’s \\nsomething like Bibble — no, Buggins — ” \\n\\n“It’s Cadwallader!” said Professor McGonagall loudly \\nfrom beside Luna. The crowd laughed. \\n\\nHarry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign \\nof it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen \\nhad been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the \\nQuaffle out of her possession, with the result that he \\nhad not noticed the large red ball soaring past his \\nright ear. \\n\\n“McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re \\nsupposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!” \\nbellowed Harry, wheeling around to face his Keeper. \\n\\n“You’re not setting a great example!” McLaggen \\nshouted back, red-faced and furious. \\n\\n“And Harry Potter’s now having an argument with his \\nKeeper,” said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs \\nand Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. \\n“I don’t think that’ll help him find the Snitch, but \\nmaybe it’s a clever ruse. ...” \\n\\nSwearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off \\naround the pitch again, scanning the skies for some \\nsign of the tiny, winged golden ball. \\n\\nGinny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the \\nred-and-gold-clad supporters below something to \\n\\nPage | 466 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making \\nthings level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; \\nshe appeared singularly uninterested in such \\nmundane things as the score, and kept attempting to \\ndraw the crowd’s attention to such things as \\ninterestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that \\nZacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain \\npossession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, \\nwas suffering from something called “Loser’s Lurgy.” \\n\\n“Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!” barked Professor \\nMcGonagall into Luna’s megaphone. \\n\\n“Is it, already?” said Luna vaguely. “Oh, look! The \\nGryffindor Keeper’s got hold of one of the Beater’s \\nbats.” \\n\\nHarry spun around in midair. Sure enough, \\n\\nMcLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had \\npulled Peakes ’s bat from him and appeared to be \\ndemonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an \\noncoming Cadwallader. \\n\\n“ Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal \\nposts!” roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as \\nMcLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and \\nmishit it. \\n\\nA blinding, sickening pain ... a flash of light . . . distant \\nscreams . . . and the sensation of falling down a long \\ntunnel ... \\n\\nAnd the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a \\nremarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking \\nup at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light \\nonto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head \\nawkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking, \\nfreckly, red-haired person. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 467 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nice of you to drop in,” said Ron, grinning. \\n\\nHarry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was \\nin the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo \\nstreaked with crimson. The match must have finished \\nhours ago ... as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. \\nHarry’s head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand \\nand felt a stiff turban of bandages. \\n\\n“What happened?” \\n\\n“Cracked skull,” said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up \\nand pushing him back against his pillows. “Nothing to \\nworry about, I mended it at once, but I’m keeping you \\nin overnight. You shouldn’t overexert yourself for a \\nfew hours.” \\n\\n“I don’t want to stay here overnight,” said Harry \\nangrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers. “I \\nwant to find McLaggen and kill him.” \\n\\n“I’m afraid that would come under the heading of \\n‘overexertion,’ ” said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him \\nfirmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a \\nthreatening manner. “You will stay here until I \\ndischarge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.” \\n\\nShe bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back \\ninto his pillows, fuming. \\n\\n“D’you know how much we lost by?” he asked Ron \\nthrough clenched teeth. \\n\\n“Well, yeah I do,” said Ron apologetically. “Final score \\nwas three hundred and twenty to sixty.” \\n\\n“Brilliant,” said Harry savagely. “Really brilliant! \\n\\nWhen I get hold of McLaggen — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 468 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a \\ntroll,” said Ron reasonably. “Personally, I think there’s \\na lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing \\nof the Prince’s. Anyway, the rest of the team might’ve \\ndealt with him before you get out of here, they’re not \\nhappy. ...” \\n\\nThere was a note of badly suppressed glee in Ron’s \\nvoice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled \\nthat McLaggen had messed up so badly. Harry lay \\nthere, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, \\nhis recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but \\nfeeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging. \\n\\n“I could hear the match commentary from here,” said \\nRon, his voice now shaking with laughter. “I hope \\nLuna always commentates from now on. ... Loser’s \\nLurgy ...” \\n\\nBut Harry was still too angry to see much humor in \\nthe situation, and after a while Ron’s snorts subsided. \\n\\n“Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” \\nhe said, after a long pause, and Harry’s imagination \\nzoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in \\nwhich Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed \\nher feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave \\nthem his blessing. ... “She reckons you only just \\narrived on time for the match. How come? You left \\nhere early enough.” \\n\\n“Oh ...” said Harry, as the scene in his mind’s eye \\nimploded. “Yeah ... well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off \\nwith a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted \\nto be with him, and that’s the second time he’s made \\nsure he isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the \\nrest of the school; he skipped the last match too, \\nremember?” Harry sighed. “Wish I’d followed him \\nnow, the match was such a fiasco. ...” \\n\\nPage | 469 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron sharply. “You couldn’t \\nhave missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, \\nyou’re the Captain!” \\n\\n“I want to know what he’s up to,” said Harry. “And \\ndon’t tell me it’s all in my head, not after what I \\noverheard between him and Snape — ” \\n\\n“I never said it was all in your head,” said Ron, \\nhoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning \\nat Harry, “but there’s no rule saying only one person \\nat a time can be plotting anything in this place! You’re \\ngetting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, \\nthinking about missing a match just to follow him ...” \\n\\n“I want to catch him at it!” said Harry in frustration. \\n\\n“I mean, where’s he going when he disappears off the \\nmap?” \\n\\n“I dunno . . . Hogsmeade?” suggested Ron, yawning. \\n\\n“I’ve never seen him going along any of the secret \\npassageways on the map. I thought they were being \\nwatched now anyway?” \\n\\n“Well then, I dunno,” said Ron. \\n\\nSilence fell between them. Harry stared up at the \\ncircle of lamplight above him, thinking. . . . \\n\\nIf only he had Rufus Scrimgeour’s power, he would \\nhave been able to set a tail upon Malfoy, but \\nunfortunately Harry did not have an office full of \\nAurors at his command. ... He thought fleetingly of \\ntrying to set something up with the D.A., but there \\nagain was the problem that people would be missed \\nfrom lessons; most of them, after all, still had full \\nschedules. ... \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 470 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a low, rumbling snore from Ron’s bed. \\n\\nAfter a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, \\nthis time wearing a thick dressing gown. It was \\neasiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto his side \\nand listened to all the curtains closing themselves as \\nshe waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, and she \\nreturned to her office; he heard the door click behind \\nher and knew that she was off to bed. \\n\\nThis was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third \\ntime that he had been brought to the hospital wing \\nbecause of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had fallen \\noff his broom due to the presence of dementors \\naround the pitch, and the time before that, all the \\nbones had been removed from his arm by the \\nincurably inept Professor Lockhart. ... That had been \\nhis most painful injury by far ... he remembered the \\nagony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a \\ndiscomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected \\nvisitor in the middle of the — \\n\\nHarry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his \\nbandage turban askew. He had the solution at last: \\nThere was a way to have Malfoy followed — how could \\nhe have forgotten, why hadn’t he thought of it before? \\n\\nBut the question was, how to call him? What did you \\ndo? \\n\\nQuietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness. \\n“Kreacher?” \\n\\nThere was a very loud crack, and the sounds of \\nscuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron \\nawoke with a yelp. \\n\\n“What’s going — ?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 471 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam \\nPomfrey’s office and muttered, “MuffliatoV’ so that she \\nwould not come running. Then he scrambled to the \\nend of his bed for a better look at what was going on. \\n\\nTwo house-elves were rolling around on the floor in \\nthe middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken \\nmaroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a \\nfilthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. \\nThen there was another loud bang, and Peeves the \\nPoltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling \\nelves. \\n\\n“I was watching that, Potty!” he told Harry \\nindignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting \\nout a loud cackle. “Look at the ickle creatures \\nsquabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy — ” \\n\\n“Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of \\nDobby, no he won’t, or Dobby will shut Kreacher’s \\nmouth for him!” cried Dobby in a high-pitched voice. \\n\\n“ — kicky, scratchy!” cried Peeves happily, now pelting \\nbits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further. \\n“Tweaky, pokey!” \\n\\n“Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh \\nyes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of \\nMudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher’s mistress \\nsay — ?” \\n\\nExactly what Kreacher’s mistress would have said \\nthey did not find out, for at that moment Dobby sank \\nhis knobbly little fist into Kreacher’s mouth and \\nknocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both \\nleapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves \\napart, though they continued to try and kick and \\npunch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 472 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naround the lamp squealing, “Stick your fingers up his \\nnosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies — ” \\n\\nHarry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Langlockl” \\nPeeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped \\nfrom the room making obscene gestures but unable to \\nspeak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just \\nglued itself to the roof of his mouth. \\n\\n“Nice one,” said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into \\nthe air so that his flailing limbs no longer made \\ncontact with Kreacher. “That was another Prince hex, \\nwasn’t it?” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, twisting Kreacher’s wizened arm \\ninto a half nelson. “Right — I’m forbidding you to fight \\neach other! Well, Kreacher, you’re forbidden to fight \\nDobby. Dobby, I know I’m not allowed to give you \\norders — ” \\n\\n“Dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he \\nlikes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants \\nhim to do!” said Dobby, tears now streaming down his \\nshriveled little face onto his jumper. \\n\\n“Okay then,” said Harry, and he and Ron both \\nreleased the elves, who fell to the floor but did not \\ncontinue fighting. \\n\\n“Master called me?” croaked Kreacher, sinking into a \\nbow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished \\nhim a painful death. \\n\\n“Yeah, I did,” said Harry, glancing toward Madam \\nPomfrey’s office door to check that the Muffliato spell \\nwas still working; there was no sign that she had \\nheard any of the commotion. “I’ve got a job for you.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 473 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Kreacher will do whatever Master wants,” said \\nKreacher, sinking so low that his lips almost touched \\nhis gnarled toes, “because Kreacher has no choice, \\nbut Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes \\n\\n\\n\\n“Dobby will do it, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, his \\ntennis-ball-sized eyes still swimming in tears. “Dobby \\nwould be honored to help Harry Potter!” \\n\\n“Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of \\nyou,” said Harry. “Okay then ... I want you to tail \\nDraco Malfoy.” \\n\\nIgnoring the look of mingled surprise and \\nexasperation on Ron’s face, Harry went on, “I want to \\nknow where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and what \\nhe’s doing. I want you to follow him around the \\nclock.” \\n\\n“Yes, Harry Potter!” said Dobby at once, his great eyes \\nshining with excitement. “And if Dobby does it wrong, \\nDobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, Harry \\nPotter!” \\n\\n“There won’t be any need for that,” said Harry hastily. \\n\\n“Master wants me to follow the youngest of the \\nMalfoys?” croaked Kreacher. “Master wants me to spy \\nupon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old \\nmistress?” \\n\\n“That’s the one,” said Harry, foreseeing a great danger \\nand determining to prevent it immediately. “And \\nyou’re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show \\nhim what you’re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to \\nwrite him messages or ... or to contact him in any \\nway. Got it?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 474 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a \\nloophole in the instructions he had just been given \\nand waited. After a moment or two, and to Harry’s \\ngreat satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and \\nsaid, with bitter resentment, “Master thinks of \\neverything, and Kreacher must obey him even though \\nKreacher would much rather be the servant of the \\nMalfoy boy, oh yes. ...” \\n\\n“That’s settled, then,” said Harry. “I’ll want regular \\nreports, but make sure I’m not surrounded by people \\nwhen you turn up. Ron and Hermione are okay. And \\ndon’t tell anyone what you’re doing. Just stick to \\nMalfoy like a couple of wart plasters.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 475 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLORD VOLDEMORT’S REQUEST \\n\\nHarry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on \\nMonday morning, restored to full health by the \\nministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to \\nenjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and \\npoisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was \\nfriends with Ron again. Hermione even escorted them \\ndown to breakfast, bringing with her the news that \\nGinny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature \\nin Harry’s chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the \\nair hopefully. \\n\\n“What did they row about?” he asked, trying to sound \\ncasual as they turned onto a seventh-floor corridor \\nthat was deserted but for a very small girl who had \\nbeen examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She \\nlooked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth \\nyears and dropped the heavy brass scales she was \\ncarrying. \\n\\n“It’s all right!” said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward \\nto help her. “Here ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 476 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nShe tapped the broken scales with her wand and \\nsaid, “Reparo.” The girl did not say thank you, but \\nremained rooted to the spot as they passed and \\nwatched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her. \\n\\n“I swear they’re getting smaller,” he said. \\n\\n“Never mind her,” said Harry, a little impatiently. \\n“What did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?” \\n\\n“Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that \\nBludger at you,” said Hermione. \\n\\n“It must’ve looked funny,” said Ron reasonably. \\n\\n“It didn’t look funny at all!” said Hermione hotly. “It \\nlooked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn’t caught \\nHarry he could have been very badly hurt!” \\n\\n“Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to \\nsplit up over it,” said Harry, still trying to sound \\ncasual. “Or are they still together?” \\n\\n“Yes, they are — but why are you so interested?” \\nasked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look. \\n\\n“I just don’t want my Quidditch team messed up \\nagain!” he said hastily, but Hermione continued to \\nlook suspicious, and he was most relieved when a \\nvoice behind them called, “Harry!” giving him an \\nexcuse to turn his back on her. \\n\\n“Oh, hi, Luna.” \\n\\n“I went to the hospital wing to find you,” said Luna, \\nrummaging in her bag. “But they said you’d left. ...” \\n\\nShe thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large \\nspotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what \\n\\nPage | 477 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlooked like cat litter into Ron’s hands, finally pulling \\nout a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she \\nhanded to Harry. \\n\\n\"... I’ve been told to give you this.” \\n\\nIt was a small roll of parchment, which Harry \\nrecognized at once as another invitation to a lesson \\nwith Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Tonight,” he told Ron and Hermione, once he had \\nunrolled it. \\n\\n“Nice commentary last match!” said Ron to Luna as \\nshe took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the \\ncat litter. Luna smiled vaguely. \\n\\n“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” she said. \\n“Everyone says I was dreadful.” \\n\\n“No, I’m serious!” said Ron earnestly. “I can’t \\nremember enjoying commentary more! What is this, \\nby the way?” he added, holding the onionlike object \\nup to eye level. \\n\\n“Oh, it’s a Gurdyroot,” she said, stuffing the cat litter \\nand the toadstool back into her bag. “You can keep it \\nif you like, I’ve got a few of them. They’re really \\nexcellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.” \\n\\nAnd she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still \\nclutching the Gurdyroot. \\n\\n“You know, she’s grown on me, Luna,” he said, as \\nthey set off again for the Great Hall. “I know she’s \\ninsane, but it’s in a good — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 478 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown \\nwas standing at the foot of the marble staircase \\nlooking thunderous. \\n\\n“Hi,” said Ron nervously. \\n\\n“C’mon,” Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped \\npast, though not before they had heard Lavender say, \\n“Why didn’t you tell me you were getting out today? \\nAnd why was she with you?” \\n\\nRon looked both sulky and annoyed when he \\nappeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though \\nhe sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them \\nexchange a word all the time they were together. \\nHermione was acting as though she was quite \\noblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an \\ninexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she \\nseemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that \\nevening in the common room she even consented to \\nlook over (in other words, finish writing) Harry’s \\nHerbology essay, something she had been resolutely \\nrefusing to do up to this point, because she had \\nknown that Harry would then let Ron copy his work. \\n\\n“Thanks a lot, Hermione,” said Harry, giving her a \\nhasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and \\nsaw that it was nearly eight o’clock. “Listen, I’ve got to \\nhurry or I’ll be late for Dumbledore. ...” \\n\\nShe did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of \\nhis feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, \\nHarry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to \\nthe headmaster’s office. The gargoyle leapt aside at \\nthe mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral \\nstaircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door \\njust as a clock within chimed eight. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 479 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Enter,” called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a \\nhand to push the door, it was wrenched open from \\ninside. There stood Professor Trelawney. \\n\\n“Aha!” she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as \\nshe blinked at him through her magnifying \\nspectacles. “So this is the reason I am to be thrown \\nunceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!” \\n\\n“My dear Sybill,” said Dumbledore in a slightly \\nexasperated voice, “there is no question of throwing \\nyou unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does \\nhave an appointment, and I really don’t think there is \\nany more to be said — ” \\n\\n“Very well,” said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply \\nwounded voice. “If you will not banish the usurping \\nnag, so be it. ... Perhaps I shall find a school where \\nmy talents are better appreciated. ...” \\n\\nShe pushed past Harry and disappeared down the \\nspiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway \\ndown, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over \\none of her trailing shawls. \\n\\n“Please close the door and sit down, Harry,” said \\nDumbledore, sounding rather tired. \\n\\nHarry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in \\nfront of Dumbledore ’s desk that the Pensieve lay \\nbetween them once more, as did two more tiny crystal \\nbottles full of swirling memory. \\n\\n“Professor Trelawney still isn’t happy Firenze is \\nteaching, then?” Harry asked. \\n\\n“No,” said Dumbledore, “Divination is turning out to \\nbe much more trouble than I could have foreseen, \\nnever having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask \\n\\nPage | 480 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirenze to return to the forest, where he is now an \\noutcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. \\nBetween ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she \\nwould be in outside the castle. She does not know — \\nand I think it would be unwise to enlighten her — \\nthat she made the prophecy about you and \\nVoldemort, you see.” \\n\\nDumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, “But \\nnever mind my staffing problems. We have much \\nmore important matters to discuss. Firstly — have \\nyou managed the task I set you at the end of our \\nprevious lesson?” \\n\\n“Ah,” said Harry, brought up short. What with \\nApparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being \\npoisoned and getting his skull cracked and his \\ndetermination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up \\nto, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory \\nDumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor \\nSlughorn. “Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it \\nat the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn’t give it \\nto me.” \\n\\nThere was a little silence. \\n\\n“I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry \\nover the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving \\nHarry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. \\n“And you feel that you have exerted your very best \\nefforts in this matter, do you? That you have \\nexercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you \\nhave left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your \\nquest to retrieve the memory?” \\n\\n“Well,” Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. \\n\\nHis single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly \\nseemed embarrassingly feeble. “Well ... the day Ron \\nswallowed love potion by mistake I took him to \\n\\nPage | 481 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor \\nSlughorn in a good enough mood — ” \\n\\n“And did that work?” asked Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned — ” \\n\\n“ — which, naturally, made you forget all about trying \\nto retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing \\nelse, while your best friend was in danger. Once it \\nbecame clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a \\nfull recovery, however, I would have hoped that you \\nreturned to the task I set you. I thought I made it \\nclear to you how very important that memory is. \\nIndeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is \\nthe most crucial memory of all and that we will be \\nwasting our time without it.” \\n\\nA hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of \\nHarry’s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore \\nhad not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, \\nbut Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold \\ndisappointment was worse than anything. \\n\\n“Sir,” he said, a little desperately, “it isn’t that I wasn’t \\nbothered or anything, I’ve just had other — other \\nthings ...” \\n\\n“Other things on your mind,” Dumbledore finished \\nthe sentence for him. “I see.” \\n\\nSilence fell between them again, the most \\nuncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced \\nwith Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, \\npunctuated only by the little grunting snores of the \\nportrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore ’s head. \\nHarry felt strangely diminished, as though he had \\nshrunk a little since he had entered the room. When \\nhe could stand it no longer he said, “Professor \\nPage | 482 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore, I’m really sorry. I should have done \\nmore. ... I should have realized you wouldn’t have \\nasked me to do it if it wasn’t really important.” \\n\\n“Thank you for saying that, Harry,” said Dumbledore \\nquietly. “May I hope, then, that you will give this \\nmatter higher priority from now on? There will be \\nlittle point in our meeting after tonight unless we \\nhave that memory.” \\n\\n“I’ll do it, sir, I’ll get it from him,” he said earnestly. \\n\\n“Then we shall say no more about it just now,” said \\nDumbledore more kindly, “but continue with our \\nstory where we left off. You remember where that \\nwas?” \\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Harry quickly. “Voldemort killed his \\nfather and his grandparents and made it look as \\nthough his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to \\nHogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor \\nSlughorn about Horcruxes,” he mumbled \\nshamefacedly. \\n\\n“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Now, you will \\nremember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of \\nthese meetings of ours that we would be entering the \\nrealms of guesswork and speculation?” \\n\\n“Yes, sir.” \\n\\n“Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you \\nreasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as \\nto what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen?” \\n\\nHarry nodded. \\n\\n“But now, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “now things \\nbecome murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find \\n\\nPage | 483 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nevidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost \\nimpossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce \\nabout the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether \\nthere is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could \\ngive us a full account of his life since he left \\nHogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I \\nwould like to share with you.” Dumbledore indicated \\nthe two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the \\nPensieve. “I shall then be glad of your opinion as to \\nwhether the conclusions I have drawn from them \\nseem likely.” \\n\\nThe idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this \\nhighly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed \\nthat he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux \\nmemory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as \\nDumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the \\nlight and examined it. \\n\\n“I hope you are not tired of diving into other people’s \\nmemories, for they are curious recollections, these \\ntwo,” he said. “This first one came from a very old \\nhouse-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what \\nHokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord \\nVoldemort left Hogwarts. \\n\\n“He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as \\nyou might have expected, top grades in every \\nexamination he had taken. All around him, his \\nclassmates were deciding which jobs they were to \\npursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody \\nexpected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, \\nHead Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to \\nthe School. I know that several teachers, Professor \\nSlughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the \\nMinistry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put \\nhim in touch with useful contacts. He refused all \\noffers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was \\nworking at Borgin and Burkes.” \\n\\nPage | 484 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“At Borgin and Burkes?” Harry repeated, stunned. \\n\\n\\n\\n“At Borgin and Burkes,” repeated Dumbledore calmly. \\n“I think you will see what attractions the place held \\nfor him when we have entered Hokey’s memory. But \\nthis was not Voldemort’s first choice of job. Hardly \\nanyone knew of it at the time — I was one of the few \\nin whom the then headmaster confided — but \\nVoldemort first approached Professor Dippet and \\nasked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a \\nteacher.” \\n\\n“He wanted to stay here? Why?” asked Harry, more \\namazed still. \\n\\n“I believe he had several reasons, though he confided \\nnone of them to Professor Dippet,” said Dumbledore. \\n“Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I \\nbelieve, more attached to this school than he has ever \\nbeen to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been \\nhappiest; the first and only place he had felt at \\nhome.” \\n\\nHarry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for \\nthis was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too. \\n\\n“Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. \\nUndoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of \\nits secrets than most of the students who pass \\nthrough the place, but he may have felt that there \\nwere still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap. \\n\\n“And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great \\npower and influence over young witches and wizards. \\nPerhaps he had gained the idea from Professor \\nSlughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best \\nterms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a \\nteacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that \\nVoldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at \\nPage | 485 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful \\nrecruiting ground, and a place where he might begin \\nto build himself an army.” \\n\\n“But he didn’t get the job, sir?” \\n\\n“No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was \\ntoo young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a \\nfew years, if he still wished to teach.” \\n\\n“How did you feel about that, sir?” asked Harry \\nhesitantly. \\n\\n“Deeply uneasy,” said Dumbledore. “I had advised \\nArmando against the appointment — I did not give \\nthe reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was \\nvery fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. \\nBut I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this \\nschool, and especially not in a position of power.” \\n\\n“Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he \\nwant to teach?” \\n\\nSomehow, Harry knew the answer even before \\nDumbledore gave it. \\n\\n“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at \\nthe time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea \\nMerrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly \\nfifty years. \\n\\n“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all \\nthe staff who had admired him said what a waste it \\nwas, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a \\nshop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. \\nPolite and handsome and clever, he was soon given \\nparticular jobs of the type that only exist in a place \\nlike Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you \\nknow, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful \\nPage |486 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nproperties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to \\npart with their treasures for sale by the partners, and \\nhe was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing \\nthis.” \\n\\n“I’ll bet he was,” said Harry, unable to contain \\nhimself. \\n\\n“Well, quite,” said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. \\n“And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, \\nwho worked for a very old, very rich witch by the \\nname of Hepzibah Smith.” \\n\\nDumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork \\nflew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the \\nPensieve, saying as he did so, “After you, Harry.” \\n\\nHarry got to his feet and bent once more over the \\nrippling silver contents of the stone basin until his \\nface touched them. He tumbled through dark \\nnothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of \\nan immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger \\nwig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all \\naround her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. \\nShe was looking into a small jeweled mirror and \\ndabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a \\nlarge powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house- \\nelf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight \\nsatin slippers. \\n\\n“Hurry up, Hokey!” said Hepzibah imperiously. “He \\nsaid he’d come at four, it’s only a couple of minutes to \\nand he’s never been late yet!” \\n\\nShe tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf \\nstraightened up. The top of the elf’s head barely \\nreached the seat of Hepzibah ’s chair, and her papery \\nskin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet \\nshe wore draped like a toga. \\n\\nPage | 487 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“How do I look?” said Hepzibah, turning her head to \\nadmire the various angles of her face in the mirror. \\n\\n“Lovely, madam,” squeaked Hokey. \\n\\nHarry could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s \\ncontract that she must lie through her teeth when \\nasked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked \\na long way from lovely in his opinion. \\n\\nA tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf \\njumped. \\n\\n“Quick, quick, he’s here, Hokey!” cried Hepzibah and \\nthe elf scurried out of the room, which was so \\ncrammed with objects that it was difficult to see how \\nanybody could navigate their way across it without \\nknocking over at least a dozen things: There were \\ncabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of \\ngold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial \\nglobes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass \\ncontainers. In fact, the room looked like a cross \\nbetween a magical antique shop and a conservatory. \\n\\nThe house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a \\ntall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in \\nrecognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a \\nblack suit; his hair was a little longer than it had \\nbeen at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all \\nof this suited him; he looked more handsome than \\never. He picked his way through the cramped room \\nwith an air that showed he had visited many times \\nbefore and bowed low over Hepzibah ’s fat little hand, \\nbrushing it with his lips. \\n\\n“I brought you flowers,” he said quietly, producing a \\nbunch of roses from nowhere. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 488 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You naughty boy, you shouldn’t have!” squealed old \\nHepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an \\nempty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. \\n“You do spoil this old lady, Tom. ... Sit down, sit \\ndown. ... Where’s Hokey? Ah ...” \\n\\nThe house-elf had come dashing back into the room \\ncarrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her \\nmistress’s elbow. \\n\\n“Help yourself, Tom,” said Hepzibah, “I know how you \\nlove my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They \\noverwork you at that shop, I’ve said it a hundred \\ntimes. ...” \\n\\nVoldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah \\nsimpered. \\n\\n“Well, what’s your excuse for visiting this time?” she \\nasked, batting her lashes. \\n\\n“Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for \\nthe goblin-made armor,” said Voldemort. “Five \\nhundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair — ” \\n\\n“Now, now, not so fast, or I’ll think you’re only here \\nfor my trinkets!” pouted Hepzibah. \\n\\n“I am ordered here because of them,” said Voldemort \\nquietly. “I am only a poor assistant, madam, who \\nmust do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire \\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!” said Hepzibah, waving a \\nlittle hand. “I’ve something to show you that I’ve never \\nshown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will \\nyou promise you won’t tell Mr. Burke I’ve got it? He’d \\nnever let me rest if he knew I’d shown it to you, and \\nI’m not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, \\nPage | 489 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTom, you’ll appreciate it for its history, not how many \\nGalleons you can get for it.” \\n\\n“I’d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,” \\nsaid Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another \\ngirlish giggle. \\n\\n“I had Hokey bring it out for me. ... Hokey, where are \\nyou? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. ... \\nIn fact, bring both, while you’re at it. ...” \\n\\n“Here, madam,” squeaked the house-elf, and Harry \\nsaw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, \\nmoving across the room as if of their own volition, \\nthough he knew the tiny elf was holding them over \\nher head as she wended her way between tables, \\npouffes, and footstools. \\n\\n“Now,” said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from \\nthe elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open \\nthe topmost one, “I think you’ll like this, Tom. ... Oh, \\nif my family knew I was showing you. ... They can’t \\nwait to get their hands on this!” \\n\\nShe opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get \\na better view and saw what looked like a small golden \\ncup with two finely wrought handles. \\n\\n“I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it \\nup, have a good look!” whispered Hepzibah, and \\nVoldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and \\nlifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken \\nwrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his \\ndark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously \\nmirrored on Hepzibah’s face, except that her tiny eyes \\nwere fixed upon Voldemort’s handsome features. \\n\\n“A badger,” murmured Voldemort, examining the \\nengraving upon the cup. “Then this was ... ?” \\n\\nPage | 490 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Helga Hufflepuff’s, as you very well know, you clever \\nboy!” said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud \\ncreaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow \\ncheek. “Didn’t I tell you I was distantly descended? \\nThis has been handed down in the family for years \\nand years. Lovely, isn’t it? And all sorts of powers it’s \\nsupposed to possess too, but I haven’t tested them \\nthoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. ...” \\n\\nShe hooked the cup back off Voldemort’s long \\nforefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent \\nupon settling it carefully back into position to notice \\nthe shadow that crossed Voldemort’s face as the cup \\nwas taken away. \\n\\n“Now then,” said Hepzibah happily, “where’s Hokey? \\nOh yes, there you are — take that away now, Hokey.” \\n\\nThe elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah \\nturned her attention to the much flatter box in her \\nlap. \\n\\n“I think you’ll like this even more, Tom,” she \\nwhispered. “Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. \\n...Of course, Burke knows I’ve got this one, I bought \\nit from him, and I daresay he’d love to get it back \\nwhen I’m gone. ...” \\n\\nShe slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open \\nthe box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a \\nheavy golden locket. \\n\\nVoldemort reached out his hand, without invitation \\nthis time, and held it up to the light, staring at it. \\n\\n“Slytherin’s mark,” he said quietly, as the light played \\nupon an ornate, serpentine S. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 491 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s right!” said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at \\nthe sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. \\n“I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn’t let \\nit pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for \\nmy collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a \\nragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, \\nbut had no idea of its true value — ” \\n\\nThere was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort’s eyes \\nflashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his \\nknuckles whiten on the locket’s chain. \\n\\n“ — I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you \\nare. ... Pretty, isn’t it? And again, all kinds of powers \\nattributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. ...” \\n\\nShe reached out to take the locket back. For a \\nmoment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going to \\nlet go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers \\nand was back in its red velvet cushion. \\n\\n“So there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed \\nthat!” \\n\\nShe looked him full in the face and for the first time, \\nHarry saw her foolish smile falter. \\n\\n“Are you all right, dear?” \\n\\n“Oh yes,” said Voldemort quietly. “Yes, I’m very well. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought — but a trick of the light, I suppose — ” \\nsaid Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed \\nthat she too had seen the momentary red gleam in \\nVoldemort’s eyes. “Here, Hokey, take these away and \\nlock them up again. ... The usual enchantments ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 492 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Time to leave, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly, and \\nas the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, \\nDumbledore grasped Harry once again above the \\nelbow and together they rose up through oblivion and \\nback to Dumbledore ’s office. \\n\\n“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,” \\nsaid Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating \\nthat Harry should do the same. “Hokey the house-elf \\nwas convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her \\nmistress’s evening cocoa by accident.” \\n\\n“No way!” said Harry angrily. \\n\\n“I see we are of one mind,” said Dumbledore. \\n“Certainly, there are many similarities between this \\ndeath and that of the Riddles. In both cases, \\nsomebody else took the blame, someone who had a \\nclear memory of having caused the death — ” \\n\\n“Hokey confessed?” \\n\\n“She remembered putting something in her mistress’s \\ncocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal \\nand little-known poison,” said Dumbledore. “It was \\nconcluded that she had not meant to do it, but being \\nold and confused — ” \\n\\n“Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with \\nMorfin!” \\n\\n“Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said Dumbledore. \\n“And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was \\npredisposed to suspect Hokey — ” \\n\\n“ — because she was a house-elf,” said Harry. He had \\nrarely felt more in sympathy with the society \\nHermione had set up, S.P.E.W. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 493 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Precisely,” said Dumbledore. “She was old, she \\nadmitted to having tampered with the drink, and \\nnobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As \\nin the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and \\nmanaged to extract this memory, her life was almost \\nover — but her memory, of course, proves nothing \\nexcept that Voldemort knew of the existence of the \\ncup and the locket. \\n\\n“By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah’s family \\nhad realized that two of her greatest treasures were \\nmissing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for \\nshe had many hiding places, having always guarded \\nher collection most jealously. But before they were \\nsure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were \\nboth gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin \\nand Burkes, the young man who had visited \\nHepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had \\nresigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no \\nidea where he had gone; they were as surprised as \\nanyone at his disappearance. And that was the last \\nthat was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long \\ntime. \\n\\n“Now,” said Dumbledore, “if you don’t mind, Harry, I \\nwant to pause once more to draw your attention to \\ncertain points of our story. Voldemort had committed \\nanother murder; whether it was his first since he \\nkilled the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. \\nThis time, as you will have seen, he killed not for \\nrevenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous \\ntrophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. \\nJust as he had once robbed the other children at his \\norphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin ’s \\nring, so he ran off now with Hepzibah’s cup and \\nlocket.” \\n\\n“But,” said Harry, frowning, “it seems mad. ... Risking \\neverything, throwing away his job, just for those ...” \\n\\nPage | 494 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,” said \\nDumbledore. “I hope you will understand in due \\ncourse exactly what those objects meant to him, \\nHarry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to \\nimagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully \\nhis.” \\n\\n“The locket maybe,” said Harry, “but why take the \\ncup as well?” \\n\\n“It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. “I think he still felt a great pull \\ntoward the school and that he could not resist an \\nobject so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were \\nother reasons, I think. ... I hope to be able to \\ndemonstrate them to you in due course. \\n\\n“And now for the very last recollection I have to show \\nyou, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor \\nSlughorn’s memory for us. Ten years separates \\nHokey’s memory and this one, ten years during which \\nwe can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore \\nemptied the last memory into the Pensieve. \\n\\n“Whose memory is it?” he asked. \\n\\n“Mine,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\nAnd Harry dived after Dumbledore through the \\nshifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had \\njust left. There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his \\nperch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, \\nwho looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing \\nbeside Harry, though both hands were whole and \\nundamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less \\nlined. The one difference between the present-day \\nPage | 495 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\noffice and this one was that it was snowing in the \\npast; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in \\nthe dark and building up on the outside ledge. \\n\\nThe younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for \\nsomething, and sure enough, moments after their \\narrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, \\n“Enter.” \\n\\nHarry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had \\nentered the room. His features were not those Harry \\nhad seen emerge from the great stone cauldron \\nalmost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the \\neyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, \\nand yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It \\nwas as though his features had been burned and \\nblurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the \\nwhites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody \\nlook, though the pupils were not yet the slits that \\nHarry knew they would become. He was wearing a \\nlong black cloak, and his face was as pale as the \\nsnow glistening on his shoulders. \\n\\nThe Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of \\nsurprise. Evidently this visit had been made by \\nappointment. \\n\\n“Good evening, Tom,” said Dumbledore easily. “Won’t \\nyou sit down?” \\n\\n“Thank you,” said Voldemort, and he took the seat to \\nwhich Dumbledore had gestured — the very seat, by \\nthe looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the \\npresent. “I heard that you had become headmaster,” \\nhe said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder \\nthan it had been. “A worthy choice.” \\n\\n“I am glad you approve,” said Dumbledore, smiling. \\n“May I offer you a drink?” \\n\\nPage | 496 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“That would be welcome,” said Voldemort. “I have \\ncome a long way.” \\n\\nDumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet \\nwhere he now kept the Pensieve, but which then was \\nfull of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a goblet of \\nwine and poured one for himself, he returned to the \\nseat behind his desk. \\n\\n“So, Tom ... to what do I owe the pleasure?” \\n\\nVoldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped \\nhis wine. \\n\\n“They do not call me Tom’ anymore,” he said. “These \\ndays, I am known as — ” \\n\\n“I know what you are known as,” said Dumbledore, \\nsmiling pleasantly. “But to me, I’m afraid, you will \\nalways be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things \\nabout old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite \\nforget their charges’ youthful beginnings.” \\n\\nHe raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, \\nwhose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, \\nHarry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: \\nDumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen \\nname was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the \\nterms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that \\nVoldemort took it as such. \\n\\n“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said \\nVoldemort after a short pause. “I always wondered \\nwhy a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave \\nschool.” \\n\\n“Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard \\nsuch as myself, there can be nothing more important \\nthan passing on ancient skills, helping hone young \\n\\nPage | 497 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nminds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the \\nattraction of teaching too.” \\n\\n“I see it still,” said Voldemort. “I merely wondered why \\nyou — who are so often asked for advice by the \\nMinistry, and who have twice, I think, been offered \\nthe post of Minister — ” \\n\\n“Three times at the last count, actually,” said \\nDumbledore. “But the Ministry never attracted me as \\na career. Again, something we have in common, I \\nthink.” \\n\\nVoldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took \\nanother sip of wine. Dumbledore did not break the \\nsilence that stretched between them now, but waited, \\nwith a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to \\ntalk first. \\n\\n“I have returned,” he said, after a little while, “later, \\nperhaps, than Professor Dippet expected ... but I have \\nreturned, nevertheless, to request again what he once \\ntold me I was too young to have. I have come to you to \\nask that you permit me to return to this castle, to \\nteach. I think you must know that I have seen and \\ndone much since I left this place. I could show and \\ntell your students things they can gain from no other \\nwizard.” \\n\\nDumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his \\nown goblet for a while before speaking. \\n\\n“Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done \\nmuch since leaving us,” he said quietly. “Rumors of \\nyour doings have reached your old school, Tom. I \\nshould be sorry to believe half of them.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 498 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVoldemort ’s expression remained impassive as he \\nsaid, “Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, \\nspite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do \\nyou?” asked Dumbledore delicately. \\n\\n“Certainly,” said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to \\nburn red. “I have experimented; I have pushed the \\nboundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have \\never been pushed — ” \\n\\n“Of some kinds of magic,” Dumbledore corrected him \\nquietly. “Of some. Of others, you remain ... forgive me \\n... woefully ignorant.” \\n\\nFor the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut \\nleer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of \\nrage. \\n\\n“The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I \\nhave seen in the world has supported your famous \\npronouncements that love is more powerful than my \\nkind of magic, Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,” \\nsuggested Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Well, then, what better place to start my fresh \\nresearches than here, at Hogwarts?” said Voldemort. \\n“Will you let me return? Will you let me share my \\nknowledge with your students? I place myself and my \\ntalents at your disposal. I am yours to command.” \\n\\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. “And what will \\nbecome of those whom you command? What will \\nhappen to those who call themselves — or so rumor \\nhas it — the Death Eaters?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 499 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry could tell that Voldemort had not expected \\nDumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemort’s \\neyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare. \\n\\n“My friends,” he said, after a moment’s pause, “will \\ncarry on without me, I am sure.” \\n\\n“I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. “I was under the impression that \\nthey are more in the order of servants.” \\n\\n“You are mistaken,” said Voldemort. \\n\\n“Then if I were to go to the Hog’s Head tonight, I \\nwould not find a group of them — Nott, Rosier, \\nMulciber, Dolohov — awaiting your return? Devoted \\nfriends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy \\nnight, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to \\nsecure a teaching post.” \\n\\nThere could be no doubt that Dumbledore ’s detailed \\nknowledge of those with whom he was traveling was \\neven less welcome to Voldemort; however, he rallied \\nalmost at once. \\n\\n“You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,” said \\nDumbledore lightly. “Now, Tom ...” \\n\\nDumbledore set down his empty glass and drew \\nhimself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together \\nin a very characteristic gesture. \\n\\n“Let us speak openly. Why have you come here \\ntonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job \\nwe both know you do not want?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 500 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVoldemort looked coldly surprised. “A job I do not \\nwant? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very \\nmuch.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do \\nnot want to teach any more than you wanted to when \\nyou were eighteen. What is it you’re after, Tom? Why \\nnot try an open request for once?” \\n\\nVoldemort sneered. “If you do not want to give me a \\njob -” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course I don’t,” said Dumbledore. “And I don’t \\nthink for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, \\nyou came here, you asked, you must have had a \\npurpose.” \\n\\nVoldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle \\nthan ever, his features thick with rage. “This is your \\nfinal word?” \\n\\n“It is,” said Dumbledore, also standing. \\n\\n“Then we have nothing more to say to each other.” \\n\\n“No, nothing,” said Dumbledore, and a great sadness \\nfilled his face. “The time is long gone when I could \\nfrighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you \\nto make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I \\ncould, Tom. ... I wish I could. ...” \\n\\nFor a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a \\npointless warning: He was sure that Voldemort’s hand \\nhad twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but \\nthen the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned \\naway, the door was closing, and he was gone. \\n\\nHarry felt Dumbledore ’s hand close over his arm \\nagain and moments later, they were standing together \\n\\nPage | 501 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\non almost the same spot, but there was no snow \\nbuilding on the window ledge, and Dumbledore’s \\nhand was blackened and dead-looking once more. \\n\\n“Why?” said Harry at once, looking up into \\nDumbledore’s face. “Why did he come back? Did you \\never find out?” \\n\\n“I have ideas,” said Dumbledore, “but no more than \\nthat.” \\n\\n“What ideas, sir?” \\n\\n“I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that \\nmemory from Professor Slughorn,” said Dumbledore. \\n“When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, \\neverything will, I hope, be clear ... to both of us.” \\n\\nHarry was still burning with curiosity and even \\nthough Dumbledore had walked to the door and was \\nholding it open for him, he did not move at once. \\n\\n“Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job \\nagain, sir? He didn’t say. ...” \\n\\n“Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the \\nDark Arts job,” said Dumbledore. “The aftermath of \\nour little meeting proved that. You see, we have never \\nbeen able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts \\nteacher for longer than a year since I refused the post \\nto Lord Voldemort.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 502 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE UNKNOWABLE ROOM \\n\\nHarry wracked his brains over the next week as to \\nhow he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the \\ntrue memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain \\nwave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he \\ndid increasingly these days when at a loss: poring \\nover his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would \\nhave scribbled something useful in a margin, as he \\nhad done so many times before. \\n\\n“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione \\nfirmly, late on Sunday evening. \\n\\n“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry. “If it hadn’t been \\nfor the Prince, Ron wouldn’t be sitting here now.” \\n\\n“He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our first \\nyear,” said Hermione dismissively. \\n\\nHarry ignored her. He had just found an incantation \\n(“ Sectumsempral”) scrawled in a margin above the \\nintriguing words “For Enemies,” and was itching to \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 503 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\ntry it out, but thought it best not to in front of \\nHermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the \\ncorner of the page. \\n\\nThey were sitting beside the fire in the common room; \\nthe only other people awake were fellow sixth years. \\nThere had been a certain amount of excitement earlier \\nwhen they had come back from dinner to find a new \\nsign on the notice board that announced the date for \\ntheir Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen \\non or before the first test date, the twenty-first of \\nApril, had the option of signing up for additional \\npractice sessions, which would take place (heavily \\nsupervised) in Hogsmeade. \\n\\nRon had panicked on reading this notice; he had still \\nnot managed to Apparate and feared he would not be \\nready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved \\nApparition twice, was a little more confident, but \\nHarry, who would not be seventeen for another four \\nmonths, could not take the test whether ready or not. \\n\\n“At least you can Apparate, though!” said Ron tensely. \\n“You’ll have no trouble come July!” \\n\\n“I’ve only done it once,” Harry reminded him; he had \\nfinally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside \\nhis hoop during their previous lesson. \\n\\nHaving wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about \\nApparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a \\nviciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and \\nHermione had already completed. Harry fully \\nexpected to receive low marks on his, because he had \\ndisagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle \\ndementors, but he did not care: Slughorn’s memory \\nwas the most important thing to him now. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 504 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Tm telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be \\nable to help you with this, Harry!” said Hermione, \\nmore loudly. “There’s only one way to force someone \\nto do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, \\nwhich is illegal — ” \\n\\n“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking \\nup from the book. “That’s why I’m looking for \\nsomething different. Dumbledore says Veritaserum \\nwon’t do it, but there might be something else, a \\npotion or a spell. ...” \\n\\n“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. \\n“Only you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. \\n\\nThat must mean you can persuade Slughorn where \\nother people can’t. It’s not a question of slipping him \\na potion, anyone could do that — ” \\n\\n“How d’you spell ‘belligerent’?” said Ron, shaking his \\nquill very hard while staring at his parchment. “It \\ncan’t be B — U — M — ” \\n\\n“No, it isn’t,” said Hermione, pulling Ron’s essay \\ntoward her. “And ‘augury’ doesn’t begin O — R — G \\neither. What kind of quill are you using?” \\n\\n“It’s one of Fred and George’s Spell-Check ones ... but \\nI think the charm must be wearing off. ...” \\n\\n“Yes, it must,” said Hermione, pointing at the title of \\nhis essay, “because we were asked how we’d deal with \\ndementors, not ‘Dugbogs,’ and I don’t remember you \\nchanging your name to ‘Roonil Wazlib’ either.” \\n\\n“Ah no!” said Ron, staring horror-struck at the \\nparchment. “Don’t say I’ll have to write the whole \\nthing out again!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 505 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s okay, we can fix it,” said Hermione, pulling the \\nessay toward her and taking out her wand. \\n\\n“I love you, Hermione,” said Ron, sinking back in his \\nchair, rubbing his eyes wearily. \\n\\nHermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t \\nlet Lavender hear you saying that.” \\n\\n“I won’t,” said Ron into his hands. “Or maybe I will ... \\nthen she’ll ditch me ...” \\n\\n“Why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it?” \\nasked Harry. \\n\\n“You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you?” said \\nRon. “You and Cho just — ” \\n\\n“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Harry \\n\\n“Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” \\nsaid Ron gloomily, watching Hermione silently \\ntapping each of his misspelled words with the end of \\nher wand, so that they corrected themselves on the \\npage. “But the more I hint I want to finish it, the \\ntighter she holds on. It’s like going out with the giant \\nsquid.” \\n\\n“There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, \\nhanding back Ron’s essay. \\n\\n“Thanks a million,” said Ron. “Can I borrow your quill \\nfor the conclusion?” \\n\\nHarry, who had found nothing useful in the Half- \\nBlood Prince’s notes so far, looked around; the three \\nof them were now the only ones left in the common \\nroom, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing \\nSnape and his essay. The only sounds were the \\nPage | 506 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncrackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last \\nparagraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. \\n\\nHarry had just closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, \\nyawning, when — \\n\\nCrack. \\n\\nHermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all \\nover his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, \\n“Kreacher!” \\n\\nThe house-elf bowed low and addressed his own \\ngnarled toes. \\n\\n“Master said he wanted regular reports on what the \\nMalfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to give — ” \\n\\nCrack. \\n\\nDobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat \\naskew. \\n\\n“Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!” he \\nsqueaked, casting Kreacher a resentful look. “And \\nKreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to \\nsee Harry Potter so they can make their reports \\ntogether!” \\n\\n“What is this?” asked Hermione, still looking shocked \\nby these sudden appearances. “What’s going on, \\nHarry?” \\n\\nHarry hesitated before answering, because he had not \\ntold Hermione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to \\ntail Malfoy; house-elves were always such a touchy \\nsubject with her. \\n\\n“Well ... they’ve been following Malfoy for me,” he \\nsaid. \\n\\nPage | 507 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Night and day,” croaked Kreacher. \\n\\n“Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!” said \\nDobby proudly, swaying where he stood. \\n\\nHermione looked indignant. \\n\\n“You haven’t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you \\ndidn’t tell him not to — ” \\n\\n“No, of course I didn’t,” said Harry quickly. “Dobby, \\nyou can sleep, all right? But has either of you found \\nout anything?” he hastened to ask, before Hermione \\ncould intervene again. \\n\\n“Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his \\npure blood,” croaked Kreacher at once. “His features \\nrecall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners \\nare those of — ” \\n\\n“Draco Malfoy is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily. \\n“A bad boy who — who — ” \\n\\nHe shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the \\ntoes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though \\nabout to dive into it; Harry, to whom this was not \\nentirely unexpected, caught him around the middle \\nand held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby \\nstruggled, then went limp. \\n\\n“Thank you, Harry Potter,” he panted. “Dobby still \\nfinds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters. ...” \\n\\nHarry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy \\nand said defiantly to Kreacher, “But Kreacher should \\nknow that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a \\nhouse-elf!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 508 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love \\nwith Malfoy,” Harry told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward \\nto where he’s actually been going.” \\n\\nKreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, \\n“Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a \\ndormitory in the dungeons, he attends his classes in \\na variety of — ” \\n\\n“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across \\nKreacher. “Has he been going anywhere he shouldn’t \\nhave?” \\n\\n“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike \\neyes shining in the firelight, “the Malfoy boy is \\nbreaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is \\nstill keen to avoid detection. He has been making \\nregular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of \\nother students, who keep watch for him while he \\nenters — ” \\n\\n“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking \\nhimself hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion- \\nMaking. Hermione and Ron stared at him. “That’s \\nwhere he’s been sneaking off to! That’s where he’s \\ndoing ... whatever he’s doing! And I bet that’s why \\nhe’s been disappearing off the map — come to think \\nof it, I’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on \\nthere!” \\n\\n“Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was \\nthere,” said Ron. \\n\\n“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said \\nHermione. “If you need it to be Unplottable, it will be.” \\n\\n“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at \\nwhat Malfoy’s doing?” said Harry eagerly. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 509 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby. \\n\\n\\n\\n“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our \\nheadquarters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in \\nand spy on him, no problem.” \\n\\n“But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione \\nslowly. “Malfoy already knew exactly how we were \\nusing the room, didn’t he, because that stupid \\nMarietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become \\nthe headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t \\nknow what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in \\nthere, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform \\ninto.” \\n\\n“There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry \\ndismissively. “You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby.” \\n\\n“Kreacher’s done well too,” said Hermione kindly; but \\nfar from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, \\nbloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, “The \\nMudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will \\npretend he cannot hear — ” \\n\\n“Get out of it,” Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher \\nmade one last deep bow and Disapparated. “You’d \\nbetter go and get some sleep too, Dobby.” \\n\\n“Thank you, Harry Potter, sir!” squeaked Dobby \\nhappily, and he too vanished. \\n\\n“How good’s this?” said Harry enthusiastically, \\nturning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room \\nwas elf-free again. “We know where Malfoy’s going! \\nWe’ve got him cornered now!” \\n\\n“Yeah, it’s great,” said Ron glumly, who was \\nattempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink that \\nhad recently been an almost completed essay. \\n\\nPage | 510 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning \\nthe ink off with her wand. \\n\\n“But what’s all this about him going up there with a \\nVariety of students’?” said Hermione. “How many \\npeople are in on it? You wouldn’t think he’d trust lots \\nof them to know what he’s doing. ...” \\n\\n“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard \\nhim telling Crabbe it wasn’t Crabbe’s business what \\nhe was doing ... so what’s he telling all these ... all \\nthese ...” \\n\\nHarry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire. \\n\\n“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, \\nisn’t it? There was a great vat of it down in the \\ndungeon. ... He could’ve nicked some any time during \\nthat lesson. ...” \\n\\n“Nicked what?” said Ron. \\n\\n“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice \\nPotion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions \\nlesson. ... There aren’t a whole variety of students \\nstanding guard for Malfoy ... it’s just Crabbe and \\nGoyle as usual. ... Yeah, it all fits!” said Harry, \\njumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. \\n“They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if \\nhe won’t tell them what he’s up to ... but he doesn’t \\nwant them to be seen lurking around outside the \\nRoom of Requirement, so he’s got them taking \\nPolyjuice to make them look like other people. ... \\nThose two girls I saw him with when he missed \\nQuidditch — ha! Crabbe and Goyle!” \\n\\n“Do you mean to say,” said Hermione in a hushed \\nvoice, “that that little girl whose scales I repaired — ?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 511 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah, of course!” said Harry loudly, staring at her. \\n“Of course! Malfoy must’ve been inside the room at \\nthe time, so she — what am I talking about? — he \\ndropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out, \\nbecause there was someone there! And there was that \\ngirl who dropped the toadspawn too! We’ve been \\nwalking past him all the time and not realizing it!” \\n\\n“He’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?” \\nguffawed Ron. “Blimey ... No wonder they don’t look \\ntoo happy these days. ... I’m surprised they don’t tell \\nhim to stuff it. ...” \\n\\n“Well, they wouldn’t, would they, if he’s shown them \\nhis Dark Mark?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said \\nHermione skeptically, rolling up Ron’s dried essay \\nbefore it could come to any more harm and handing it \\nto him. \\n\\n“Well see,” said Harry confidently. \\n\\n“Yes, we will,” Hermione said, getting to her feet and \\nstretching. “But, Harry, before you get all excited, I \\nstill don’t think you’ll be able to get into the Room of \\nRequirement without knowing what’s there first. And \\nI don’t think you should forget” — she heaved her bag \\nonto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look — \\n“that what you’re supposed to be concentrating on is \\ngetting that memory from Slughorn. Good night.” \\n\\nHarry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. \\nOnce the door to the girls’ dormitories had closed \\nbehind her he rounded on Ron. \\n\\n“What d’you think?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 512 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,” said Ron, \\nstaring at the spot where Dobby had vanished. “I’d \\nhave that Apparition Test in the bag.” \\n\\nHarry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for \\nwhat felt like hours, wondering how Malfoy was using \\nthe Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would \\nsee when he went in there the following day, for \\nwhatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if \\nMalfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the \\nD.A., he would be able to see Malfoy ’s ... what could it \\nbe? A meeting place? A hideout? A storeroom? A \\nworkshop? Harry’s mind worked feverishly and his \\ndreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and \\ndisturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into \\nSlughorn, who turned into Snape. ... \\n\\nHarry was in a state of great anticipation over \\nbreakfast the following morning; he had a free period \\nbefore Defense Against the Dark Arts and was \\ndetermined to spend it trying to get into the Room of \\nRequirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously \\nshowing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing \\nentry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he \\nthought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to. \\n\\n“Look,” he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a \\nhand on the Daily Prophet, which she had just \\nremoved from a post owl, to stop her from opening it \\nand vanishing behind it. “I haven’t forgotten about \\nSlughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that \\nmemory off him, and until I get a brain wave why \\nshouldn’t I find out what Malfoy’s doing?” \\n\\n“I’ve already told you, you need to persuade \\nSlughorn,” said Hermione. “It’s not a question of \\ntricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could \\nhave done it in a second. Instead of messing around \\noutside the Room of Requirement” — she jerked the \\nPage | 513 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProphet out from under Harry’s hand and unfolded it \\nto look at the front page — “you should go and find \\nSlughorn and start appealing to his better nature.” \\n\\n“Anyone we know — ?” asked Ron, as Hermione \\nscanned the headlines. \\n\\n“Yes!” said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to \\ngag on their breakfast. “But it’s all right, he’s not \\ndead — it’s Mundungus, he’s been arrested and sent \\nto Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an \\nInferius during an attempted burglary . . . and \\nsomeone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. ... Oh, \\nand how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been \\narrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think \\nhe was under the Imperius Curse. ...” \\n\\nThey finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set \\noff immediately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the \\ncommon room, where he still had to finish his \\nconclusion on Snape’s dementor essay; and Harry for \\nthe corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of \\nwall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy \\nteaching trolls to do ballet. \\n\\nHarry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had \\nfound an empty passage, but he need not have \\nbothered. When he reached his destination he found \\nit deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances \\nof getting inside the room were better with Malfoy \\ninside it or out, but at least his first attempt was not \\ngoing to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or \\nGoyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl. \\n\\nHe closed his eyes as he approached the place where \\nthe Room of Requirement’s door was concealed. He \\nknew what he had to do; he had become most \\naccomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all \\nhis might he thought, I need to see what Malfoy ’s \\nPage | 514 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndoing in here. ... I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in \\nhere. ... I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here. ... \\n\\nThree times he walked past the door; then, his heart \\npounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and \\nfaced it — \\n\\nBut he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely \\nblank wall. \\n\\nHe moved forward and gave it an experimental push. \\nThe stone remained solid and unyielding. \\n\\n“Okay,” said Harry aloud. “Okay ... I thought the \\nwrong thing. ...” \\n\\nHe pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes \\nclosed, concentrating as hard as he could. \\n\\nI need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming \\nsecretly. ... I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps \\ncoming secretly. . . . \\n\\nAfter three walks past, he opened his eyes \\nexpectantly. \\n\\nThere was no door. \\n\\n“Oh, come off it,” he told the wall irritably. “That was \\na clear instruction. ... Fine ...” \\n\\nHe thought hard for several minutes before striding \\noff once more. \\n\\nI need you to become the place you become for Draco \\nMalfoy. ... \\n\\nHe did not immediately open his eyes when he had \\nfinished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as \\n\\nPage | 515 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthough he might hear the door pop into existence. He \\nheard nothing, however, except the distant twittering \\nof birds outside. He opened his eyes. \\n\\nThere was still no door. \\n\\nHarry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to \\nsee a gaggle of first years running back around the \\ncorner, apparently under the impression that they \\nhad just encountered a particularly foulmouthed \\nghost. \\n\\nHarry tried every variation of “I need to see what \\nDraco Malfoy is doing inside you” that he could think \\nof for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced \\nto concede that Hermione might have had a point: \\n\\nThe room simply did not want to open for him. \\nFrustrated and annoyed, he set off for Defense \\nAgainst the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak \\nand stuffing it into his bag as he went. \\n\\n“Late again, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry \\nhurried into the candlelit classroom. “Ten points from \\nGryffindor.” \\n\\nHarry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the \\nseat beside Ron; half the class was still on its feet, \\ntaking out books and organizing their things; he \\ncould not be much later than any of them. \\n\\n“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said \\nSnape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twenty- \\nfive scrolls of parchment soared into the air and \\nlanded in a neat pile on his desk. “And I hope for your \\nsakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure \\non resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all \\nopen your books to page — what is it, Mr. Finnigan?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 516 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sir,” said Seamus, “I’ve been wondering, how do you \\ntell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? \\nBecause there was something in the paper about an \\nInferius — ” \\n\\n“No, there wasn’t,” said Snape in a bored voice. \\n\\n“But sir, I heard people talking — ” \\n\\n“If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. \\nFinnigan, you would have known that the so-called \\nInferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the \\nname of Mundungus Fletcher.” \\n\\n“I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same \\nside,” muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione. \\n“Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest \\n\\n\\n\\n“But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” \\nsaid Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the \\nroom, his black eyes fixed on Harry “Let us ask Potter \\nhow we would tell the difference between an Inferius \\nand a ghost.” \\n\\nThe whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily \\ntried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the \\nnight that they had gone to visit Slughorn. \\n\\n“Er — well — ghosts are transparent — ” he said. \\n\\n“Oh, very good,” interrupted Snape, his lip curling. \\n“Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical \\neducation have not been wasted on you, Potter. \\n‘Ghosts are transparent.’ ” \\n\\nPansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several \\nother people were smirking. Harry took a deep breath \\nand continued calmly, though his insides were \\n\\nPage | 517 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nboiling, “Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are \\ndead bodies, aren’t they? So they’d be solid — ” \\n\\n“A five-year-old could have told us as much,” sneered \\nSnape. “The Inferius is a corpse that has been \\nreanimated by a Dark wizard’s spells. It is not alive, it \\nis merely used like a puppet to do the wizard’s \\nbidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by \\nnow, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the \\nearth ... and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, \\ntransparent.” \\n\\n“Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re \\ntrying to tell them apart!” said Ron. “When we come \\nface-to-face with one down a dark alley, we’re going to \\nbe having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t we, we’re \\nnot going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the \\nimprint of a departed soul?’ ” \\n\\nThere was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by \\nthe look Snape gave the class. \\n\\n“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape. “I \\nwould expect nothing more sophisticated from you, \\nRonald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate \\nhalf an inch across a room.” \\n\\n“IVo!” whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as \\nhe opened his mouth furiously. “There’s no point, \\nyou’ll just end up in detention again, leave it!” \\n\\n“Now open your books to page two hundred and \\nthirteen,” said Snape, smirking a little, “and read the \\nfirst two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse. ...” \\n\\nRon was very subdued all through the class. When \\nthe bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender \\ncaught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione \\nmysteriously melted out of sight as she approached) \\n\\nPage | 518 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron’s \\nApparition, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, \\nand he shook her off by making a detour into the \\nboys’ bathroom with Harry. \\n\\n“Snape’s right, though, isn’t he?” said Ron, after \\nstaring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. “I \\ndunno whether it’s worth me taking the test. I just \\ncan’t get the hang of Apparition.” \\n\\n“You might as well do the extra practice sessions in \\nHogsmeade and see where they get you,” said Harry \\nreasonably. “It’ll be more interesting than trying to get \\ninto a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you’re still not — \\nyou know — as good as you’d like to be, you can \\npostpone the test, do it with me over the summ — \\nMyrtle, this is the boys’ bathroom!” \\n\\nThe ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a \\ncubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, \\nstaring at them through thick, white, round glasses. \\n\\n“Oh,” she said glumly. “It’s you two.” \\n\\n“Who were you expecting?” said Ron, looking at her in \\nthe mirror. \\n\\n“Nobody,” said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on \\nher chin. “He said he’d come back and see me, but \\nthen you said you’d pop in and visit me too” — she \\ngave Harry a reproachful look — “and I haven’t seen \\nyou for months and months. I’ve learned not to expect \\ntoo much from boys.” \\n\\n“I thought you lived in that girls’ bathroom?” said \\nHarry, who had been careful to give the place a wide \\nberth for some years now. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 519 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do,” she said, with a sulky little shrug, “but that \\ndoesn’t mean I can’t visit other places. I came and \\nsaw you in your bath once, remember?” \\n\\n“Vividly,” said Harry. \\n\\n“But I thought he liked me,” she said plaintively. \\n“Maybe if you two left, he’d come back again. ... We \\nhad lots in common. ... I’m sure he felt it. ...” \\n\\nAnd she looked hopefully toward the door. \\n\\n“When you say you had lots in common,” said Ron, \\nsounding rather amused now, “d’you mean he lives in \\nan S-bend too?” \\n\\n“No,” said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly \\naround the old tiled bathroom. “I mean he’s sensitive, \\npeople bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn’t \\ngot anybody to talk to, and he’s not afraid to show his \\nfeelings and cry!” \\n\\n“There’s been a boy in here crying?” said Harry \\ncuriously. “A young boy?” \\n\\n“Never you mind!” said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes \\nfixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. “I \\npromised I wouldn’t tell anyone, and I’ll take his \\nsecret to the — ” \\n\\n“ — not the grave, surely?” said Ron with a snort. “The \\nsewers, maybe ...” \\n\\nMyrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the \\ntoilet, causing water to slop over the sides and onto \\nthe floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh \\nheart into Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 520 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back \\nover his shoulder, “I’ll do the practice sessions in \\nHogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.” \\n\\nAnd so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione \\nand the rest of the sixth years who would turn \\nseventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry \\nfelt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go \\ninto the village; he missed making trips there, and it \\nwas a particularly fine spring day, one of the first \\nclear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he \\nhad decided to use the time to attempt another \\nassault on the Room of Requirement. \\n\\n“You’d do better,” said Hermione, when he confided \\nthis plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, “to go \\nstraight to Slughorn’s office and try and get that \\nmemory from him.” \\n\\n“I’ve been trying!” said Harry crossly, which was \\nperfectly true. He had lagged behind after every \\nPotions lesson that week in an attempt to corner \\nSlughorn, but the Potions master always left the \\ndungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch \\nhim. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, \\nbut received no reply, though on the second occasion \\nhe was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds \\nof an old gramophone. \\n\\n“He doesn’t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell \\nI’ve been trying to get him on his own again, and he’s \\nnot going to let it happen!” \\n\\n“Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?” \\n\\nThe short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, \\nwho was doing his usual prodding act with the \\nSecrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry \\ndid not answer in case he was overheard by the \\n\\nPage | 521 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncaretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, \\nthen turned and climbed the marble staircase again, \\ndetermined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an \\nhour or two to the Room of Requirement. \\n\\nOnce out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled \\nthe Marauder’s Map and his Invisibility Cloak from \\nhis bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the \\nmap, murmured, “ I solemnly swear that I am up to no \\ngood,” and scanned it carefully. \\n\\nAs it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students \\nwere inside their various common rooms, the \\nGryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, \\nthe Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in \\nthe basement near the kitchens. Here and there a \\nstray person meandered around the library or up a \\ncorridor. . . . There were a few people out in the \\ngrounds ... and there, alone in the seventh-floor \\ncorridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the \\nRoom of Requirement, but Harry was not worried \\nabout that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the \\nroom was open, whether the map was aware of it or \\nnot. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down \\nonly when he reached the corner into the corridor, \\nwhen he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very \\nsame little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that \\nHermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He \\nwaited until he was right behind her before bending \\nvery low and whispering, “Hello ... you’re very pretty, \\naren’t you?” \\n\\nGoyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the \\nscales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing \\nfrom sight long before the sound of the scales \\nsmashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. \\nLaughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall \\nbehind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now \\nstanding frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was \\nPage | 522 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nout there, but not daring to make an appearance. It \\ngave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he \\ntried to remember what form of words he had not yet \\ntried. \\n\\nYet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour \\nlater, having tried many more variations of his \\nrequest to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was \\njust as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond \\nbelief; Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and \\nthere was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to \\nwhat he was doing in there. Losing his patience \\ncompletely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it. \\n\\n“OUCH!” \\n\\nHe thought he might have broken his toe; as he \\nclutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility \\nCloak slipped off him. \\n\\n“Harry?” \\n\\nHe spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, \\nto his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward \\nhim as though she frequently strolled up this \\ncorridor. \\n\\n“What’re you doing here?” he said, scrambling to his \\nfeet again; why did she always have to find him lying \\non the floor? \\n\\n“I came to see Dumbledore,” said Tonks. \\n\\nHarry thought she looked terrible: thinner than \\nusual, her mouse-colored hair lank. \\n\\n“His office isn’t here,” said Harry, “it’s round the other \\nside of the castle, behind the gargoyle — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 523 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know,” said Tonks. “He’s not there. Apparently he’s \\ngone away again.” \\n\\n“Has he?” said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly \\nback on the floor. “Hey — you don’t know where he \\ngoes, I suppose?” \\n\\n“No,” said Tonks. \\n\\n“What did you want to see him about?” \\n\\n“Nothing in particular,” said Tonks, picking, \\napparently unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe. “I \\njust thought he might know what’s going on. ... I’ve \\nheard rumors ... people getting hurt ...” \\n\\n“Yeah, I know, it’s all been in the papers,” said Harry. \\n“That little kid trying to kill his — ” \\n\\n“The Prophet’s often behind the times,” said Tonks, \\nwho didn’t seem to be listening to him. “You haven’t \\nhad any letters from anyone in the Order recently?” \\n\\n“No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said \\nHarry, “not since Sirius — ” \\n\\nHe saw that her eyes had filled with tears. \\n\\n“I’m sorry,” he muttered awkwardly. “I mean ... I miss \\nhim, as well. ...” \\n\\n“What?” said Tonks blankly, as though she had not \\nheard him. “Well ... I’ll see you around, Harry ...” \\n\\nAnd she turned abruptly and walked back down the \\ncorridor, leaving Harry to stare after her. After a \\nminute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again \\nand resumed his efforts to get into the Room of \\nRequirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a \\nPage | 524 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that \\nRon and Hermione would soon be back for lunch \\nmade him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor \\nto Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave \\nfor some hours to come. \\n\\nHe found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, \\nalready halfway through an early lunch. \\n\\n“I did it — well, kind of!” Ron told Harry \\nenthusiastically when he caught sight of him. “I was \\nsupposed to be Apparating to outside Madam \\nPuddifoot’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up \\nnear Scrivenshaft’s, but at least I moved!” \\n\\n“Good one,” said Harry. “How’d you do, Hermione?” \\n\\n“Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said Ron, before \\nHermione could answer. “Perfect deliberation, \\ndivination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is \\n— we all went for a quick drink in the Three \\nBroomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross \\ngoing on about her — I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t \\npop the question soon — ” \\n\\n“And what about you?” asked Hermione, ignoring \\nRon. “Have you been up at the Room of Requirement \\nall this time?” \\n\\n“Yep,” said Harry. “And guess who I ran into up \\nthere? Tonks!” \\n\\n“Tonks?” repeated Ron and Hermione together, \\nlooking surprised. \\n\\n“Yeah, she said she’d come to visit Dumbledore. ...” \\n\\n“If you ask me,” said Ron once Harry had finished \\ndescribing his conversation with Tonks, “she’s \\n\\nPage | 525 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what \\nhappened at the Ministry.” \\n\\n“It’s a bit odd,” said Hermione, who for some reason \\nlooked very concerned. “She’s supposed to be \\nguarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning \\nher post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not \\neven here?” \\n\\n“I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively. He felt \\nstrange about voicing it; this was much more \\nHermione’s territory than his. “You don’t think she \\ncan have been . . . you know ... in love with Sirius?” \\n\\nHermione stared at him. \\n\\n“What on earth makes you say that?” \\n\\n“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging, “but she was nearly \\ncrying when I mentioned his name . . . and her \\nPatronus is a big four-legged thing now. ... I wondered \\nwhether it hadn’t become ... you know ... him.” \\n\\n“It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly. “But I still \\ndon’t know why she’d be bursting into the castle to \\nsee Dumbledore, if that’s really why she was here. ...” \\n\\n“Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who \\nwas now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. \\n“She’s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women,” he \\nsaid wisely to Harry, “they’re easily upset.” \\n\\n“And yet,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “I \\ndoubt you’d find a woman who sulked for half an \\nhour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t laugh at their \\njoke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus \\nmimbletonia.” \\n\\nRon scowled. \\n\\nPage | 526 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAFTER THE BURIAL \\n\\nPatches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear \\nover the castle turrets, but these signs of approaching \\nsummer did not lift Harry’s mood. He had been \\nthwarted, both in his attempts to find out what \\nMalfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a \\nconversation with Slughorn that might lead, \\nsomehow, to Slughorn handing over the memory he \\nhad apparently suppressed for decades. \\n\\n“For the last time, just forget about Malfoy,” Hermione \\ntold Harry firmly. \\n\\nThey were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the \\ncourtyard after lunch. Hermione and Ron were both \\nclutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet — Common \\nApparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them — for \\nthey were taking their tests that very afternoon, but \\nby and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to \\nthe nerves. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 527 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nRon gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as \\na girl came around the corner. \\n\\n“It isn’t Lavender,” said Hermione wearily. \\n\\n“Oh, good,” said Ron, relaxing. \\n\\n“Harry Potter?” said the girl. “I was asked to give you \\nthis.” \\n\\n“Thanks ...” \\n\\nHarry’s heart sank as he took the small scroll of \\nparchment. Once the girl was out of earshot he said, \\n“Dumbledore said we wouldn’t be having any more \\nlessons until I got the memory!” \\n\\n“Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?” \\nsuggested Hermione, as Harry unrolled the \\nparchment; but rather than finding Dumbledore ’s \\nlong, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy \\nsprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of \\nlarge blotches on the parchment where the ink had \\nrun. \\n\\n\\n\\nDear Harry, Ron, and Hermione, \\n\\nAragog died last night Harry and Ron, you met him, \\nand you know how special he was. Hermione, I know \\nyou’d have liked him. It would mean a lot to me if \\nyou’d nip down for the burial later this evening. I’m \\nplanning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite \\ntime of day. I know you’re not supposed to be out that \\nlate, but you can use the cloak. Wouldn’t ask, but I \\ncan’t face it alone. \\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid \\n\\nPage | 528 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Look at this,” said Harry, handing the note to \\nHermione. \\n\\n“Oh, for heaven’s sake,” she said, scanning it quickly \\nand passing it to Ron, who read it through looking \\nincreasingly incredulous. \\n\\n“He’s mentaft” he said furiously. “That thing told its \\nmates to eat Harry and me! Told them to help \\nthemselves! And now Hagrid expects us to go down \\nthere and cry over its horrible hairy body!” \\n\\n“It’s not just that,” said Hermione. “He’s asking us to \\nleave the castle at night and he knows security’s a \\nmillion times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in \\nif we were caught.” \\n\\n“We’ve been down to see him by night before,” said \\nHarry. \\n\\n“Yes, but for something like this?” said Hermione. \\n“We’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all — \\nAragog’s dead. If it were a question of saving him — ” \\n\\n“ — I’d want to go even less,” said Ron firmly. “You \\ndidn’t meet him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead \\nwill have improved him a lot.” \\n\\nHarry took the note back and stared down at all the \\ninky blotches all over it. Tears had clearly fallen thick \\nand fast upon the parchment. ... \\n\\n“Harry, you can’t be thinking of going,” said \\nHermione. “It’s such a pointless thing to get detention \\nfor.” \\n\\nHarry sighed. “Yeah, I know,” he said. “I s’pose \\nHagrid ’ll have to bury Aragog without us.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 529 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, he will,” said Hermione, looking relieved. “Look, \\nPotions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us \\nall off doing our tests. ... Try and soften Slughorn up \\na bit then!” \\n\\n“Fifty-seventh time lucky, you think?” said Harry \\nbitterly. \\n\\n“Lucky,” said Ron suddenly. “Harry, that’s it — get \\nlucky!” \\n\\n“What d’you mean?” \\n\\n“Use your lucky potion!” \\n\\n“Ron, that’s — that’s it!” said Hermione, sounding \\nstunned. “Of course! Why didn’t I think of it?” \\n\\nHarry stared at them both. “Felix Felicis?” he said. “I \\ndunno ... I was sort of saving it. ...” \\n\\n“What for?” demanded Ron incredulously. \\n\\n“What on earth is more important than this memory, \\nHarry?” asked Hermione. \\n\\nHarry did not answer. The thought of that little golden \\nbottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for \\nsome time; vague and unformulated plans that \\ninvolved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron \\nsomehow being happy to see her with a new \\nboyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his \\nbrain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the \\ntwilight time between sleeping and waking. . . . \\n\\n“Harry? Are you still with us?” asked Hermione. \\n\\n“Wha — ? Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling himself \\ntogether. “Well ... okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk \\n\\nPage | 530 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthis afternoon, I’ll take some Felix and have another \\ngo this evening.” \\n\\n“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting \\nto her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. \\n“Destination ... determination ... deliberation ...” she \\nmurmured. \\n\\n“Oh, stop that,” Ron begged her, “I feel sick enough as \\nit is — quick, hide me!” \\n\\n“It isn’t Lavender!” said Hermione impatiently, as \\nanother couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and \\nRon dived behind her. \\n\\n“Cool,” said Ron, peering over Hermione’s shoulder to \\ncheck. “Blimey, they don’t look happy, do they?” \\n\\n“They’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they \\ndon’t look happy, didn’t you hear what happened to \\ntheir little brother?” said Hermione. \\n\\n“I’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s \\nrelatives, to be honest,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Well, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The \\nrumor is that their mother refused to help the Death \\nEaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in \\nSt. Mungo’s, they couldn’t save him.” \\n\\n“He died?” repeated Harry, shocked. “But surely \\nwerewolves don’t kill, they just turn you into one of \\nthem?” \\n\\n“They sometimes kill,” said Ron, who looked \\nunusually grave now. “I’ve heard of it happening \\nwhen the werewolf gets carried away.” \\n\\n“What was the werewolf’s name?” said Harry quickly. \\n\\nPage | 531 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,” \\nsaid Hermione. \\n\\n“I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids, the \\none Lupin told me about!” said Harry angrily. \\n\\nHermione looked at him bleakly. \\n\\n“Harry, you’ve got to get that memory,” she said. “It’s \\nall about stopping Voldemort, isn’t it? These dreadful \\nthings that are happening are all down to him. ...” \\n\\nThe bell rang overhead in the castle and both \\nHermione and Ron jumped to their feet, looking \\nterrified. \\n\\n“You’ll do fine,” Harry told them both, as they headed \\ntoward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people \\ntaking their Apparition Test. “Good luck.” \\n\\n“And you too!” said Hermione with a significant look, \\nas Harry headed off to the dungeons. \\n\\nThere were only three of them in Potions that \\nafternoon: Harry, Ernie, and Draco Malfoy. \\n\\n“All too young to Apparate just yet?” said Slughorn \\ngenially. “Not turned seventeen yet?” \\n\\nThey shook their heads. \\n\\n“Ah well,” said Slughorn cheerily, “as we’re so few, \\nwe’ll do something fun. I want you all to brew me up \\nsomething amusing!” \\n\\n“That sounds good, sir,” said Ernie sycophantically, \\nrubbing his hands together. Malfoy, on the other \\nhand, did not crack a smile. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 532 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean, ‘something amusing?” he said \\nirritably. \\n\\n“Oh, surprise me,” said Slughorn airily. \\n\\nMalfoy opened his copy of Advanced Potion-Making \\nwith a sulky expression. It could not have been \\nplainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of \\ntime. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching him over \\nthe top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the \\ntime he could otherwise be spending in the Room of \\nRequirement. \\n\\nWas it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look \\nthinner? Certainly he looked paler; his skin still had \\nthat grayish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw \\ndaylight these days. But there was no air of \\nsmugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the \\nswagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, \\nwhen he had boasted openly of the mission he had \\nbeen given by Voldemort. ... There could be only one \\nconclusion, in Harry’s opinion: The mission, whatever \\nit was, was going badly. \\n\\nCheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his \\ncopy of Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily \\ncorrected Half-Blood Prince’s version of “An Elixir to \\nInduce Euphoria,” which seemed not only to meet \\nSlughorn ’s instructions, but which might (Harry’s \\nheart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn \\ninto such a good mood that he would be prepared to \\nhand over that memory if Harry could persuade him \\nto taste some. ... \\n\\n“Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,” said \\nSlughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands \\ntogether as he stared down into the sunshine yellow \\ncontents of Harry’s cauldron. “Euphoria, I take it? And \\nwhat’s that I smell? Mmmm ... you’ve added just a \\nPage | 533 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsprig of peppermint, haven’t you? Unorthodox, but \\nwhat a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that \\nwould tend to counterbalance the occasional side \\neffects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking. ... I \\nreally don’t know where you get these brain waves, \\nmy boy . . . unless — ” \\n\\nHarry pushed the Half-Blood Prince’s book deeper \\ninto his bag with his foot. \\n\\n“ — it’s just your mother’s genes coming out in you!” \\n\\n“Oh ... yeah, maybe,” said Harry, relieved. \\n\\nErnie was looking rather grumpy; determined to \\noutshine Harry for once, he had most rashly invented \\nhis own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind \\nof purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. \\nMalfoy was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn \\nhad pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely \\n“passable.” \\n\\nThe bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once. \\n\\n“Sir,” Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced \\nover his shoulder; when he saw that the room was \\nempty but for himself and Harry, he hurried away as \\nfast as he could. \\n\\n“Professor — Professor, don’t you want to taste my po \\n— ?” called Harry desperately. \\n\\nBut Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied \\nthe cauldron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, \\nand walked slowly back upstairs to the common \\nroom. \\n\\nRon and Hermione returned in the late afternoon. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 534 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Harry!” cried Hermione as she climbed through the \\nportrait hole. “Harry, I passed!” \\n\\n“Well done!” he said. “And Ron?” \\n\\n“He — he just failed,” whispered Hermione, as Ron \\ncame slouching into the room looking most morose. \\n“It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just \\nspotted that he’d left half an eyebrow behind. ... How \\ndid it go with Slughorn?” \\n\\n“No joy,” said Harry, as Ron joined them. “Bad luck, \\nmate, but you’ll pass next time — we can take it \\ntogether.” \\n\\n“Yeah, I s’pose,” said Ron grumpily. “But half an \\neyebrow\\\\ Like that matters!” \\n\\n“I know,” said Hermione soothingly, “it does seem \\nreally harsh. ...” \\n\\nThey spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the \\nApparition examiner, and Ron looked fractionally \\nmore cheerful by the time they set off back to the \\ncommon room, now discussing the continuing \\nproblem of Slughorn and the memory. \\n\\n“So, Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or \\nwhat?” Ron demanded. \\n\\n“Yeah, I s’pose I’d better,” said Harry. “I don’t reckon \\nI’ll need all of it, not twelve hours’ worth, it can’t take \\nall night. ... I’ll just take a mouthful. Two or three \\nhours should do it.” \\n\\n“It’s a great feeling when you take it,” said Ron \\nreminiscently. “Like you can’t do anything wrong.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 535 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What are you talking about?” said Hermione, \\nlaughing. “You’ve never taken any!” \\n\\n“Yeah, but I thought I had, didn’t I?” said Ron, as \\nthough explaining the obvious. “Same difference \\nreally ...” \\n\\nAs they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great \\nHall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, \\nthey lingered for a while in the common room, the \\nplan being that Harry should go to Slughorn ’s office \\nonce the teacher had had time to get back there. \\nWhen the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in \\nthe Forbidden Forest, they decided the moment had \\ncome, and after checking carefully that Neville, Dean, \\nand Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked \\nup to the boys’ dormitory. \\n\\nHarry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of \\nhis trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle. \\n\\n“Well, here goes,” said Harry, and he raised the little \\nbottle and took a carefully measured gulp. \\n\\n“What does it feel like?” whispered Hermione. \\n\\nHarry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but \\nsurely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity \\nstole through him; he felt as though he could have \\ndone anything, anything at all ... and getting the \\nmemory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only \\npossible, but positively easy. ... \\n\\nHe got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence. \\n\\n“Excellent,” he said. “Really excellent. Right ... I’m \\ngoing down to Hagrid’s.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 536 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What?” said Ron and Hermione together, looking \\naghast. \\n\\n“No, Harry — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, \\nremember?” said Hermione. \\n\\n“No,” said Harry confidently. “I’m going to Hagrid’s, \\n\\nI’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s.” \\n\\n“You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant \\nspider?” asked Ron, looking stunned. \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of \\nhis bag. “I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, you \\nknow what I mean?” \\n\\n“No,” said Ron and Hermione together, both looking \\npositively alarmed now. \\n\\n“This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?” said Hermione \\nanxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. “You \\nhaven’t got another little bottle full of — I don’t know \\n\\n\\n\\n“Essence of Insanity?” suggested Ron, as Harry \\nswung his cloak over his shoulders. \\n\\nHarry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even \\nmore alarmed. \\n\\n“Trust me,” he said. “I know what I’m doing ... or at \\nleast” — he strolled confidently to the door — “Felix \\ndoes.” \\n\\nHe pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set \\noff down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along \\nbehind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid \\nthrough the open door. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 537 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What were you doing up there with her?” shrieked \\nLavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron \\nand Hermione emerging together from the boys’ \\ndormitories. Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him \\nas he darted across the room away from them. \\n\\nGetting through the portrait hole was simple; as he \\napproached it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and \\nHarry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he \\nbrushed accidentally against Ginny. \\n\\n“Don’t push me, please, Dean,” she said, sounding \\nannoyed. “You’re always doing that, I can get through \\nperfectly well on my own. ...” \\n\\nThe portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not \\nbefore he had heard Dean make an angry retort. ... \\n\\nHis feeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off \\nthrough the castle. He did not have to creep along, for \\nhe met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise \\nhim in the slightest: This evening, he was the luckiest \\nperson at Hogwarts. \\n\\nWhy he knew that going to Hagrid’s was the right \\nthing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the \\npotion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a \\ntime: He could not see the final destination, he could \\nnot see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he \\nwas going the right way to get that memory. When he \\nreached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had \\nforgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw \\nit open and breathed in the smell of clean air and \\ngrass for a moment before walking down the steps \\ninto the dusk. \\n\\nIt was when he reached the bottom step that it \\noccurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass \\nthe vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid’s. It was not \\nstrictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that \\n\\nPage | 538 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthis was a whim on which he should act, so he \\ndirected his feet immediately toward the vegetable \\npatch, where he was pleased, but not altogether \\nsurprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation \\nwith Professor Sprout. Harry lurked behind a low \\nstone wall, feeling at peace with the world and \\nlistening to their conversation. \\n\\n“I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,” \\nSlughorn was saying courteously, “most authorities \\nagree that they are at their most efficacious if picked \\nat twilight.” \\n\\n“Oh, I quite agree,” said Professor Sprout warmly. \\n“That enough for you?” \\n\\n“Plenty, plenty,” said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was \\ncarrying an armful of leafy plants. “This should allow \\nfor a few leaves for each of my third years, and some \\nto spare if anybody over-stews them. ... Well, good \\nevening to you, and many thanks again!” \\n\\nProfessor Sprout headed off into the gathering \\ndarkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and \\nSlughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry \\nstood, invisible. \\n\\nSeized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, \\nHarry pulled off the cloak with a flourish. \\n\\n“Good evening, Professor.” \\n\\n“Merlin’s beard, Harry, you made me jump,” said \\nSlughorn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking \\nwary. “How did you get out of the castle?” \\n\\n“I think Filch must’ve forgotten to lock the doors,” \\nsaid Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see \\nSlughorn scowl. \\n\\nPage | 539 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll be reporting that man, he’s more concerned about \\nlitter than proper security if you ask me. ... But why \\nare you out here, Harry?” \\n\\n“Well, sir, it’s Hagrid,” said Harry, who knew that the \\nright thing to do just now was to tell the truth. “He’s \\npretty upset. ... But you won’t tell anyone, Professor? \\n\\nI don’t want trouble for him. ...” \\n\\nSlughorn’s curiosity was evidently aroused. “Well, I \\ncan’t promise that,” he said gruffly. “But I know that \\nDumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I’m sure he \\ncan’t be up to anything very dreadful. ...” \\n\\n“Well, it’s this giant spider, he’s had it for years. ... It \\nlived in the forest. ... It could talk and everything — ” \\n\\n“I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the \\nforest,” said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass \\nof black trees. “It’s true, then?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “But this one, Aragog, the first one \\nHagrid ever got, it died last night. He’s devastated. He \\nwants company while he buries it and I said I’d go.” \\n\\n“Touching, touching,” said Slughorn absentmindedly, \\nhis large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of \\nHagrid ’s cabin. “But acromantula venom is very \\nvaluable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet \\nhave dried out. ... Of course, I wouldn’t want to do \\nanything insensitive if Hagrid is upset . . . but if there \\nwas any way to procure some ... I mean, it’s almost \\nimpossible to get venom from an acromantula while \\nit’s alive. ...” \\n\\nSlughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than \\nHarry now. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 540 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"... seems an awful waste not to collect it ... might get \\na hundred Galleons a pint. ... To be frank, my salary \\nis not large. ...” \\n\\nAnd now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. \\n\\n“Well,” he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, \\n“well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would \\nprobably be really pleased. ... Give Aragog a better \\nsend-off, you know ...” \\n\\n“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn, his eyes now \\ngleaming with enthusiasm. “I tell you what, Harry, I’ll \\nmeet you down there with a bottle or two. ... We’ll \\ndrink the poor beast’s — well — not health — but \\nwe’ll send it off in style, anyway, once it’s buried. And \\nI’ll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the \\noccasion. ...” \\n\\nHe bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to \\nHagrid ’s, delighted with himself. \\n\\n“Yeh came,” croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door \\nand saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in \\nfront of him. \\n\\n“Yeah — Ron and Hermione couldn’t, though,” said \\nHarry. “They’re really sorry.” \\n\\n“Don’ — don’ matter ... He’d’ve bin touched yeh’re \\nhere, though, Harry. ...” \\n\\nHagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black \\narmband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot \\npolish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. \\nHarry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was \\nthe highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach. \\n\\n“Where are we burying him?” he asked. “The forest?” \\n\\nPage | 541 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Blimey, no,” said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes \\non the bottom of his shirt. “The other spiders won’ let \\nme anywhere near their webs now Aragog’s gone. \\nTurns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me! \\nCan yeh believe that, Harry?” \\n\\nThe honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with \\npainful ease the scene when he and Ron had come \\nface-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been \\nquite clear that Aragog was the only thing that \\nstopped them from eating Hagrid. \\n\\n“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” \\nsaid Hagrid, shaking his head. “It wasn’ easy, gettin’ \\nAragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh — they \\nusually eat their dead, see. ... But I wanted ter give \\n’im a nice burial ... a proper send-off ...” \\n\\nHe broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the \\npatting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the \\npotion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing \\nto do), “Professor Slughorn met me coming down \\nhere, Hagrid.” \\n\\n“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, \\nalarmed. “Yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in the \\nevenin’, I know it, it’s my fault — ” \\n\\n“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d \\nlike to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,” \\nsaid Harry. “He’s gone to change into something more \\nsuitable, I think ... and he said he’d bring some \\nbottles so we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . . \\n\\n“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and \\ntouched. “Tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ \\nnot turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really had a lot ter \\ndo with Horace Slughorn before. ... Cornin’ ter see old \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 542 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAragog off, though, eh? Well ... he ’d’ve liked that, \\nAragog would. ...” \\n\\nHarry thought privately that what Aragog would have \\nliked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of \\nedible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the \\nrear window of Hagrid ’s hut, where he saw the rather \\nhorrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its \\nback outside, its legs curled and tangled. \\n\\n“Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your \\ngarden?” \\n\\n“Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said \\nHagrid in a choked voice. “I’ve already dug the — yeh \\nknow — grave. Jus’ thought we’d say a few nice \\nthings over him — happy memories, yeh know — ” \\n\\nHis voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on \\nthe door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose \\non his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. \\nSlughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles \\nin his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat. \\n\\n“Hagrid,” he said, in a deep, grave voice. “So very \\nsorry to hear of your loss.” \\n\\n“Tha’s very nice of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Thanks a lot. \\n\\nAn’ thanks fer not givin’ Harry detention neither. ...” \\n\\n“Wouldn’t have dreamed of it,” said Slughorn. “Sad \\nnight, sad night ... Where is the poor creature?” \\n\\n“Out here,” said Hagrid in a shaking voice. “Shall we \\n— shall we do it, then?” \\n\\nThe three of them stepped out into the back garden. \\nThe moon was glistening palely through the trees \\nnow, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from \\n\\nPage | 543 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s body lying on \\nthe edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high \\nmound of freshly dug earth. \\n\\n“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the \\nspider’s head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly \\nat the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, \\nmotionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard \\nthe tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the \\npincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy \\nhead. \\n\\n“It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” \\nsaid Hagrid to Slughorn ’s back, tears leaking from the \\ncorners of his crinkled eyes. “I didn’ know yeh were \\nint’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.” \\n\\n“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said \\nSlughorn, stepping back from the body. Harry saw \\nthe glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak, \\nthough Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed \\nnothing. “Now ... shall we proceed to the burial?” \\n\\nHagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the \\ngigantic spider into his arms and, with an enormous \\ngrunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with \\na rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry \\nagain. \\n\\n“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” \\nsaid Slughorn, who like Harry could reach no higher \\nthan Hagrid’s elbow, but patted it all the same. “Why \\ndon’t I say a few words?” \\n\\nHe must have got a lot of good quality venom from \\nAragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied \\nsmirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, \\nin a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell, Aragog, king of \\narachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those \\nPage | 544 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwho knew you won’t forget! Though your body will \\ndecay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun \\nplaces of your forest home. May your many-eyed \\ndescendants ever flourish and your human friends \\nfind solace for the loss they have sustained.” \\n\\n“Tha’ was ... tha’ was ... beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, \\nand he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying \\nharder than ever. \\n\\n“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so \\nthat the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with \\na muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming \\na smooth mound. “Let’s get inside and have a drink. \\nGet on his other side, Harry. ... That’s it. ... Up you \\ncome, Hagrid ... Well done ...” \\n\\nThey deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, \\nwho had been skulking in his basket during the \\nburial, now came padding softly across to them and \\nput his heavy head into Harry’s lap as usual. \\n\\nSlughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had \\nbrought. \\n\\n“I have had it all tested for poison,” he assured Harry, \\npouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid ’s \\nbucket- sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. “Had a \\nhouse-elf taste every bottle after what happened to \\nyour poor friend Rupert.” \\n\\nHarry saw, in his mind’s eye, the expression on \\nHermione’s face if she ever heard about this abuse of \\nhouse-elves, and decided never to mention it to her. \\n\\n“One for Harry ...” said Slughorn, dividing a second \\nbottle between two mugs, \"... and one for me. Well” — \\nhe raised his mug high — “to Aragog.” \\n\\n“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together. \\n\\nPage | 545 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, \\nhowever, with the way ahead illuminated for him by \\nFelix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he \\nmerely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug \\nback on the table before him. \\n\\n“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid \\nmorosely. “Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. \\nBout the size of a Pekingese.” \\n\\n“Sweet,” said Slughorn. \\n\\n“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school \\nuntil ... well ...” \\n\\nHagrid ’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom \\nRiddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of \\nschool, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. \\nSlughorn, however, did not seem to be listening; he \\nwas looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of \\nbrass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright \\nwhite hair. \\n\\n“That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?” \\n\\n“Oh, yeah,” said Hagrid indifferently. “Gets pulled out \\nof their tails, they catch it on branches an’ stuff in the \\nforest, yeh know ...” \\n\\n“But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s \\nworth?” \\n\\n“I use it fer bindin’ on bandages an’ stuff if a creature \\ngets injured,” said Hagrid, shrugging. “It’s dead useful \\n... very strong, see.” \\n\\nSlughorn took another deep draught from his mug, \\nhis eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, \\nlooking, Harry knew, for more treasures that he might \\n\\nPage | 546 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbe able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak- \\nmatured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet \\nsmoking jackets. He refilled Hagrid’s mug and his \\nown, and questioned him about the creatures that \\nlived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was \\nable to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming \\nexpansive under the influence of the drink and \\nSlughorn ’s flattering interest, stopped mopping his \\neyes and entered happily into a long explanation of \\nbowtruckle husbandry. \\n\\nThe Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this \\npoint, and he noticed that the supply of drink that \\nSlughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry \\nhad not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm \\nwithout saying the incantation aloud, but the idea \\nthat he might not be able to do it tonight was \\nlaughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, \\nunnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn (now \\nswapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he \\npointed his wand under the table at the emptying \\nbottles and they immediately began to refill. \\n\\nAfter an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began \\nmaking extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to \\nDumbledore, to elf-made wine, and to — \\n\\n“Harry Potter!” bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his \\nfourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he \\ndrained it. \\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” cried Slughorn a little thickly, “Parry \\nOtter, the Chosen Boy Who — well — something of \\nthat sort,” he mumbled, and drained his mug too. \\n\\nNot long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and \\npressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who \\npocketed it with cries of, “To friendship! To generosity! \\nTo ten Galleons a hair!” \\n\\nPage | 547 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were \\nsitting side by side, arms around each other, singing \\na slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo. \\n\\n“Aaargh, the good die young,” muttered Hagrid, \\nslumping low onto the table, a little cross-eyed, while \\nSlughorn continued to warble the refrain. “Me dad \\nwas no age ter go ... nor were yer mum an’ dad, \\nHarry...” \\n\\nGreat fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid ’s \\ncrinkled eyes again; he grasped Harry’s arm and \\nshook it. \\n\\n“Bes’ wiz and witchard o’ their age I never knew ... \\nterrible thing ... terrible thing ...” \\n\\nAnd Odo the hero, they bore him back home \\nTo the place that he’d known as a lad, \\n\\nsang Slughorn plaintively. \\n\\nThey laid him to rest with his hat inside out \\nAnd his wand snapped in two, which was sad. \\n\\n\"... terrible,” Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy \\nhead rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, \\nsnoring deeply. \\n\\n“Sorry,” said Slughorn with a hiccup. “Can’t carry a \\ntune to save my life.” \\n\\n“Hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing,” said Harry \\nquietly. “He was talking about my mum and dad \\ndying.” \\n\\n“Oh,” said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. “Oh \\ndear. Yes, that was — was terrible indeed. Terrible ... \\nterrible ...” \\n\\nPage | 548 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted \\nto refilling their mugs. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, Harry?” he \\nasked awkwardly. \\n\\n“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said \\nHarry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in \\nHagrid’s heavy snores. “But I’ve found out pretty \\nmuch what happened since. My dad died first. Did \\nyou know that?” \\n\\n“I — I didn’t,” said Slughorn in a hushed voice. \\n\\n“Yeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped \\nover his body toward my mum,” said Harry. \\n\\nSlughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem \\nable to tear his horrified gaze away from Harry’s face. \\n\\n“He told her to get out of the way,” said Harry \\nremorselessly. “He told me she needn’t have died. He \\nonly wanted me. She could have run.” \\n\\n“Oh dear,” breathed Slughorn. “She could have ... she \\nneedn’t ... That’s awful. ...” \\n\\n“It is, isn’t it?” said Harry, in a voice barely more than \\na whisper. “But she didn’t move. Dad was already \\ndead, but she didn’t want me to go too. She tried to \\nplead with Voldemort ... but he just laughed. ...” \\n\\n“That’s enough!” said Slughorn suddenly, raising a \\nshaking hand. “Really, my dear boy, enough ... I’m an \\nold man ... I don’t need to hear ... I don’t want to hear \\n\\n\\n\\n“I forgot,” lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. \\n\\n“You liked her, didn’t you?” \\n\\nPage | 549 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Liked her?” said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with \\ntears once more. “I don’t imagine anyone who met her \\nwouldn’t have liked her. ... Very brave ... Very funny \\n...It was the most horrible thing. ...” \\n\\n“But you won’t help her son,” said Harry. “She gave \\nme her life, but you won’t give me a memory.” \\n\\nHagrid’s rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry \\nlooked steadily into Slughorn ’s tear-filled eyes. The \\nPotions master seemed unable to look away. \\n\\n“Don’t say that,” he whispered. “It isn’t a question ... \\n\\nIf it were to help you, of course ... but no purpose can \\nbe served ...” \\n\\n“It can,” said Harry clearly. “Dumbledore needs \\ninformation. I need information.” \\n\\nHe knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that \\nSlughorn would remember nothing of this in the \\nmorning. Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry \\nleaned forward a little. \\n\\n“I am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that \\nmemory.” \\n\\nSlughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead \\ngleamed with sweat. \\n\\n“You are the Chosen One?” \\n\\n“Of course I am,” said Harry calmly. \\n\\n“But then ... my dear boy ... you’re asking a great deal \\n... you’re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your \\nattempt to destroy — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 550 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily \\nEvans?” \\n\\n“Harry, Harry, of course I do, but — ” \\n\\n“You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?” \\n\\nSlughorn said nothing; he looked terrified. \\n\\n“Be brave like my mother, Professor. ...” \\n\\nSlughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his \\nshaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment \\nlike an enormously overgrown baby. \\n\\n“I am not proud ...” he whispered through his fingers. \\n“I am ashamed of what — of what that memory \\nshows. ... I think I may have done great damage that \\nday. ...” \\n\\n“You’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the \\nmemory,” said Harry. “It would be a very brave and \\nnoble thing to do.” \\n\\nHagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn \\nand Harry stared at each other over the guttering \\ncandle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix \\nFelicis told Harry not to break it, to wait. \\n\\nThen, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his \\npocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other \\nhand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty \\nbottle. Still looking into Harry’s eyes, Slughorn \\ntouched the tip of his wand to his temple and \\nwithdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory \\ncame away too, clinging to the wand tip. Longer and \\nlonger the memory stretched until it broke and \\nswung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn \\nlowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, \\nPage | 551 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nswirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a \\ntrembling hand and then passed it across the table to \\nHarry. \\n\\n“Thank you very much, Professor.” \\n\\n“You’re a good boy,” said Professor Slughorn, tears \\ntrickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus \\nmustache. “And you’ve got her eyes. ... Just don’t \\nthink too badly of me once you’ve seen it. ...” \\n\\nAnd he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep \\nsigh, and fell asleep. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 552 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHORCRUXES \\n\\nHarry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he \\ncrept back into the castle. The front door had \\nremained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he \\nmet Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by \\ndiving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the \\ntime he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and \\npulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised \\nto find her in a most unhelpful mood. \\n\\n“What sort of time do you call this?” \\n\\n“I’m really sorry — I had to go out for something \\nimportant — ” \\n\\n“Well, the password changed at midnight, so you’ll \\njust have to sleep in the corridor, won’t you?” \\n\\n“You’re joking!” said Harry. “Why did it have to \\nchange at midnight?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 553 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s the way it is,” said the Fat Lady. “If you’re \\nangry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he’s the \\none who’s tightened security.” \\n\\n“Fantastic,” said Harry bitterly, looking around at the \\nhard floor. “Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take \\nit up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he’s \\nthe one who wanted me to — ” \\n\\n“He is here,” said a voice behind Harry. “Professor \\nDumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.” \\n\\nNearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his \\nhead wobbling as usual upon his ruff. \\n\\n“I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,” \\nsaid Nick. “He appeared, according to the Baron, to be \\nin good spirits, though a little tired, of course.” \\n\\n“Where is he?” said Harry, his heart leaping. \\n\\n“Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy \\nTower, it’s a favorite pastime of his — ” \\n\\n“Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!” \\n\\n“Oh — in his office,” said Nick. “I believe, from what \\nthe Baron said, that he had business to attend to \\nbefore turning in — ” \\n\\n“Yeah, he has,” said Harry, excitement blazing in his \\nchest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had \\nsecured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted \\noff again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after \\nhim. \\n\\n“Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke \\nme up! The password’s still ‘tapeworm’!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 554 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Harry was already hurtling back along the \\ncorridor and within minutes, he was saying “toffee \\neclairs” to Dumbledore’s gargoyle, which leapt aside, \\npermitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. \\n\\n“Enter,” said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He \\nsounded exhausted. \\n\\nHarry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore’s \\noffice, looking the same as ever, but with black, star- \\nstrewn skies beyond the windows. \\n\\n“Good gracious, Harry,” said Dumbledore in surprise. \\n“To what do I owe this very late pleasure?” \\n\\n“Sir — I’ve got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.” \\n\\nHarry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to \\nDumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster \\nlooked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. \\n\\n“Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done \\nindeed! I knew you could do it!” \\n\\nAll thought of the lateness of the hour apparently \\nforgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle \\nwith Slughorn’s memory in his uninjured hand, and \\nstrode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve. \\n\\n“And now,” said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin \\nupon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle \\ninto it. “Now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly ...” \\n\\nHarry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his \\nfeet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell \\nthrough darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn’s \\noffice many years before. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 555 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was the much younger Slughorn, with his \\nthick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond \\nmustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged \\narmchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet \\npouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other \\nrummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple. And \\nthere were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around \\nSlughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, \\nMarvolo’s gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. \\n\\nDumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle \\nasked, “Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is \\nretiring?” \\n\\n“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said \\nSlughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, \\nthough winking at the same time. “I must say, I’d like \\nto know where you get your information, boy, more \\nknowledgeable than half the staff, you are.” \\n\\nRiddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him \\nadmiring looks. \\n\\n“What with your uncanny ability to know things you \\nshouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the people who \\nmatter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, \\nyou’re quite right, it is my favorite — ” \\n\\nSeveral of the boys tittered again. \\n\\n“ — I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of \\nMagic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep \\nsending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the \\nMinistry.” \\n\\nTom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed \\nagain. Harry noticed that he was by no means the \\neldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed \\nto look to him as their leader. \\n\\nPage | 556 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know that politics would suit me, sir,” he said \\nwhen the laughter had died away. “I don’t have the \\nright kind of background, for one thing.” \\n\\nA couple of the boys around him smirked at each \\nother. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private \\njoke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or \\nsuspected, regarding their gang leader’s famous \\nancestor. \\n\\n“Nonsense,” said Slughorn briskly, “couldn’t be \\nplainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, \\nabilities like yours. No, you’ll go far, Tom, I’ve never \\nbeen wrong about a student yet.” \\n\\nThe small golden clock standing upon Slughorn ’s \\ndesk chimed eleven o’clock behind him and he looked \\naround. \\n\\n“Good gracious, is it that time already? You’d better \\nget going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I \\nwant your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same \\ngoes for you, Avery.” \\n\\nOne by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn \\nheaved himself out of his armchair and carried his \\nempty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him \\nmade him look around; Riddle was still standing \\nthere. \\n\\n“Look sharp, Tom, you don’t want to be caught out of \\nbed out of hours, and you a prefect ...” \\n\\n“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.” \\n\\n“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. ...” \\n\\n“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about \\nHorcruxes?” \\n\\nPage | 557 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlughorn stared at him, his thick fingers \\nabsentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass. \\n\\n“Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?” \\n\\nBut Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well \\nthat this was not schoolwork. \\n\\n“Not exactly, sir,” said Riddle. “I came across the term \\nwhile reading and I didn’t fully understand it.” \\n\\n“No ... well ... you’d be hard-pushed to find a book at \\nHogwarts that’ll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, \\nthat’s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,” said \\nSlughorn. \\n\\n“But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, \\na wizard like you — sorry, I mean, if you can’t tell me, \\nobviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me, you \\ncould — so I just thought I’d ask — ” \\n\\nIt was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, \\nthe casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it \\noverdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of \\ntrying to wheedle information out of reluctant people \\nnot to recognize a master at work. He could tell that \\nRiddle wanted the information very, very much; \\nperhaps had been working toward this moment for \\nweeks. \\n\\n“Well,” said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but \\nfiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of \\ncrystalized pineapple, “well, it can’t hurt to give you \\nan overview, of course. Just so that you understand \\nthe term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in \\nwhich a person has concealed part of their soul.” \\n\\n“I don’t quite understand how that works, though, \\nsir,” said Riddle. \\n\\nPage | 558 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHis voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could \\nsense his excitement. \\n\\n“Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, \\n“and hide part of it in an object outside the body. \\nThen, even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed, one \\ncannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound \\nand undamaged. But of course, existence in such a \\nform ...” \\n\\nSlughorn ’s face crumpled and Harry found himself \\nremembering words he had heard nearly two years \\nbefore: “ I was ripped from my body, I was less than \\nspirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was \\nalive.” \\n\\n“... few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be \\npreferable.” \\n\\nBut Riddle’s hunger was now apparent; his \\nexpression was greedy, he could no longer hide his \\nlonging. \\n\\n“How do you split your soul?” \\n\\n“Well,” said Slughorn uncomfortably, “you must \\nunderstand that the soul is supposed to remain intact \\nand whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is \\nagainst nature.” \\n\\n“But how do you do it?” \\n\\n“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By \\ncommitting murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The \\nwizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the \\ndamage to his advantage: He would encase the torn \\nportion — ” \\n\\n“Encase? But how — ?” \\n\\nPage | 559 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said \\nSlughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant \\nbothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I have \\ntried it — do I look like a killer?” \\n\\n“No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly. “I’m sorry \\n...I didn’t mean to offend ...” \\n\\n“Not at all, not at all, not offended,” said Slughorn \\ngruffly. “It’s natural to feel some curiosity about these \\nthings. ... Wizards of a certain caliber have always \\nbeen drawn to that aspect of magic. ...” \\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Riddle. “What I don’t understand, \\nthough — just out of curiosity — I mean, would one \\nHorcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul \\nonce? Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to \\nhave your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, \\nisn’t seven the most powerfully magical number, \\nwouldn’t seven — ?” \\n\\n“Merlin’s beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn. “Seven! Isn’t \\nit bad enough to think of killing one person? And in \\nany case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to \\nrip it into seven pieces ...” \\n\\nSlughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing \\nat Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly \\nbefore, and Harry could tell that he was regretting \\nentering into the conversation at all. \\n\\n“Of course,” he muttered, “this is all hypothetical, \\nwhat we’re discussing, isn’t it? All academic ...” \\n\\n“Yes, sir, of course,” said Riddle quickly. \\n\\n“But all the same, Tom ... keep it quiet, what I’ve told \\n— that’s to say, what we’ve discussed. People \\nwouldn’t like to think we’ve been chatting about \\n\\nPage | 560 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHorcruxes. It’s a banned subject at Hogwarts, you \\nknow. ... Dumbledore’s particularly fierce about it. ...” \\n\\n“I won’t say a word, sir,” said Riddle, and he left, but \\nnot before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was \\nfull of that same wild happiness it had worn when he \\nhad first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of \\nhappiness that did not enhance his handsome \\nfeatures, but made them, somehow, less human. ... \\n\\n“Thank you, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Let us \\ngo. ...” \\' \\n\\nWhen Harry landed back on the office floor \\nDumbledore was already sitting down behind his \\ndesk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to \\nspeak. \\n\\n“I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a \\nvery long time,” said Dumbledore at last. “It confirms \\nthe theory on which I have been working, it tells me \\nthat I am right, and also how very far there is still to \\ngo. ...” \\n\\nHarry suddenly noticed that every single one of the \\nold headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits \\naround the walls was awake and listening in on their \\nconversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had \\nactually taken out an ear trumpet. \\n\\n“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “I am sure you \\nunderstood the significance of what we just heard. At \\nthe same age as you are now, give or take a few \\nmonths, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out \\nhow to make himself immortal.” \\n\\n“You think he succeeded then, sir?” asked Harry. “He \\nmade a Horcrux? And that’s why he didn’t die when \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 561 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden \\nsomewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?” \\n\\n“A bit ... or more,” said Dumbledore. “You heard \\nVoldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace \\nwas an opinion on what would happen to the wizard \\nwho created more than one Horcrux, what would \\nhappen to the wizard so determined to evade death \\nthat he would be prepared to murder many times, rip \\nhis soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, \\nseparately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have \\ngiven him that information. As far as I know — as far, \\nI am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever \\ndone more than tear his soul in two.” \\n\\nDumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his \\nthoughts, and then said, “Four years ago, I received \\nwhat I considered certain proof that Voldemort had \\nsplit his soul.” \\n\\n“Where?” asked Harry “How?” \\n\\n“You handed it to me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “The \\ndiary, Riddle’s diary, the one giving instructions on \\nhow to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.” \\n\\n“I don’t understand, sir,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out \\nof the diary, what you described to me was a \\nphenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory \\nstarting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, \\nsapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had \\nfallen? No, something much more sinister had lived \\ninside that book. ... a fragment of soul, I was almost \\nsure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this \\nraised as many questions as it answered. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 562 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that \\ndiary had been intended as a weapon as much as a \\nsafeguard.” \\n\\n“I still don’t understand,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — \\nin other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside \\nit was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part \\nin preventing the death of its owner. But there could \\nbe no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, \\nwanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess \\nsomebody else, so that Slytherin’s monster would be \\nunleashed again.” \\n\\n“Well, he didn’t want his hard work to be wasted,” \\nsaid Harry. “He wanted people to know he was \\nSlytherin’s heir, because he couldn’t take credit at the \\ntime.” \\n\\n“Quite correct,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “But don’t \\nyou see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be \\npassed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts \\nstudent, he was being remarkably blase about that \\nprecious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The \\npoint of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn \\nexplained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, \\nnot to fling it into somebody else’s path and run the \\nrisk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: \\nThat particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw \\nto that. \\n\\n“The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this \\nHorcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested \\nthat he must have made — or been planning to make \\n— more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would \\nnot be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but \\nnothing else seemed to make sense. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 563 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then you told me, two years later, that on the night \\nthat Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most \\nilluminating and alarming statement to his Death \\nEaters. % who have gone further than anybody along \\nthe path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you \\ntold me he said. ‘Further than anybody,’ And I thought \\nI knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did \\nnot. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in \\nthe plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other \\nwizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has \\nseemed to grow less human with the passing years, \\nand the transformation he has undergone seemed to \\nme to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated \\nbeyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’ \\n\\n\\n\\n“So he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering \\nother people?” said Harry. “Why couldn’t he make a \\nSorcerer’s Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested \\nin immortality?” \\n\\n“Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years \\nago,” said Dumbledore. “But there are several reasons \\nwhy, I think, a Sorcerer’s Stone would appeal less \\nthan Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort. \\n\\n“While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it \\nmust be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker \\nis to maintain their immortality. Therefore, Voldemort \\nwould be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it \\nran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was \\nstolen, he would die just like any other man. \\nVoldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe \\nthat he would have found the thought of being \\ndependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course \\nhe was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of \\nthe horrible part-life to which he was condemned \\nafter attacking you, but only to regain a body. \\nThereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to \\nPage | 564 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if \\nonly he could regain a human form. He was already \\nimmortal, you see ... or as close to immortal as any \\nman can be. \\n\\n“But now, Harry, armed with this information, the \\ncrucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for \\nus, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord \\nVoldemort than anyone has ever been before. You \\nheard him, Harry: ‘Wouldn’t it be better, make you \\nstronger, to have your soul in more pieces ... isn’t \\nseven the most powerfully magical number ...’ Isn’t \\nseven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I \\nthink the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly \\nappeal to Lord Voldemort.” \\n\\n“He made seven Horcruxes?” said Harry, horror- \\nstruck, while several of the portraits on the walls \\nmade similar noises of shock and outrage. “But they \\ncould be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or \\ninvisible — ” \\n\\n“I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the \\nproblem,” said Dumbledore calmly. “But firstly, no, \\nHarry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of \\nhis soul, however maimed, resides inside his \\nregenerated body. That was the part of him that lived \\na spectral existence for so many years during his \\nexile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh \\npiece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to \\nkill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in \\nhis body.” \\n\\n“But the six Horcruxes, then,” said Harry, a little \\ndesperately, “how are we supposed to find them?” \\n\\n“You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one \\nof them. And I have destroyed another.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 565 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have?” said Harry eagerly. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he raised his \\nblackened, burned-looking hand. “The ring, Harry. \\nMarvolo’s ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it \\ntoo. Had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly \\nmodesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for \\nProfessor Snape’s timely action when I returned to \\nHogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived \\nto tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not \\nseem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of \\nVoldemort’s soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.” \\n\\n“But how did you find it?” \\n\\n“Well, as you now know, for many years I have made \\nit my business to discover as much as I can about \\nVoldemort’s past life. I have traveled widely, visiting \\nthose places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring \\nhidden in the ruin of the Gaunts’ house. It seems that \\nonce Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of \\nhis soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. \\nHe hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, \\nin the shack where his ancestors had once lived \\n(Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), \\nnever guessing that I might one day take the trouble \\nto visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye \\nopen for traces of magical concealment. \\n\\n“However, we should not congratulate ourselves too \\nheartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if \\nwe are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four \\nHorcruxes remain.” \\n\\n“And they could be anything?” said Harry. “They \\ncould be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion \\nbottles. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 566 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be \\nordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord \\nVoldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard \\nhis own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have \\nshowed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, \\nand he preferred objects with a powerful magical \\nhistory. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, \\nhis determination to carve for himself a startling place \\nin magical history; these things suggest to me that \\nVoldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with \\nsome care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.” \\n\\n“The diary wasn’t that special.” \\n\\n“The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that \\nhe was the Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that \\nVoldemort considered it of stupendous importance.” \\n\\n“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think \\nyou know what they are, sir?” \\n\\n“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons \\nI have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort \\nwould prefer objects that, in themselves, have a \\ncertain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back \\nthrough Voldemort’s past to see if I can find evidence \\nthat such artifacts have disappeared around him.” \\n\\n“The locket!” said Harry loudly. “Hufflepuff’s cup!” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared \\nto bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple \\nof fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and \\nfour. The remaining two, assuming again that he \\ncreated a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will \\nhazard a guess that, having secured objects from \\nHufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down \\nobjects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four \\nobjects from the four founders would, I am sure, have \\nPage | 567 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nexerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination. \\n\\nI cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find \\nanything of Ravenclaw’s. I am confident, however, \\nthat the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.” \\n\\nDumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall \\nbehind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed \\nwithin a glass case. \\n\\n“Do you think that’s why he really wanted to come \\nback to Hogwarts, sir?” said Harry. “To try and find \\nsomething from one of the other founders?” \\n\\n“My thoughts precisely,” said Dumbledore. “But \\nunfortunately, that does not advance us much \\nfurther, for he was turned away, or so I believe, \\nwithout the chance to search the school. I am forced \\nto conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of \\ncollecting four founders’ objects. He definitely had two \\n— he may have found three — that is the best we can \\ndo for now.” \\n\\n“Even if he got something of Ravenclaw’s or of \\nGryffindor’s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,” said Harry, \\ncounting on his fingers. “Unless he got both?” \\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore. “I think I know \\nwhat the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say \\nwhen I confess that I have been curious for a while \\nabout the behavior of the snake, Nagini?” \\n\\n“The snake?” said Harry, startled. “You can use \\nanimals as Horcruxes?” \\n\\n“Well, it is inadvisable to do so,” said Dumbledore, \\n“because to confide a part of your soul to something \\nthat can think and move for itself is obviously a very \\nrisky business. However, if my calculations are \\ncorrect, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short \\nPage | 568 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof his goal of six when he entered your parents’ house \\nwith the intention of killing you. \\n\\n\\n\\n“He seems to have reserved the process of making \\nHorcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You \\nwould certainly have been that. He believed that in \\nkilling you, he was destroying the danger the \\nprophecy had outlined. He believed he was making \\nhimself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to \\nmake his final Horcrux with your death. \\n\\n“As we know, he failed. After an interval of some \\nyears, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle \\nman, and it might then have occurred to him to turn \\nher into his last Horcrux. She underlines the \\nSlytherin connection, which enhances Lord \\nVoldemort’s mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of \\nher as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to \\nkeep her close, and he seems to have an unusual \\namount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.” \\n\\n“So,” said Harry, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. \\n\\nThe cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, \\nand you think there might be a Horcrux that was \\nonce Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s?” \\n\\n“An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,” \\nsaid Dumbledore, bowing his head. \\n\\n“So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where \\nyou’ve been going when you’ve been leaving the \\nschool?” \\n\\n“Correct,” said Dumbledore. “I have been looking for a \\nvery long time. I think ... perhaps ... I may be close to \\nfinding another one. There are hopeful signs.” \\n\\n“And if you do,” said Harry quickly, “can I come with \\nyou and help get rid of it?” \\n\\nPage | 569 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a \\nmoment before saying, “Yes, I think so.” \\n\\n“I can?” said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. \\n\\n“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. “I think \\nyou have earned that right.” \\n\\nHarry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear \\nwords of caution and protection for once. The \\nheadmasters and headmistresses around the walls \\nseemed less impressed by Dumbledore’s decision; \\nHarry saw a few of them shaking their heads and \\nPhineas Nigellus actually snorted. \\n\\n“Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, \\nsir? Can he feel it?” Harry asked, ignoring the \\nportraits. \\n\\n“A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I \\nbelieve that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, \\nand these crucial parts of himself have been detached \\nfor so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the \\npoint of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he \\nwas not aware, for instance, that the diary had been \\ndestroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius \\nMalfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary \\nhad been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am \\ntold that his anger was terrible to behold.” \\n\\n“But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it \\ninto Hogwarts?” \\n\\n“Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would \\nbe able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was \\nsupposed to wait for Voldemort’s say-so, and he never \\nreceived it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving \\nhim the diary. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 570 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do \\nanything with the Horcrux other than guard it \\ncarefully, but he was counting too much upon \\nLucius’s fear of a master who had been gone for years \\nand whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius \\ndid not know what the diary really was. I understand \\nthat Voldemort had told him the diary would cause \\nthe Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was \\ncleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a \\nportion of his master’s soul in his hands, he would \\nundoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — \\nbut instead he went ahead and carried out the old \\nplan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon \\nArthur Weasley’s daughter, he hoped to discredit \\nArthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical \\nobject in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius ... what with \\nVoldemort ’s fury about the fact that he threw away \\nthe Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the \\nMinistry last year, I would not be surprised if he is \\nnot secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the \\nmoment.” \\n\\nHarry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if \\nall of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be \\nkilled?” \\n\\n“Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his \\nHorcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a \\nmaimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, \\nthat while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, \\nhis brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will \\ntake uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like \\nVoldemort even without his Horcruxes.” \\n\\n“But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said \\nHarry, before he could stop himself. \\n\\n“Yes, you have,” said Dumbledore firmly. “You have a \\npower that Voldemort has never had. You can — ” \\n\\nPage | 571 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know!” said Harry impatiently. “I can love!” It was \\nonly with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \\n“Big deal!” \\n\\n“Yes, Harry, you can love,” said Dumbledore, who \\nlooked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry \\nhad just refrained from saying. “Which, given \\neverything that has happened to you, is a great and \\nremarkable thing. You are still too young to \\nunderstand how unusual you are, Harry.” \\n\\n“So, when the prophecy says that I’ll have ‘power the \\nDark Lord knows not,’ it just means — love?” asked \\nHarry, feeling a little let down. \\n\\n“Yes — just love,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry, never \\nforget that what the prophecy says is only significant \\nbecause Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the \\nend of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the \\nperson who would be most dangerous to him — and \\nin doing so, he made you the person who would be \\nmost dangerous to him!” \\n\\n“But it comes to the same — ” \\n\\n“No, it doesn’t!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient \\nnow. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, \\nhe said, “You are setting too much store by the \\nprophecy!” \\n\\n“But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy \\nmeans — ” \\n\\n“If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would \\nit have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? \\nOf course not! Do you think every prophecy in the \\nHall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 572 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But,” said Harry, bewildered, “but last year, you said \\none of us would have to kill the other — ” \\n\\n“Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave \\nerror, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s words! If \\nVoldemort had never murdered your father, would he \\nhave imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of \\ncourse not! If he had not forced your mother to die for \\nyou, would he have given you a magical protection he \\ncould not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don’t you \\nsee? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just \\nas tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how \\nmuch tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of \\nthem realize that, one day, amongst their many \\nvictims, there is sure to be one who rises against \\nthem and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! \\nAlways he was on the lookout for the one who would \\nchallenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt \\ninto action, with the result that he not only \\nhandpicked the man most likely to finish him, he \\nhanded him uniquely deadly weapons!” \\n\\n“But — ” \\n\\n“It is essential that you understand this!” said \\nDumbledore, standing up and striding about the \\nroom, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; \\nHarry had never seen him so agitated. “By attempting \\nto kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the \\nremarkable person who sits here in front of me, and \\ngave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort ’s fault \\nthat you were able to see into his thoughts, his \\nambitions, that you even understand the snakelike \\nlanguage in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, \\ndespite your privileged insight into Voldemort’s world \\n(which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would \\nkill to have), you have never been seduced by the \\nDark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 573 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nslightest desire to become one of Voldemort’s \\nfollowers!” \\n\\n“Of course I haven’t!” said Harry indignantly. “He \\nkilled my mum and dad!” \\n\\n“You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” \\nsaid Dumbledore loudly. “The only protection that can \\npossibly work against the lure of power like \\nVoldemort’s! In spite of all the temptation you have \\nendured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, \\njust as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when \\nyou stared into a mirror that reflected your heart’s \\ndesire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord \\nVoldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have \\nyou any idea how few wizards could have seen what \\nyou saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have \\nknown then what he was dealing with, but he did not! \\n\\n“But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord \\nVoldemort’s mind without damage to yourself, but he \\ncannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, \\nas he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he \\nunderstands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a \\nhurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to \\nunderstand the incomparable power of a soul that is \\nuntarnished and whole.” \\n\\n“But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to \\nsound argumentative, “it all comes to the same thing, \\ndoesn’t it? I’ve got to try and kill him, or — ” \\n\\n“Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you’ve got to! \\nBut not because of the prophecy! Because you, \\nyourself, will never rest until you’ve tried! We both \\nknow it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you \\nhad never heard that prophecy! How would you feel \\nabout Voldemort now? Think!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 574 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in \\nfront of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, \\nhis father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. \\nHe thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord \\nVoldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside \\nhis chest, searing his throat. \\n\\n“I’d want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I’d \\nwant to do it.” \\n\\n“Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, \\nthe prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! \\nBut the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you \\nas his equal. ... In other words, you are free to choose \\nyour way, quite free to turn your back on the \\nprophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the \\nprophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which \\nmakes it certain, really, that — ” \\n\\n“That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” \\nsaid Harry. “Yes.” \\n\\nBut he understood at last what Dumbledore had been \\ntrying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference \\nbetween being dragged into the arena to face a battle \\nto the death and walking into the arena with your \\nhead held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that \\nthere was little to choose between the two ways, but \\nDumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with \\na rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that \\nthere was all the difference in the world. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 575 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSECTUMSEMPRA \\n\\nExhausted but delighted with his night’s work, Harry \\ntold Ron and Hermione everything that had happened \\nduring next morning’s Charms lesson (having first \\ncast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them). \\nThey were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he \\nhad wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and \\npositively awed when he told them about Voldemort’s \\nHorcruxes and Dumbledore’s promise to take Harry \\nalong, should he find another one. \\n\\n“Wow,” said Ron, when Harry had finally finished \\ntelling them everything; Ron was waving his wand \\nvery vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without \\npaying the slightest bit of attention to what he was \\ndoing. “Wow. You’re actually going to go with \\nDumbledore ... and try and destroy ... wow.” \\n\\n“Ron, you’re making it snow,” said Hermione \\npatiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand \\naway from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large \\nwhite flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 576 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring \\ntable through very red eyes, and Hermione \\nimmediately let go of Ron’s arm. \\n\\n“Oh yeah,” said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in \\nvague surprise. “Sorry ... looks like we’ve all got \\nhorrible dandruff now. ...” \\n\\nHe brushed some of the fake snow off Hermione ’s \\nshoulder. Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked \\nimmensely guilty and turned his back on her. \\n\\n“We split up,” he told Harry out of the corner of his \\nmouth. “Last night. When she saw me coming out of \\nthe dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn’t \\nsee you, so she thought it had just been the two of \\nus.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah,” said Harry. “Well — you don’t mind it’s over, do \\nyou?” \\n\\n“No,” Ron admitted. “It was pretty bad while she was \\nyelling, but at least I didn’t have to finish it.” \\n\\n“Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused. \\n“Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. \\nGinny and Dean split up too, Harry.” \\n\\nHarry thought there was a rather knowing look in her \\neye as she told him that, but she could not possibly \\nknow that his insides were suddenly dancing the \\nconga. Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as \\nindifferent as he could, he asked, “How come?” \\n\\n“Oh, something really silly . . . She said he was always \\ntrying to help her through the portrait hole, like she \\ncouldn’t climb in herself ... but they’ve been a bit \\nrocky for ages.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 577 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the \\nclassroom. He certainly looked unhappy. \\n\\n“Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, \\ndoesn’t it?” said Hermione. \\n\\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. \\n\\n“The Quidditch team,” said Hermione. “If Ginny and \\nDean aren’t speaking ...” \\n\\n“Oh — oh yeah,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Flitwick,” said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little \\nCharms master was bobbing his way toward them, \\nand Hermione was the only one who had managed to \\nturn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep \\ncrimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry’s and \\nRon’s were still murky brown. \\n\\n“Now, now, boys,” squeaked Professor Flitwick \\nreproachfully. “A little less talk, a little more action ... \\nLet me see you try. ...” \\n\\nTogether they raised their wands, concentrating with \\nall their might, and pointed them at their flasks. \\nHarry’s vinegar turned to ice; Ron’s flask exploded. \\n\\n“Yes ... for homework,” said Professor Flitwick, \\nreemerging from under the table and pulling shards \\nof glass out of the top of his hat, “practice.” \\n\\nThey had one of their rare joint free periods after \\nCharms and walked back to the common room \\ntogether. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted \\nabout the end of his relationship with Lavender, and \\nHermione seemed cheery too, though when asked \\nwhat she was grinning about she simply said, “It’s a \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 578 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnice day.” Neither of them seemed to have noticed \\nthat a fierce battle was raging inside Harry’s brain: \\n\\nShe’s Ron’s sister. \\n\\nBut she’s ditched Dean! \\n\\nShe’s still Ron’s sister. \\n\\nI’m his best mate! \\n\\nThat’ll make it worse. \\n\\nIf I talked to him first — \\n\\nHe’d hit you. \\n\\nWhat if I don’t care? \\n\\nHe’s your best mate\\\\ \\n\\nHarry barely noticed that they were climbing through \\nthe portrait hole into the sunny common room, and \\nonly vaguely registered the small group of seventh \\nyears clustered together there, until Hermione cried, \\n“Katie! You’re back! Are you okay?” \\n\\nHarry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking \\ncompletely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant \\nfriends. \\n\\n“I’m really well!” she said happily. “They let me out of \\nSt. Mungo’s on Monday, I had a couple of days at \\nhome with Mum and Dad and then came back here \\nthis morning. Leanne was just telling me about \\nMcLaggen and the last match, Harry. ...” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “well, now you’re back and Ron’s \\nfit, we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing \\n\\nPage | 579 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRavenclaw, which means we could still be in the \\nrunning for the Cup. Listen, Katie ...” \\n\\nHe had to put the question to her at once; his \\ncuriosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his \\nbrain. He dropped his voice as Katie’s friends started \\ngathering up their things; apparently they were late \\nfor Transfiguration. \\n\\n\"... that necklace ... can you remember who gave it to \\nyou now?” \\n\\n“No,” said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. \\n“Everyone’s been asking me, but I haven’t got a clue. \\nThe last thing I remember was walking into the ladies’ \\nin the Three Broomsticks.” \\n\\n“You definitely went into the bathroom, then?” said \\nHermione. \\n\\n“Well, I know I pushed open the door,” said Katie, “so \\nI suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just \\nbehind it. After that, my memory’s a blank until \\nabout two weeks ago in St. Mungo’s. Listen, I’d better \\ngo, I wouldn’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines \\neven if it is my first day back. ...” \\n\\nShe caught up her bag and books and hurried after \\nher friends, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit \\ndown at a window table and ponder what she had told \\nthem. \\n\\n“So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave \\nKatie the necklace,” said Hermione, “to be in the \\nladies’ bathroom.” \\n\\n“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said \\nHarry. “Don’t forget, there was a cauldron full of \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 580 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPolyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know some of it got \\nstolen. ...” \\n\\nIn his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes \\nand Goyles prance past, all transformed into girls. \\n\\n“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said \\nHarry, “and have a go at the Room of Requirement \\nagain.” \\n\\n“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said \\nHermione flatly, putting down the copy of Spellman’s \\nSyllabary she had just taken out of her bag. “Luck \\ncan only get you so far, Harry. The situation with \\nSlughorn was different; you always had the ability to \\npersuade him, you just needed to tweak the \\ncircumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you \\nthrough a powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go \\nwasting the rest of that potion! You’ll need all the luck \\nyou can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him \\n...” She dropped her voice to a whisper. \\n\\n“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, \\nignoring Hermione. “It’d be great to have a stock of it. \\n... Have a look in the book ...” \\n\\nHarry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out \\nof his bag and looked up Felix Felicis. \\n\\n“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running \\nan eye down the list of ingredients. “And it takes six \\nmonths ... You’ve got to let it stew. ...” \\n\\n“Typical,” said Ron. \\n\\nHarry was about to put his book away again when he \\nnoticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to \\nit, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned “For \\nEnemies,” that he had marked a few weeks \\n\\nPage | 581 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npreviously. He had still not found out what it did, \\nmainly because he did not want to test it around \\nHermione, but he was considering trying it out on \\nMcLaggen next time he came up behind him \\nunawares. \\n\\nThe only person who was not particularly pleased to \\nsee Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, \\nbecause he would no longer be required to fill her \\nplace as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough \\nwhen Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, \\nbut Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away \\nthat Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously \\nbehind his back. \\n\\nThe following fortnight saw the best Quidditch \\npractices Harry had known as Captain. His team was \\nso pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have \\nKatie back at last, that they were flying extremely \\nwell. \\n\\nGinny did not seem at all upset about the breakup \\nwith Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul \\nof the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing \\nup and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle \\nsped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at \\nMcLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them \\nall highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, \\nwas glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; \\nhe had received several more Bludger injuries during \\npractice because he had not been keeping his eyes on \\nthe Snitch. \\n\\nThe battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? \\nSometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron \\nmight not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but \\nthen he remembered Ron’s expression when he had \\nseen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 582 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nconsider it base treachery if Harry so much as held \\nher hand. ... \\n\\nYet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, \\nlaughing with her, walking back from practice with \\nher; however much his conscience ached, he found \\nhimself wondering how best to get her on her own. It \\nwould have been ideal if Slughorn had given another \\nof his little parties, for Ron would not be around — \\nbut unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given \\nthem up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for \\nHermione’s help, but he did not think he could stand \\nseeing the smug look on her face; he thought he \\ncaught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him \\nstaring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to \\ncomplicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if \\nhe didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny \\nout soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact \\nthat she was too popular for her own good. \\n\\nAll in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix \\nFelicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely \\nthis was a case for, as Hermione put it, “tweaking the \\ncircumstances”? The balmy days slid gently through \\nMay, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry’s shoulder \\nevery time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing \\nfor a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to \\nrealize that nothing would make him happier than his \\nbest friend and his sister falling for each other and to \\nleave them alone together for longer than a few \\nseconds. There seemed no chance of either while the \\nfinal Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron \\nwanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had \\nlittle thought for anything else. \\n\\nRon was not unique in this respect; interest in the \\nGryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely \\nhigh throughout the school, for the match would \\ndecide the Championship, which was still wide open. \\n\\nPage | 583 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three \\nhundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never \\nknown his team to fly better) then they would win the \\nChampionship. If they won by less than three \\nhundred points, they would come second to \\nRavenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they \\nwould be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by \\nmore than a hundred, they would be in fourth place \\nand nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him \\nforget that it had been he who had captained \\nGryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in \\ntwo centuries. \\n\\nThe run-up to this crucial match had all the usual \\nfeatures: members of rival Houses attempting to \\nintimidate opposing teams in the corridors; \\nunpleasant chants about individual players being \\nrehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members \\nthemselves either swaggering around enjoying all the \\nattention or else dashing into bathrooms between \\nclasses to throw up. Somehow, the game had become \\ninextricably linked in Harry’s mind with success or \\nfailure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help \\nfeeling that if they won by more than three hundred \\npoints, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after- \\nmatch party might be just as good as a hearty swig of \\nFelix Felicis. \\n\\nIn the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not \\nforgotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy \\nwas up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still \\nchecking the Marauder’s Map, and as he was unable \\nto locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still \\nspending plenty of time within the room. Although \\nHarry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in \\ngetting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted \\nit whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how \\nhe reworded his request, the wall remained firmly \\ndoorless. \\n\\nPage | 584 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA few days before the match against Ravenclaw, \\n\\nHarry found himself walking down to dinner alone \\nfrom the common room, Ron having rushed off into a \\nnearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and \\nHermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector \\nabout a mistake she thought she might have made in \\nher last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than \\nanything, Harry made his usual detour along the \\nseventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder’s Map \\nas he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy \\nanywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the \\nRoom of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy’s \\ntiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the \\nfloor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, \\nbut by Moaning Myrtle. \\n\\nHarry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling \\nwhen he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud \\ncrash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from \\nthe scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the \\nmarble staircase and along the passageway below. \\nOutside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the \\ndoor. He could not hear anything. He very quietly \\npushed the door open. \\n\\nDraco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, \\nhis hands clutching either side of the sink, his white- \\nblond head bowed. \\n\\n“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from one of \\nthe cubicles. “Don’t ... tell me what’s wrong ... I can \\nhelp you. ...” \\n\\n“No one can help me,” said Malfoy. His whole body \\nwas shaking. “I can’t do it. ... I can’t. ... It won’t work \\n... and unless I do it soon ... he says he’ll kill me. ...” \\n\\nAnd Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to \\nroot him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying — \\n\\nPage | 585 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nactually crying — tears streaming down his pale face \\ninto the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and \\nthen, with a great shudder, looked up into the \\ncracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his \\nshoulder. \\n\\nMalfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. \\nInstinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy’s hex \\nmissed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the \\nwall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, \\nthought Levicorpus\\\\ and flicked his wand, but Malfoy \\nblocked the jinx and raised his wand for another — \\n\\n“No! No! Stop it!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice \\nechoing loudly around the tiled room. “Stop! STOP!” \\n\\nThere was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry \\nexploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that \\nbackfired off the wall behind Malfoy’s ear and \\nsmashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who \\nscreamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry \\nslipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, “Cruci — ” \\n\\n“ SECTUMSEMPRAl” bellowed Harry from the floor, \\nwaving his wand wildly. \\n\\nBlood spurted from Malfoy’s face and chest as though \\nhe had been slashed with an invisible sword. He \\nstaggered backward and collapsed onto the \\nwaterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling \\nfrom his limp right hand. \\n\\n“No — ” gasped Harry. \\n\\nSlipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and \\nplunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining \\nscarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood- \\nsoaked chest. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 586 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No — I didn’t — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his \\nknees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably \\nin a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a \\ndeafening scream: “MURDER! MURDER IN THE \\nBATHROOM! MURDER!” \\n\\nThe door banged open behind Harry and he looked \\nup, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face \\nlivid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over \\nMalfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep \\nwounds Harry’s curse had made, muttering an \\nincantation that sounded almost like song. The flow \\nof blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue \\nfrom Malfoy’s face and repeated his spell. Now the \\nwounds seemed to be knitting. \\n\\nHarry was still watching, horrified by what he had \\ndone, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood \\nand water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and \\nwailing overhead. When Snape had performed his \\ncountercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy \\ninto a standing position. \\n\\n“You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain \\namount of scarring, but if you take dittany \\nimmediately we might avoid even that. ... Come. ...” \\n\\nHe supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at \\nthe door to say in a voice of cold fury, “And you, \\n\\nPotter ... You wait here for me.” \\n\\nIt did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He \\nstood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet \\nfloor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson \\nflowers across its surface. He could not even find it in \\nhimself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 587 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncontinued to wail and sob with increasingly evident \\nenjoyment. \\n\\n\\n\\nSnape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the \\nbathroom and closed the door behind him. \\n\\n“Go,” he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into \\nher toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind \\nher. \\n\\n“I didn’t mean it to happen,” said Harry at once. His \\nvoice echoed in the cold, watery space. “I didn’t know \\nwhat that spell did.” \\n\\nBut Snape ignored this. “Apparently I underestimated \\nyou, Potter,” he said quietly. “Who would have \\nthought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you \\nthat spell?” \\n\\n“I — read about it somewhere.” \\n\\n“Where?” \\n\\n“It was — a library book,” Harry invented wildly. “I \\ncan’t remember what it was call — ” \\n\\n“Liar,” said Snape. Harry’s throat went dry. He knew \\nwhat Snape was going to do and he had never been \\nable to prevent it. ... \\n\\nThe bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he \\nstruggled to block out all thought, but try as he \\nmight, the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced \\nPotion-Making swam hazily to the forefront of his \\nmind. \\n\\nAnd then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst \\nof this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 588 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnape’s black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape \\nhad not seen what he feared, but — \\n\\n“Bring me your schoolbag,” said Snape softly, “and all \\nof your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me \\nhere. Now!” \\n\\nThere was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and \\nsplashed out of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, \\nhe broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower. Most \\npeople were walking the other way; they gaped at him, \\ndrenched in water and blood, but he answered none \\nof the questions fired at him as he ran past. \\n\\nHe felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had \\nturned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been \\nthinking to copy such a spell into his book? And what \\nwould happen when Snape saw it? Would he tell \\nSlughorn — Harry’s stomach churned — how Harry \\nhad been achieving such good results in Potions all \\nyear? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that \\nhad taught Harry so much . . . the book that had \\nbecome a kind of guide and friend? Harry could not \\nlet it happen. ... He could not ... \\n\\n“Where Ve you — ? Why are you soaking — ? Is that \\nblood?” \\n\\nRon was standing at the top of the stairs, looking \\nbewildered at the sight of Harry. \\n\\n“I need your book,” Harry panted. “Your Potions book. \\nQuick ... give it to me ...” \\n\\n“But what about the Half-Blood — ” \\n\\n“I’ll explain later!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 589 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of \\nhis bag and handed it over; Harry sprinted off past \\nhim and back to the common room. Here, he seized \\nhis schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several \\npeople who had already finished their dinner, threw \\nhimself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off \\nalong the seventh-floor corridor. \\n\\nHe skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing \\ntrolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk. \\n\\nI need a place to hide my book. ... I need a place to \\nhide my book. ... I need a place to hide my book. . . . \\n\\nThree times he walked up and down in front of the \\nstretch of blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there \\nit was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. \\nHarry wrenched it open, flung himself inside, and \\nslammed it shut. \\n\\nHe gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of \\nwhat awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not \\nhelp but be overawed by what he was looking at. He \\nwas standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, \\nwhose high windows were sending shafts of light \\ndown upon what looked like a city with towering \\nwalls, built of what Harry knew must be objects \\nhidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There \\nwere alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles \\nof broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, \\nperhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or \\nelse hidden by castle-proud house-elves. There were \\nthousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned \\nor graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults \\nand Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in \\nthem to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of \\nother forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of \\ncongealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were \\nwhat looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles \\nPage | 590 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting \\nswords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe. \\n\\nHarry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways \\nbetween all this hidden treasure. He turned right past \\nan enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a \\nleft at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which \\nMontague had got lost the previous year, finally \\npausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have \\nhad acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened \\none of the cupboard’s creaking doors: It had already \\nbeen used as a hiding place for something in a cage \\nthat had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He \\nstuffed the Half-Blood Prince’s book behind the cage \\nand slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his \\nheart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the \\nclutter. ... Would he be able to find this spot again \\namidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an \\nugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he \\nstood it on top of the cupboard where the book was \\nnow hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished \\ntiara on the statue’s head to make it more distinctive, \\nthen sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden \\njunk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back \\nout onto the corridor, where he slammed the door \\nbehind him, and it turned at once back into stone. \\n\\nHarry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor \\nbelow, cramming Ron’s copy of Advanced Potion- \\nMaking into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he \\nwas back in front of Snape, who held out his hand \\nwordlessly for Harry’s schoolbag. Harry handed it \\nover, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited. \\n\\nOne by one, Snape extracted Harry’s books and \\nexamined them. Finally, the only book left was the \\nPotions book, which he looked at very carefully before \\nspeaking. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 591 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, \\nPotter?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, still breathing hard. \\n\\n“You’re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, with a touch more defiance. \\n\\n“This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you \\npurchased from Flourish and Blotts?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry firmly. \\n\\n“Then why,” asked Snape, “does it have the name \\n‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover?” \\n\\nHarry’s heart missed a beat. “That’s my nickname,” \\nhe said. \\n\\n“Your nickname,” repeated Snape. \\n\\n“Yeah ... that’s what my friends call me,” said Harry. \\n\\n“I understand what a nickname is,” said Snape. The \\ncold, black eyes were boring once more into Harry’s; \\nhe tried not to look into them. Close your mind. ... \\nClose your mind. . . . But he had never learned how to \\ndo it properly. . . . \\n\\n“Do you know what I think, Potter?” said Snape, very \\nquietly. “I think that you are a liar and a cheat and \\nthat you deserve detention with me every Saturday \\nuntil the end of term. What do you think, Potter?” \\n\\n“I — I don’t agree, sir,” said Harry, still refusing to \\nlook into Snape ’s eyes. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 592 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, we shall see how you feel after your \\ndetentions,” said Snape. “Ten o’clock Saturday \\nmorning, Potter. My office.” \\n\\n“But sir ...” said Harry, looking up desperately. \\n“Quidditch ... the last match of the ...” \\n\\n“Ten o’clock,” whispered Snape, with a smile that \\nshowed his yellow teeth. “Poor Gryffindor ... fourth \\nplace this year, I fear ...” \\n\\nAnd he left the bathroom without another word, \\nleaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling \\nsicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life. \\n\\n“I won’t say ‘I told you so,’ ” said Hermione, an hour \\nlater in the common room. \\n\\n“Leave it, Hermione,” said Ron angrily. \\n\\nHarry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite \\nat all. He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione, and \\nGinny what had happened, not that there seemed to \\nhave been much need. The news had traveled very \\nfast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon \\nherself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to \\ntell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the \\nhospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no \\ntime in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had \\ntold the staff precisely what had happened. Harry had \\nalready been called out of the common room to \\nendure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the \\ncompany of Professor McGonagall, who had told him \\nhe was lucky not to have been expelled and that she \\nsupported wholeheartedly Snape ’s punishment of \\ndetention every Saturday until the end of term. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 593 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I told you there was something wrong with that \\nPrince person,” Hermione said, evidently unable to \\nstop herself. “And I was right, wasn’t I?” \\n\\n“No, I don’t think you were,” said Harry stubbornly. \\n\\nHe was having a bad enough time without Hermione \\nlecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor team’s \\nfaces when he had told them he would not be able to \\nplay on Saturday had been the worst punishment of \\nall. He could feel Ginny’s eyes on him now but did not \\nmeet them; he did not want to see disappointment or \\nanger there. He had just told her that she would be \\nplaying Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be \\nrejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if \\nthey won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the \\npost-match euphoria. ... The thought went through \\nHarry like an icy knife. ... \\n\\n“Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up \\nfor that book when that spell — ” \\n\\n“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped \\nHarry. “The Prince only copied it out! It’s not like he \\nwas advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he \\nwas making a note of something that had been used \\nagainst him!” \\n\\n“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually \\ndefending — ” \\n\\n“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I \\nwish I hadn’t done it, and not just because I’ve got \\nabout a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn’t’ve \\nused a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you \\ncan’t blame the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, \\nit’s really good’ — he was just making notes for \\nhimself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 594 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re \\ngoing to go back — ?” \\n\\n“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. \\n“Listen, without the Prince I’d never have won the \\nFelix Felicis. I’d never have known how to save Ron \\nfrom poisoning, I’d never have — ” \\n\\n“ — got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t \\ndeserve,” said Hermione nastily. \\n\\n“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was \\nso amazed, so grateful, he looked up. “By the sound \\nof it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, \\nyou should be glad Harry had something good up his \\nsleeve!” \\n\\n“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said \\nHermione, clearly stung. “But you can’t call that \\nSectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where it’s \\nlanded him! And I’d have thought, seeing what this \\nhas done to your chances in the match — ” \\n\\n“Oh, don’t start acting as though you understand \\nQuidditch,” snapped Ginny, “you’ll only embarrass \\nyourself.” \\n\\nHarry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had \\nalways got on together very well, were now sitting \\nwith their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. \\nRon looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a \\nbook at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, \\nlittle though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably \\ncheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them \\nspoke again for the rest of the evening. \\n\\nHis lightheartedness was short-lived. There were \\nSlytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to \\nmention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who \\n\\nPage | 595 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwere most unhappy that their Captain had got \\nhimself banned from the final match of the season. By \\nSaturday morning, whatever he might have told \\nHermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the \\nFelix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the \\nQuidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. It \\nwas almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of \\nstudents streaming out into the sunshine, all of them \\nwearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners \\nand scarves, to descend the stone steps into the \\ndungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the \\ncrowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would \\nnot be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer \\nor groan. \\n\\n“Ah, Potter,” said Snape, when Harry had knocked on \\nhis door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office \\nthat Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had \\nnot vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same \\nslimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions \\nall around the walls. Ominously, there were many \\ncobwebbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was \\nclearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, \\nhard, and pointless work about them. \\n\\n“Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out \\nthese old files,” said Snape softly. “They are the \\nrecords of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their \\npunishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the \\ncards have suffered damage from mice, we would like \\nyou to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh \\nand, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, \\nreplace them in the boxes. You will not use magic.” \\n\\n“Right, Professor,” said Harry, with as much contempt \\nas he could put into the last three syllables. \\n\\n“I thought you could start,” said Snape, a malicious \\nsmile on his lips, “with boxes one thousand and \\n\\nPage | 596 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find \\nsome familiar names in there, which should add \\ninterest to the task. Here, you see ...” \\n\\nHe pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes \\nwith a flourish and read, “ ‘James Potter and Sirius \\nBlack. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram \\nAubrey. Aubrey’s head twice normal size. Double \\ndetention.’ ” Snape sneered. “It must be such a \\ncomfort to think that, though they are gone, a record \\nof their great achievements remains. ...” \\n\\nHarry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of \\nhis stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself \\nretaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and \\npulled one toward him. \\n\\nIt was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring \\nwork, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with \\nthe regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just \\nread his father or Sirius’s names, usually coupled \\ntogether in various petty misdeeds, occasionally \\naccompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter \\nPettigrew. And while he copied out all their various \\noffenses and punishments, he wondered what was \\ngoing on outside, where the match would have just \\nstarted . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . . \\n\\nHarry glanced again and again at the large clock \\nticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as \\nfast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched \\nit to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for \\nonly half an hour ... an hour ... an hour and a half. . . . \\n\\nHarry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock \\nshowed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken \\nat all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at \\nten past one. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 597 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think that will do,” he said coldly. “Mark the place \\nyou have reached. You will continue at ten o’clock \\nnext Saturday.” \\n\\n“Yes, sir.” \\n\\nHarry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and \\nhurried out of the door before Snape could change his \\nmind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his \\nears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. \\n...It was over, then. ... \\n\\nHe hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran \\nup the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won \\nor lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated \\nin their own common room. \\n\\n“ Quid agis?” he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, \\nwondering what he would find inside. \\n\\nHer expression was unreadable as she replied, “You’ll \\nsee.” \\n\\nAnd she swung forward. \\n\\nA roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind \\nher. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the \\nsight of him; several hands pulled him into the room. \\n\\n“We won!” yelled Ron, bounding into sight and \\nbrandishing the silver Cup at Harry. “We won! Four \\nhundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!” \\n\\nHarry looked around; there was Ginny running \\ntoward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face \\nas she threw her arms around him. And without \\nthinking, without planning it, without worrying about \\nthe fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed \\nher. \\n\\nPage | 598 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter several long moments — or it might have been \\nhalf an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they \\nbroke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then \\nseveral people wolf-whistled and there was an \\noutbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the \\ntop of Ginny’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a \\nshattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane \\nlooking as though she might throw something. \\nHermione was beaming, but Harry’s eyes sought Ron. \\nAt last he found him, still clutching the Cup and \\nwearing an expression appropriate to having been \\nclubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they \\nlooked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the \\nhead that Harry understood to mean, Well — if you \\nmust. \\n\\nThe creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he \\ngrinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of \\nthe portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed \\nindicated, during which — if they had time — they \\nmight discuss the match. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 599 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SEER OVERHEARD \\n\\nThe fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny \\nWeasley seemed to interest a great number of people, \\nmost of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and \\nhappily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. \\nAfter all, it made a very nice change to be talked \\nabout because of something that was making him \\nhappier than he could remember being for a very long \\ntime, rather than because he had been involved in \\nhorrific scenes of Dark Magic. \\n\\n“You’d think people had better things to gossip \\nabout,” said Ginny, as she sat on the common room \\nfloor, leaning against Harry’s legs and reading the \\nDaily Prophet “Three dementor attacks in a week, and \\nall Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got \\na hippogriff tattooed across your chest.” \\n\\nRon and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry \\nignored them. \\n\\n“What did you tell her?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 600 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“I told her it’s a Hungarian Horntail,” said Ginny, \\nturning a page of the newspaper idly. “Much more \\nmacho.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning. “And what did you tell \\nher Ron’s got?” \\n\\n“A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.” \\n\\nRon scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing. \\n\\n“Watch it,” he said, pointing warningly at Harry and \\nGinny. “Just because I’ve given my permission doesn’t \\nmean I can’t withdraw it — ” \\n\\n“ ‘Your permission,’ ” scoffed Ginny. “Since when did \\nyou give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you \\nsaid yourself you’d rather it was Harry than Michael \\nor Dean.” \\n\\n“Yeah, I would,” said Ron grudgingly. “And just as \\nlong as you don’t start snogging each other in public \\n\\n\\n\\n“You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, \\nthrashing around like a pair of eels all over the \\nplace?” demanded Ginny. \\n\\nBut Ron’s tolerance was not to be tested much as \\nthey moved into June, for Harry and Ginny’s time \\ntogether was becoming increasingly restricted. \\n\\nGinny’s O.W.L.s were approaching and she was \\ntherefore forced to study for hours into the night. On \\none such evening, when Ginny had retired to the \\nlibrary, and Harry was sitting beside the window in \\nthe common room, supposedly finishing his \\nHerbology homework but in reality reliving a \\nparticularly happy hour he had spent down by the \\nlake with Ginny at lunchtime, Hermione dropped into \\nPage | 601 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly \\npurposeful look on her face. \\n\\n“I want to talk to you, Harry.” \\n\\n“What about?” said Harry suspiciously. Only the \\nprevious day, Hermione had told him off for \\ndistracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard \\nfor her examinations. \\n\\n“The so-called Half-Blood Prince.” \\n\\n“Oh, not again,” he groaned. “Will you please drop it?” \\n\\nHe had not dared to return to the Room of \\nRequirement to retrieve his book, and his \\nperformance in Potions was suffering accordingly \\n(though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had \\njocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But \\nHarry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope \\nof laying hands on the Prince’s book, and was \\ndetermined to leave it where it was while Snape \\nremained on the lookout. \\n\\n“I’m not dropping it,” said Hermione firmly, “until \\nyou’ve heard me out. Now, I’ve been trying to find out \\na bit about who might make a hobby of inventing \\nDark spells — ” \\n\\n“He didn’t make a hobby of it — ” \\n\\n“He, he — who says it’s a he?” \\n\\n“We’ve been through this,” said Harry crossly. “Prince, \\nHermione, PrinceV’ \\n\\n“Right!” said Hermione, red patches blazing in her \\ncheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 602 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof her pocket and slammed it down on the table in \\nfront of Harry. “Look at that! Look at the picture!” \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and \\nstared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; \\nRon leaned over for a look too. The picture showed a \\nskinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she \\nlooked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy \\nbrows and a long, pallid face. Underneath the \\nphotograph was the caption: EILEEN PRINCE, \\nCAPTAIN OF THE HOGWARTS GOBSTONES TEAM. \\n\\n“So?” said Harry, scanning the short news item to \\nwhich the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story \\nabout interschool competitions. \\n\\n“Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.” \\n\\nThey looked at each other, and Harry realized what \\nHermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing. \\n\\n“No way.” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“You think she was the Half-Blood ... ? Oh, come on.” \\n\\n“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in \\nthe Wizarding world! It’s either a nickname, a made- \\nup title somebody’s given themselves, or it could be \\ntheir actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her \\nfather was a wizard whose surname was Prince, and \\nher mother was a Muggle, then that would make her \\na “half-blood Prince’!” \\n\\n“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione ...” \\n\\n“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a \\nPrince!” \\n\\nPage | 603 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just \\ntell.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have \\nbeen clever enough,” said Hermione angrily. \\n\\n“How can I have hung round with you for five years \\nand not think girls are clever?” said Harry, stung by \\nthis. “It’s the way he writes, I just know the Prince \\nwas a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got anything to \\ndo with it. Where did you get this anyway?” \\n\\n“The library,” said Hermione predictably. “There’s a \\nwhole collection of old Prophets up there. Well, I’m \\ngoing to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.” \\n\\n“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably. \\n\\n“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” \\nshe shot at him, as she reached the portrait hole, “is \\nrecords of old Potions awards!” \\n\\nHarry scowled after her for a moment, then continued \\nhis contemplation of the darkening sky. \\n\\n“She’s just never got over you outperforming her in \\nPotions,” said Ron, returning to his copy of A \\nThousand Magical Herbs and Fungi. \\n\\n“You don’t think I’m mad, wanting that book back, do \\nyou?” \\n\\n“ ’Course not,” said Ron robustly. “He was a genius, \\nthe Prince. Anyway ... without his bezoar tip ...” He \\ndrew his finger significantly across his own throat. “I \\nwouldn’t be here to discuss it, would I? I mean, I’m \\nnot saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great — ” \\n\\n“Nor am I,” said Harry quickly. \\n\\nPage | 604 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But he healed all right, didn’t he? Back on his feet in \\nno time.” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Harry; this was perfectly true, although \\nhis conscience squirmed slightly all the same. \\n\\n“Thanks to Snape ...” \\n\\n“You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?” \\nRon continued. \\n\\n“Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday \\nafter that,” sighed Harry. “And he’s hinting now that if \\nI don’t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we’ll \\ncarry on next year.” \\n\\nHe was finding these detentions particularly irksome \\nbecause they cut into the already limited time he \\ncould have been spending with Ginny. Indeed, he had \\nfrequently wondered lately whether Snape did not \\nknow this, for he was keeping Harry later and later \\nevery time, while making pointed asides about Harry \\nhaving to miss the good weather and the varied \\nopportunities it offered. \\n\\nHarry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the \\nappearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was \\nholding out a scroll of parchment. \\n\\n“Thanks, Jimmy ... Hey, it’s from Dumbledore!” said \\nHarry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and \\nscanning it. “He wants me to go to his office as quick \\nas I can!” \\n\\nThey stared at each other. \\n\\n“Blimey,” whispered Ron. “You don’t reckon ... he \\nhasn’t found ... ?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 605 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Better go and see, hadn’t I?” said Harry, jumping to \\nhis feet. \\n\\nHe hurried out of the common room and along the \\nseventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but \\nPeeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, \\nthrowing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of \\nway and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry’s \\ndefensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was \\nsilence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left \\nuntil curfew, most people had already returned to \\ntheir common rooms. \\n\\nAnd then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He \\nstopped in his tracks, listening. \\n\\n“How — dare — you — aaaaargh!” \\n\\nThe noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry \\nsprinted toward it, his wand at the ready, hurtled \\naround another corner, and saw Professor Trelawney \\nsprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of \\nher many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside \\nher, one broken. \\n\\n“Professor — ” \\n\\nHarry hurried forward and helped Professor \\nTrelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads \\nhad become entangled with her glasses. She hiccuped \\nloudly, patted her hair, and pulled herself up on \\nHarry’s helping arm. \\n\\n“What happened, Professor?” \\n\\n“You may well ask!” she said shrilly. “I was strolling \\nalong, brooding upon certain dark portents I happen \\nto have glimpsed ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 606 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Harry was not paying much attention. He had \\njust noticed where they were standing: There on the \\nright was the tapestry of dancing trolls, and on the \\nleft, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall \\nthat concealed — \\n\\n“Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of \\nRequirement?” \\n\\n\"... omens I have been vouchsafed — what?” She \\nlooked suddenly shifty. \\n\\n“The Room of Requirement,” repeated Harry. “Were \\nyou trying to get in there?” \\n\\n“I — well — I didn’t know students knew about — ” \\n\\n“Not all of them do,” said Harry. “But what happened? \\nYou screamed. ... It sounded as though you were \\nhurt. ...” \\n\\n“I — well,” said Professor Trelawney, drawing her \\nshawls around her defensively and staring down at \\nhim with her vastly magnified eyes. “I wished to — ah \\n— deposit certain — um — personal items in the \\nroom. ...” And she muttered something about “nasty \\naccusations.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry, glancing down at the sherry \\nbottles. “But you couldn’t get in and hide them?” \\n\\nHe found this very odd; the room had opened for him, \\nafter all, when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood \\nPrince’s book. \\n\\n“Oh, I got in all right,” said Professor Trelawney, \\nglaring at the wall. “But there was somebody already \\nin there.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 607 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Somebody in — ? Who?” demanded Harry. “Who was \\nin there?” \\n\\n“I have no idea,” said Professor Trelawney, looking \\nslightly taken aback at the urgency in Harry’s voice. “I \\nwalked into the room and I heard a voice, which has \\nnever happened before in all my years of hiding — of \\nusing the room, I mean.” \\n\\n“A voice? Saying what?” \\n\\n“I don’t know that it was saying anything,” said \\nProfessor Trelawney. “It was ... whooping.” \\n\\n“ Whooping?” \\n\\n“Gleefully,” she said, nodding. \\n\\nHarry stared at her. \\n\\n“Was it male or female?” \\n\\n“I would hazard a guess at male,” said Professor \\nTrelawney. \\n\\n“And it sounded happy?” \\n\\n“Very happy,” said Professor Trelawney sniffily. \\n\\n“As though it was celebrating?” \\n\\n“Most definitely.” \\n\\n“And then — ?” \\n\\n“And then I called out Who’s there?’ ” \\n\\n“You couldn’t have found out who it was without \\nasking?” Harry asked her, slightly frustrated. \\n\\nPage | 608 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Inner Eye,” said Professor Trelawney with \\ndignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of \\nglittering beads, “was fixed upon matters well outside \\nthe mundane realms of whooping voices.” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry hastily; he had heard about \\nProfessor Trelawney’s Inner Eye all too often before. \\n“And did the voice say who was there?” \\n\\n“No, it did not,” she said. “Everything went pitch- \\nblack and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled \\nheadfirst out of the room!” \\n\\n“And you didn’t see that coming?” said Harry, unable \\nto help himself. \\n\\n“No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch — ” She stopped \\nand glared at him suspiciously. \\n\\n“I think you’d better tell Professor Dumbledore,” said \\nHarry. “He ought to know Malfoy’s celebrating — I \\nmean, that someone threw you out of the room.” \\n\\nTo his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up \\nat this suggestion, looking haughty. \\n\\n“The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer \\nfewer visits from me,” she said coldly. “I am not one to \\npress my company upon those who do not value it. If \\nDumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards \\nshow — ” Her bony hand closed suddenly around \\nHarry’s wrist. “Again and again, no matter how I lay \\nthem out — ” And she pulled a card dramatically from \\nunderneath her shawls. “ — the lightning-struck \\ntower,” she whispered. “Calamity. Disaster. Coming \\nnearer all the time ...” \\n\\n“Right,” said Harry again. “Well ... I still think you \\nshould tell Dumbledore about this voice, and \\n\\nPage | 609 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\neverything going dark and being thrown out of the \\nroom. ...” \\n\\n“You think so?” Professor Trelawney seemed to \\nconsider the matter for a moment, but Harry could \\ntell that she liked the idea of retelling her little \\nadventure. \\n\\n“I’m going to see him right now,” said Harry. “I’ve got \\na meeting with him. We could go together.” \\n\\n“Oh, well, in that case,” said Professor Trelawney with \\na smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry \\nbottles, and dumped them unceremoniously in a large \\nblue-and-white vase standing in a nearby niche. \\n\\n“I miss having you in my classes, Harry,” she said \\nsoulfully as they set off together. “You were never \\nmuch of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object \\nof Professor Trelawney’s continual predictions of \\ndoom. \\n\\n“I am afraid,” she went on, “that the nag — I’m sorry, \\nthe centaur — knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked \\nhim — one Seer to another — had he not, too, sensed \\nthe distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he \\nseemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!” \\n\\nHer voice rose rather hysterically, and Harry caught a \\npowerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had \\nbeen left behind. \\n\\n“Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have \\nnot inherited my great-great-grandmother’s gift. \\n\\nThose rumors have been bandied about by the jealous \\nfor years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? \\n\\nPage | 610 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWould Dumbledore have let me teach at this great \\nschool, put so much trust in me all these years, had I \\nnot proved myself to him?” \\n\\nHarry mumbled something indistinct. \\n\\n“I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,” \\nwent on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. “He \\nwas deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed. ... \\nI was staying at the Hog’s Head, which I do not \\nadvise, incidentally — bedbugs, dear boy — but funds \\nwere low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling \\nupon me in my room. He questioned me. ... I must \\nconfess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed \\ntoward Divination . . . and I remember I was starting to \\nfeel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day ... but \\nthen ...” \\n\\nAnd now Harry was paying attention properly for the \\nfirst time, for he knew what had happened then: \\nProfessor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had \\naltered the course of his whole life, the prophecy \\nabout him and Voldemort. \\n\\n\"... but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus \\nSnape!” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it \\nflew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman \\nstanding with Snape, who was waffling about having \\ncome the wrong way up the stairs, although I’m afraid \\nthat I myself rather thought he had been \\napprehended eavesdropping on my interview with \\nDumbledore — you see, he himself was seeking a job \\nat the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, \\nafter that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more \\ndisposed to give me a job, and I could not help \\nPage | 611 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated \\nthe stark contrast between my own unassuming \\nmanners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, \\nthrusting young man who was prepared to listen at \\nkeyholes — Harry, dear?” \\n\\nShe looked back over her shoulder, having only just \\nrealized that Harry was no longer with her; he had \\nstopped walking and they were now ten feet from each \\nother. \\n\\n“Harry?” she repeated uncertainly. \\n\\nPerhaps his face was white to make her look so \\nconcerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock- \\nstill as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after \\nwave, obliterating everything except the information \\nthat had been kept from him for so long. . . . \\n\\nIt was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was \\nSnape who had carried the news of the prophecy to \\nVoldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had \\nsent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and \\ntheir son. ... \\n\\nNothing else mattered to Harry just now. \\n\\n“Harry?” said Professor Trelawney again. “Harry — I \\nthought we were going to see the headmaster \\ntogether?” \\n\\n“You stay here,” said Harry through numb lips. \\n\\n“But dear ... I was going to tell him how I was \\nassaulted in the Room of — ” \\n\\n“You stay here!” Harry repeated angrily. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 612 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked alarmed as he ran past her, around the \\ncorner into Dumbledore’s corridor, where the lone \\ngargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at \\nthe gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase \\nthree steps at a time. He did not knock upon \\nDumbledore’s door, he hammered; and the calm voice \\nanswered, “Enter” after Harry had already flung \\nhimself into the room. \\n\\nFawkes the phoenix looked around, his bright black \\neyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset \\nbeyond the windows. Dumbledore was standing at the \\nwindow looking out at the grounds, a long, black \\ntraveling cloak in his arms. \\n\\n“Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with \\nme.” \\n\\nFor a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the \\nconversation with Trelawney had driven everything \\nelse out of his head and his brain seemed to be \\nmoving very slowly. \\n\\n“Come . . . with you ... ?” \\n\\n“Only if you wish it, of course.” \\n\\n“If I ...” \\n\\nAnd then Harry remembered why he had been eager \\nto come to Dumbledore’s office in the first place. \\n“You’ve found one? You’ve found a Horcrux?” \\n\\n“I believe so.” \\n\\nRage and resentment fought shock and excitement: \\nFor several moments, Harry could not speak. \\n\\n“It is natural to be afraid,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\nPage | 613 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Tm not scared!” said Harry at once, and it was \\nperfectly true; fear was one emotion he was not \\nfeeling at all. “Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?” \\n\\n“I am not sure which it is — though I think we can \\nrule out the snake — but I believe it to be hidden in a \\ncave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have \\nbeen trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in \\nwhich Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from \\nhis orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “How is it protected?” \\n\\n“I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely \\nwrong.” Dumbledore hesitated, then said, “Harry, I \\npromised you that you could come with me, and I \\nstand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of \\nme not to warn you that this will be exceedingly \\ndangerous.” \\n\\n“I’m coming,” said Harry, almost before Dumbledore \\nhad finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, \\nhis desire to do something desperate and risky had \\nincreased tenfold in the last few minutes. This \\nseemed to show on Harry’s face, for Dumbledore \\nmoved away from the window and looked more closely \\nat Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows. \\n\\n“What has happened to you?” \\n\\n“Nothing,” lied Harry promptly. \\n\\n“What has upset you?” \\n\\n“I’m not upset.” \\n\\n“Harry, you were never a good Occlumens — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nThe word was the spark that ignited Harry’s fury. \\n\\nPage | 614 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Snape!” he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft \\nsquawk behind them. “Snape’s what’s happened! He \\ntold Voldemort about the prophecy, it was him, he \\nlistened outside the door, Trelawney told me!” \\n\\nDumbledore’s expression did not change, but Harry \\nthought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast \\nby the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore \\nsaid nothing. “When did you find out about this?” he \\nasked at last. \\n\\n“Just now!” said Harry, who was refraining from \\nyelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, \\nhe could not stop himself. “AND YOU LET HIM \\nTEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO \\nAFTER MY MUM AND DAD!” \\n\\nBreathing hard as though he was fighting, Harry \\nturned away from Dumbledore, who still had not \\nmoved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, \\nrubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising \\nevery last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking \\nthings over. He wanted to rage and storm at \\nDumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try \\nand destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that \\nhe was a foolish old man for trusting Snape, but he \\nwas terrified that Dumbledore would not take him \\nalong unless he mastered his anger. ... \\n\\n“Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Please listen to \\nme.” \\n\\nIt was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to \\nrefrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, \\nand looked into Dumbledore’s lined face. \\n\\n“Professor Snape made a terrible — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 615 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening \\nat the door!” \\n\\n“Please let me finish.” Dumbledore waited until Harry \\nhad nodded curtly, then went on. “Professor Snape \\nmade a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord \\nVoldemort’s employ on the night he heard the first \\nhalf of Professor Trelawney’s prophecy. Naturally, he \\nhastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it \\nconcerned his master most deeply. But he did not \\nknow — he had no possible way of knowing — which \\nboy Voldemort would hunt from then onward, or that \\nthe parents he would destroy in his murderous quest \\nwere people that Professor Snape knew, that they \\nwere your mother and father — ” \\n\\nHarry let out a yell of mirthless laughter. \\n\\n“He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven’t you \\nnoticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend \\nto end up dead?” \\n\\n“You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt \\nwhen he realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted \\nthe prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be the greatest \\nregret of his life and the reason that he returned — ” \\n\\n“But he’s a very good Occlumens, isn’t he, sir?” said \\nHarry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of \\nkeeping it steady. “And isn’t Voldemort convinced that \\nSnape’s on his side, even now? Professor ... how can \\nyou be sure Snape’s on our side?” \\n\\nDumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as \\nthough he was trying to make up his mind about \\nsomething. At last he said, “I am sure. I trust Severus \\nSnape completely.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 616 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort \\nto steady himself. It did not work. \\n\\n“Well, I don’t!” he said, as loudly as before. “He’s up to \\nsomething with Draco Malfoy right now, right under \\nyour nose, and you still — ” \\n\\n“We have discussed this, Harry,” said Dumbledore, \\nand now he sounded stern again. “I have told you my \\nviews.” \\n\\n“You’re leaving the school tonight, and I’ll bet you \\nhaven’t even considered that Snape and Malfoy might \\ndecide to — ” \\n\\n“To what?” asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. \\n“What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?” \\n\\n“I ... they’re up to something!” said Harry, and his \\nhands curled into fists as he said it. “Professor \\nTrelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, \\ntrying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard \\nMalfoy whooping, celebrating! He’s trying to mend \\nsomething dangerous in there and if you ask me, he’s \\nfixed it at last and you’re about to just walk out of \\nschool without — ” \\n\\n“Enough,” said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, \\nand yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had \\nfinally crossed some invisible line. “Do you think that \\nI have once left the school unprotected during my \\nabsences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, \\nthere will again be additional protection in place. \\nPlease do not suggest that I do not take the safety of \\nmy students seriously, Harry.” \\n\\n“I didn’t — ” mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but \\nDumbledore cut across him. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 617 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.” \\n\\nHarry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too \\nfar, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying \\nDumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, “Do you wish \\nto come with me tonight?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry at once. \\n\\n“Very well, then: Listen.” Dumbledore drew himself up \\nto his full height. “I take you with me on one \\ncondition: that you obey any command I might give \\nyou at once, and without question.” \\n\\n“Of course.” \\n\\n“Be sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you \\nmust follow even such orders as ‘run,’ ‘hide,’ or ‘go \\nback.’ Do I have your word?” \\n\\n“I — yes, of course.” \\n\\n“If I tell you to hide, you will do so?” \\n\\n“Yes.” \\n\\n“If I tell you to flee, you will obey?” \\n\\n“Yes.” \\n\\n“If I tell you to leave me and save yourself, you will do \\nas I tell you? \\n\\n\\n\\n“Harry?” \\n\\nThey looked at each other for a moment. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 618 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your \\nInvisibility Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in \\nfive minutes’ time.” \\n\\nDumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery \\nwindow; the sun was now a ruby red glare along the \\nhorizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and \\ndown the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear \\nall of a sudden. He knew what to do. \\n\\nRon and Hermione were sitting together in the \\ncommon room when he came back. “What does he \\nwant?” Hermione said at once. “Harry, are you okay?” \\nshe added anxiously. \\n\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry shortly, racing past them. He \\ndashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he \\nflung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder’s \\nMap and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back \\ndown the stairs and into the common room, skidding \\nto a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking \\nstunned. \\n\\n“I’ve got to be quick,” Harry panted. “Dumbledore \\nthinks I’m getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen. ...” \\n\\nQuickly he told them where he was going and why. He \\ndid not pause either for Hermione ’s gasps of horror or \\nfor Ron’s hasty questions; they could work out the \\nfiner details for themselves later. \\n\\n“... so you see what this means?” Harry finished at a \\ngallop. “Dumbledore won’t be here tonight, so \\nMalfoy’s going to have another clear shot at whatever \\nhe’s up to. No, listen to me!” he hissed angrily, as both \\nRon and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. \\n“I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of \\nPage | 619 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRequirement. Here — ” He shoved the Marauder’s Map \\ninto Hermione’s hands. “You’ve got to watch him and \\nyou’ve got to watch Snape too. Use anyone else who \\nyou can rustle up from the D.A., Hermione, those \\ncontact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore \\nsays he’s put extra protection in the school, but if \\nSnape ’s involved, he’ll know what Dumbledore ’s \\nprotection is, and how to avoid it — but he won’t be \\nexpecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?” \\n\\n“Harry — ” began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear. \\n\\n“I haven’t got time to argue,” said Harry curtly. “Take \\nthis as well — ” \\n\\nHe thrust the socks into Ron’s hands. \\n\\n“Thanks,” said Ron. “Er — why do I need socks?” \\n\\n“You need what’s wrapped in them, it’s the Felix \\nFelicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. \\nSay good-bye to her for me. I’d better go, \\n\\nDumbledore ’s waiting — ” \\n\\n“No!” said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little \\nbottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. “We don’t \\nwant it, you take it, who knows what you’re going to \\nbe facing?” \\n\\n“I’ll be fine, I’ll be with Dumbledore,” said Harry. “I \\nwant to know you lot are okay. ... Don’t look like that, \\nHermione, I’ll see you later. ...” \\n\\nAnd he was off, hurrying back through the portrait \\nhole and toward the entrance hall. \\n\\nDumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front \\ndoors. He turned as Harry came skidding out onto the \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 620 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntopmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in \\nhis side. \\n\\n“I would like you to wear your cloak, please,” said \\nDumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it \\non before saying, “Very good. Shall we go?” \\n\\nDumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his \\nown traveling cloak barely stirring in the still summer \\nair. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility \\nCloak, still panting and sweating rather a lot. \\n\\n“But what will people think when they see you \\nleaving, Professor?” Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy \\nand Snape. \\n\\n“That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,” said \\nDumbledore lightly. “I sometimes offer Rosmerta my \\ncustom, or else visit the Hog’s Head ... or I appear to. \\nIt is as good a way as any of disguising one’s true \\ndestination.” \\n\\nThey made their way down the drive in the gathering \\ntwilight. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, \\nlake water, and wood smoke from Hagrid’s cabin. It \\nwas difficult to believe that they were heading for \\nanything dangerous or frightening. \\n\\n“Professor,” said Harry quietly, as the gates at the \\nbottom of the drive came into view, “will we be \\nApparating?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “You can Apparate now, I \\nbelieve?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I haven’t got a license.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 621 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled \\neverything by turning up a hundred miles from where \\nhe was supposed to go? \\n\\n“No matter,” said Dumbledore, “I can assist you \\nagain.” \\n\\nThey turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted \\nlane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they \\nwalked, and by the time they reached the High Street \\nnight was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from \\nwindows over shops and as they neared the Three \\nBroomsticks they heard raucous shouting. \\n\\n“ — and stay out!” shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly \\nejecting a grubby-looking wizard. “Oh, hello, Albus ... \\nYou’re out late ...” \\n\\n“Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening ... forgive me, \\nI’m off to the Hog’s Head. ... No offense, but I feel like \\na quieter atmosphere tonight. ...” \\n\\nA minute later they turned the corner into the side \\nstreet where the Hog’s Head’s sign creaked a little, \\nthough there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three \\nBroomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely \\nempty. \\n\\n“It will not be necessary for us to enter,” muttered \\nDumbledore, glancing around. “As long as nobody \\nsees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm, \\nHarry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely \\nguiding you. On the count of three ... One ... two ... \\nthree ...” \\n\\nHarry turned. At once, there was that horrible \\nsensation that he was being squeezed through a thick \\nrubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of \\nhim was being compressed almost past endurance \\n\\nPage | 622 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand then, just when he thought he must suffocate, \\nthe invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was \\nstanding in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of \\nfresh, salty air. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 623 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CAVE \\n\\nHarry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a \\nlight, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at \\nmoonlit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing \\nupon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and \\nchurning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A \\ntowering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black \\nand faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the \\none upon which Harry and Dumbledore were \\nstanding, looked as though they had broken away \\nfrom the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a \\nbleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by \\nany tree or sweep of grass or sand. \\n\\n“What do you think?” asked Dumbledore. He might \\nhave been asking Harry’s opinion on whether it was a \\ngood site for a picnic. \\n\\n“They brought the kids from the orphanage here?” \\nasked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot \\nfor a day trip. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 624 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“Not here, precisely,” said Dumbledore. “There is a \\nvillage of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind \\nus. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little \\nsea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only \\never Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited \\nthis spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless \\nthey were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats \\ncannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them \\nare too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed \\ndown; magic would have served better than ropes. \\n\\nAnd he brought two small children with him, \\nprobably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think \\nthe journey alone would have done it, don’t you?” \\n\\nHarry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose \\nbumps. \\n\\n“But his final destination — and ours — lies a little \\nfarther on. Come.” \\n\\nDumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the \\nrock where a series of jagged niches made footholds \\nleading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in \\nwater and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous \\ndescent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his \\nwithered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were \\nslippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold \\nsalt spray hitting his face. \\n\\n“Lumos,” said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder \\nclosest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden \\nlight sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a \\nfew feet below where he crouched; the black wall of \\nrock beside him was illuminated too. \\n\\n“You see?” said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand \\na little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into \\nwhich dark water was swirling. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 625 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You will not object to getting a little wet?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no \\nneed for it now — and let us take the plunge.” \\n\\nAnd with the sudden agility of a much younger man, \\nDumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, \\nand began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, \\ntoward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held \\nin his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into \\nhis pocket, and followed. \\n\\nThe water was icy; Harry’s waterlogged clothes \\nbillowed around him and weighed him down. Taking \\ndeep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of \\nsalt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, \\nshrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. \\n\\nThe fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry \\ncould tell would be filled with water at high tide. The \\nslimy walls were barely three feet apart and \\nglimmered like wet tar in the passing light of \\nDumbledore ’s wand. A little way in, the passageway \\ncurved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far \\ninto the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore ’s \\nwake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the \\nrough, wet rock. \\n\\nThen he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water \\nahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When \\nHarry reached the spot he found steps that led into a \\nlarge cave. He clambered up them, water streaming \\nfrom his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering \\nuncontrollably, into the still and freezing air. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 626 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, \\nhis wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, \\nexamining the walls and ceiling. \\n\\n“Yes, this is the place,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper. \\n\\n“It has known magic,” said Dumbledore simply. \\n\\nHarry could not tell whether the shivers he was \\nexperiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or \\nto the same awareness of enchantments. He watched \\nas Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, \\nevidently concentrating on things Harry could not see. \\n\\n“This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,” \\nsaid Dumbledore after a moment or two. “We need to \\npenetrate the inner place. ... Now it is Lord \\nVoldemort’s obstacles that stand in our way, rather \\nthan those nature made. ...” \\n\\nDumbledore approached the wall of the cave and \\ncaressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring \\nwords in a strange tongue that Harry did not \\nunderstand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around \\nthe cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he \\ncould, occasionally pausing, running his fingers \\nbackward and forward over a particular spot, until \\nfinally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the \\nwall. \\n\\n“Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance \\nis concealed.” \\n\\nHarry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had \\nnever seen a wizard work things out like this, simply \\nby looking and touching; but Harry had long since \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 627 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlearned that bangs and smoke were more often the \\nmarks of ineptitude than expertise. \\n\\nDumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and \\npointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an \\narched outline appeared there, blazing white as \\nthough there was a powerful light behind the crack. \\n\\n“You’ve d-done it!” said Harry through chattering \\nteeth, but before the words had left his lips the \\noutline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid \\nas ever. Dumbledore looked around. \\n\\n“Harry, I’m so sorry, I forgot,” he said; he now pointed \\nhis wand at Harry and at once, Harry’s clothes were \\nas warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front \\nof a blazing fire. \\n\\n“Thank you,” said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore \\nhad already turned his attention back to the solid \\ncave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply \\nstood there staring at it intently, as though something \\nextremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed \\nquite still; he did not want to break Dumbledore’s \\nconcentration. Then, after two solid minutes, \\nDumbledore said quietly, “Oh, surely not. So crude.” \\n\\n“What is it, Professor?” \\n\\n“I rather think,” said Dumbledore, putting his \\nuninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a \\nshort silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop \\npotion ingredients, “that we are required to make \\npayment to pass.” \\n\\n“Payment?” said Harry. “You’ve got to give the door \\nsomething?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 628 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Blood, if I am not much \\nmistaken.” \\n\\n“Blood?” \\n\\n“I said it was crude,” said Dumbledore, who sounded \\ndisdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort \\nhad fallen short of the standards Dumbledore \\nexpected. “The idea, as I am sure you will have \\ngathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or \\nherself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to \\ngrasp that there are much more terrible things than \\nphysical injury.” \\n\\n“Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it ...” said Harry, who \\nhad experienced enough pain not to be keen for more. \\n\\n“Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,” said \\nDumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and \\nexposing the forearm of his injured hand. \\n\\n“Professor!” protested Harry, hurrying forward as \\nDumbledore raised his knife. “Ill do it, I’m — ” \\n\\nHe did not know what he was going to say — younger, \\nfitter? But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a \\nflash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face \\nwas peppered with dark, glistening drops. \\n\\n“You are very kind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, now \\npassing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had \\nmade in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just \\nas Snape had healed Malfoy’s wounds. “But your \\nblood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to \\nhave done the trick, doesn’t it?” \\n\\nThe blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in \\nthe wall once more, and this time it did not fade \\naway: The blood-spattered rock within it simply \\n\\nPage | 629 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total \\ndarkness. \\n\\n“After me, I think,” said Dumbledore, and he walked \\nthrough the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting \\nhis own wand hastily as he went. \\n\\nAn eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on \\nthe edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry \\ncould not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so \\nhigh that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty \\ngreenish light shone far away in what looked like the \\nmiddle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely \\nstill water below. The greenish glow and the light from \\nthe two wands were the only things that broke the \\notherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not \\npenetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The \\ndarkness was somehow denser than normal \\ndarkness. \\n\\n“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very \\ncareful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.” \\n\\nHe set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry \\nfollowed close behind him. Their footsteps made \\nechoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock \\nthat surrounded the water. On and on they walked, \\nbut the view did not vary: on one side of them, the \\nrough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless \\nexpanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very \\nmiddle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. \\nHarry found the place and the silence oppressive, \\nunnerving. \\n\\n“Professor?” he said finally. “Do you think the \\nHorcrux is here?” \\n\\n“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, I’m sure it is. The \\nquestion is, how do we get to it?” \\n\\nPage | 630 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We couldn’t ... we couldn’t just try a Summoning \\nCharm?” Harry said, sure that it was a stupid \\nsuggestion. But he was much keener than he was \\nprepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon \\nas possible. \\n\\n“Certainly we could,” said Dumbledore, stopping so \\nsuddenly that Harry almost walked into him. “Why \\ndon’t you do it?” \\n\\n“Me? Oh ... okay ...” \\n\\nHarry had not expected this, but cleared his throat \\nand said loudly, wand aloft, “Accio Horcruxl” \\n\\nWith a noise like an explosion, something very large \\nand pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty \\nfeet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had \\nvanished again with a crashing splash that made \\ngreat, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry \\nleapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart \\nwas still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. \\n\\n“What was that?” \\n\\n“Something, I think, that is ready to respond should \\nwe attempt to seize the Horcrux.” \\n\\nHarry looked back at the water. The surface of the \\nlake was once more shining black glass: The ripples \\nhad vanished unnaturally fast; Harry’s heart, \\nhowever, was still pounding. \\n\\n“Did you think that would happen, sir?” \\n\\n“I thought something would happen if we made an \\nobvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. \\n\\nThat was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest \\nway of finding out what we are facing.” \\n\\nPage | 631 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But we don’t know what the thing was,” said Harry, \\nlooking at the sinisterly smooth water. \\n\\n\\n\\n“What the things are, you mean,” said Dumbledore. “I \\ndoubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall \\nwe walk on?” \\n\\n“Professor?” \\n\\n“Yes, Harry?” \\n\\n“Do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake?” \\n\\n“Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.” \\n\\n“You don’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?” \\n\\n“Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle.” \\n\\nAnd Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light \\nin the center of the lake. \\n\\n“So we’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?” \\n“Yes, I think so.” \\n\\nHarry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of \\nwater monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, \\nand sprites. ... \\n\\n“Aha,” said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this \\ntime, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he \\ntoppled on the edge of the dark water, and \\nDumbledore’s uninjured hand closed tightly around \\nhis upper arm, pulling him back. “So sorry, Harry, I \\nshould have given warning. Stand back against the \\nwall, please; I think I have found the place.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 632 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this \\npatch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as \\nfar as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have \\ndetected something special about it. This time he was \\nrunning his hand, not over the rocky wall, but \\nthrough the thin air, as though expecting to find and \\ngrip something invisible. \\n\\n“Oho,” said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His \\nhand had closed in midair upon something Harry \\ncould not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; \\nHarry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore ’s \\nbuckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. \\nKeeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore \\nraised his wand with the other and tapped his fist \\nwith the point. \\n\\nImmediately a thick coppery green chain appeared \\nout of thin air, extending from the depths of the water \\ninto Dumbledore ’s clenched hand. Dumbledore \\ntapped the chain, which began to slide through his \\nfist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a \\nclinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, \\npulling something from the depths of the black water. \\nHarry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke \\nthe surface, glowing as green as the chain, and \\nfloated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the \\nbank where Harry and Dumbledore stood. \\n\\n“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked in \\nastonishment. \\n\\n“Magic always leaves traces,” said Dumbledore, as the \\nboat hit the bank with a gentle bump, “sometimes \\nvery distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know \\nhis style.” \\n\\n“Is ... is this boat safe?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 633 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a \\nmeans to cross the lake without attracting the wrath \\nof those creatures he had placed within it in case he \\never wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.” \\n\\n“So the things in the water won’t do anything to us if \\nwe cross in Voldemort’s boat?” \\n\\n“I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they \\nwill, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. \\nThus far, however, we have done well. They have \\nallowed us to raise the boat.” \\n\\n“But why have they let us?” asked Harry, who could \\nnot shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the \\ndark water the moment they were out of sight of the \\nbank. \\n\\n“Voldemort would have been reasonably confident \\nthat none but a very great wizard would have been \\nable to find the boat,” said Dumbledore. “I think he \\nwould have been prepared to risk what was, to his \\nmind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody \\nelse would find it, knowing that he had set other \\nobstacles ahead that only he would be able to \\npenetrate. We shall see whether he is right.” \\n\\nHarry looked down into the boat. It really was very \\nsmall. \\n\\n“It doesn’t look like it was built for two people. Will it \\nhold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?” \\n\\nDumbledore chuckled. \\n\\n“Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but \\nabout the amount of magical power that crossed his \\nlake. I rather think an enchantment will have been \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 634 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplaced upon this boat so that only one wizard at a \\ntime will be able to sail in it.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“But then — ?” \\n\\n“I do not think you will count, Harry: You are \\nunderage and unqualified. Voldemort would never \\nhave expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I \\nthink it unlikely that your powers will register \\ncompared to mine.” \\n\\nThese words did nothing to raise Harry’s morale; \\nperhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, \\n“Voldemort’s mistake, Harry, Voldemort’s mistake ... \\nAge is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates \\nyouth. ... Now, you first this time, and be careful not \\nto touch the water.” \\n\\nDumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully \\ninto the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the \\nchain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; \\nHarry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his \\nknees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began \\nto move at once. There was no sound other than the \\nsilken rustle of the boat’s prow cleaving the water; it \\nmoved without their help, as though an invisible rope \\nwas pulling it onward toward the light in the center. \\nSoon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; \\nthey might have been at sea except that there were no \\nwaves. \\n\\nHarry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his \\nwandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water \\nas they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples \\nupon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches \\nbelow the surface. \\n\\nPage | 635 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Professor!” he said, and his startled voice echoed \\nloudly over the silent water. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Harry?” \\n\\n“I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!” \\n\\n“Yes, I am sure you did,” said Dumbledore calmly. \\n\\nHarry stared down into the water, looking for the \\nvanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat. \\n\\n“So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?” \\n\\nBut Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could \\nreply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of \\nwater and showed him, this time, a dead man lying \\nfaceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes \\nmisted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his \\nrobes swirling around him like smoke. \\n\\n“There are bodies in here!” said Harry, and his voice \\nsounded much higher than usual and most unlike his \\nown. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore placidly, “but we do not need \\nto worry about them at the moment.” \\n\\n“At the moment?” Harry repeated, tearing his gaze \\nfrom the water to look at Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below \\nus,” said Dumbledore. “There is nothing to be feared \\nfrom a body, Harry, any more than there is anything \\nto be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who \\nof course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once \\nagain he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the \\nunknown we fear when we look upon death and \\ndarkness, nothing more.” \\n\\nPage | 636 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he \\nfound the idea that there were bodies floating around \\nthem and beneath them horrible and, what was more, \\nhe did not believe that they were not dangerous. \\n\\n“But one of them jumped,” he said, trying to make his \\nvoice as level and calm as Dumbledore ’s. “When I \\ntried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the \\nlake.” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I am sure that once we take \\nthe Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. \\nHowever, like many creatures that dwell in cold and \\ndarkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall \\ntherefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, \\nHarry,” Dumbledore added with a smile, in response \\nto Harry’s bewildered expression. \\n\\n“Oh ... right ...” said Harry quickly. He turned his \\nhead to look at the greenish glow toward which the \\nboat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend \\nnow that he was not scared. The great black lake, \\nteeming with the dead ... It seemed hours and hours \\nago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had \\ngiven Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. ... He suddenly \\nwished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and \\nhe hadn’t seen Ginny at all. ... \\n\\n“Nearly there,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. \\n\\nSure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing \\nlarger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come \\nto a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry \\ncould not see at first, but when he raised his \\nilluminated wand he saw that they had reached a \\nsmall island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Careful not to touch the water,” said Dumbledore \\nagain as Harry climbed out of the boat. \\n\\nPage | 637 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe island was no larger than Dumbledore ’s office, an \\nexpanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but \\nthe source of that greenish light, which looked much \\nbrighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at \\nfirst, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then \\nhe saw that the light was coming from a stone basin \\nrather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a \\npedestal. \\n\\nDumbledore approached the basin and Harry \\nfollowed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The \\nbasin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that \\nphosphorescent glow. \\n\\n“What is it?” asked Harry quietly. \\n\\n“I am not sure,” said Dumbledore. “Something more \\nworrisome than blood and bodies, however.” \\n\\nDumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over \\nhis blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his \\nburned fingers toward the surface of the potion. \\n\\n“Sir, no, don’t touch — !” \\n\\n“I cannot touch,” said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. \\n“See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You \\ntry.” \\n\\nStaring, Harry put his hand into the basin and \\nattempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible \\nbarrier that prevented him coming within an inch of \\nit. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers \\nencountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and \\ninflexible air. \\n\\n“Out of the way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He \\nraised his wand and made complicated movements \\nover the surface of the potion, murmuring \\n\\nPage | 638 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsoundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that \\nthe potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained \\nsilent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while \\nDumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was \\nsafe to talk again. \\n\\n“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?” \\n\\n“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the \\nbasin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in \\nthe smooth surface of the green potion. “But how to \\nreach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, \\nVanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor \\ncan it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made \\nto change its nature.” \\n\\nAlmost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand \\nagain, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the \\ncrystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. \\n\\n“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to \\nbe drunk.” \\n\\n“What?” said Harry. “No!” \\n\\n“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the \\nbasin and see what lies in its depths.” \\n\\n“But what if — what if it kills you?” \\n\\n“Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,” said \\nDumbledore easily. “Lord Voldemort would not want \\nto kill the person who reached this island.” \\n\\nHarry couldn’t believe it. Was this more of \\nDumbledore ’s insane determination to see good in \\neveryone? \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 639 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sir,” said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, \\n“sir, this is Voldemort we’re — ” \\n\\n“I’m sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not \\nwant to immediately kill the person who reached this \\nisland,” Dumbledore corrected himself. “He would \\nwant to keep them alive long enough to find out how \\nthey managed to penetrate so far through his \\ndefenses and, most importantly of all, why they were \\nso intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that \\nLord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about \\nhis Horcruxes.” \\n\\nHarry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore \\nraised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the \\nemerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. \\n\\n“Undoubtedly,” he said, finally, “this potion must act \\nin a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It \\nmight paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here \\nfor, create so much pain I am distracted, or render me \\nincapable in some other way. This being the case, \\nHarry, it will be your job to make sure I keep \\ndrinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my \\nprotesting mouth. You understand?” \\n\\nTheir eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with \\nthat strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was \\nthis why he had been invited along — so that he \\ncould force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might \\ncause him unendurable pain? \\n\\n“You remember,” said Dumbledore, “the condition on \\nwhich I brought you with me?” \\n\\nHarry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had \\nturned green in the reflected light of the basin. \\n\\n“But what if — ?” \\n\\nPage | 640 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You swore, did you not, to follow any command I \\ngave you?” \\n\\n“Yes, but — ” \\n\\n“I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?” \\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but — ” \\n\\n“Well, then,” said Dumbledore, shaking back his \\nsleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, “you \\nhave my orders.” \\n\\n“Why can’t I drink the potion instead?” asked Harry \\ndesperately. \\n\\n“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much \\nless valuable,” said Dumbledore. “Once and for all, \\nHarry, do I have your word that you will do all in your \\npower to make me keep drinking?” \\n\\n“Couldn’t — ?” \\n\\n“Do I have it?” \\n\\n“But — ” \\n\\n“ Your word, Harry.” \\n\\n“I — all right, but — ” \\n\\nBefore Harry could make any further protest, \\nDumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the \\npotion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would \\nnot be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but \\nthe crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; \\nwhen the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted \\nit to his mouth. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 641 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your good health, Harry.” \\n\\nAnd he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, \\nhis hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that \\nhis fingertips were numb. \\n\\n“Professor?” he said anxiously, as Dumbledore \\nlowered the empty glass. “How do you feel?” \\n\\nDumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry \\nwondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore \\nplunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled \\nit, and drank once more. \\n\\nIn silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the \\npotion. Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he \\nstaggered and fell forward against the basin. His eyes \\nwere still closed, his breathing heavy. \\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore?” said Harry, his voice \\nstrained. “Can you hear me?” \\n\\nDumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching \\nas though he was deeply asleep, but dreaming a \\nhorrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; \\nthe potion was about to spill from it. Harry reached \\nforward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it \\nsteady. \\n\\n“Professor, can you hear me?” he repeated loudly, his \\nvoice echoing around the cavern. \\n\\nDumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry \\ndid not recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore \\nfrightened like this. \\n\\n“I don’t want ... Don’t make me ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 642 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, \\nat the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and \\ndid not know what to do. \\n\\n\"... don’t like ... want to stop ...” moaned Dumbledore. \\n\\n“You ... you can’t stop, Professor,” said Harry. “You’ve \\ngot to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had \\nto keep drinking. Here ...” \\n\\nHating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry \\nforced the goblet back toward Dumbledore ’s mouth \\nand tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the \\nremainder of the potion inside. \\n\\n“No ...” he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back \\ninto the basin and refilled it for him. “I don’t want to. \\n...I don’t want to. ... Let me go. ...” \\n\\n“It’s all right, Professor,” said Harry, his hand \\nshaking. “It’s all right, I’m here — ” \\n\\n“Make it stop, make it stop,” moaned Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Yes ... yes, this’ll make it stop,” lied Harry. He tipped \\nthe contents of the goblet into Dumbledore ’s open \\nmouth. \\n\\nDumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around \\nthe vast chamber, across the dead black water. \\n\\n“No, no, no, no, I can’t, I can’t, don’t make me, I don’t \\nwant to. ...” \\n\\n“It’s all right, Professor, it’s all right!” said Harry \\nloudly, his hands shaking so badly he could hardly \\nscoop up the sixth gobletful of potion; the basin was \\nnow half empty. “Nothing’s happening to you, you’re \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 643 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsafe, it isn’t real, I swear it isn’t real — take this, now, \\ntake this. ...” \\n\\nAnd obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was \\nan antidote Harry offered him, but upon draining the \\ngoblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably. \\n\\n“It’s all my fault, all my fault,” he sobbed. “Please \\nmake it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it \\nstop and I’ll never, never again ...” \\n\\n“This will make it stop, Professor,” Harry said, his \\nvoice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of \\npotion into Dumbledore’s mouth. \\n\\nDumbledore began to cower as though invisible \\ntorturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost \\nknocked the refilled goblet from Harry’s trembling \\nhands as he moaned, “Don’t hurt them, don’t hurt \\nthem, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead ...” \\n\\n“Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said \\nHarry desperately, and once again Dumbledore \\nobeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his \\neyes tight shut and shook from head to foot. \\n\\nAnd now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering \\nhis fists upon the ground, while Harry filled the ninth \\ngoblet. \\n\\n“Please, please, please, no ... not that, not that, I’ll do \\nanything ...” \\n\\n“Just drink, Professor, just drink ...” \\n\\nDumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but \\nwhen he had finished, he yelled again as though his \\ninsides were on fire. “No more, please, no more ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 644 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt \\nthe crystal scrape the bottom of the basin. \\n\\n\\n\\n“We’re nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. ...” \\n\\nHe supported Dumbledore’s shoulders and again, \\nDumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was on his \\nfeet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore \\nbegan to scream in more anguish than ever, “I want \\nto die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want \\nto die!” \\n\\n“Drink this, Professor. Drink this. ...” \\n\\nDumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished \\nthan he yelled, “KILL ME!” \\n\\n“This — this one will!” gasped Harry. “Just drink this \\n... It’ll be over ... all over!” \\n\\nDumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last \\ndrop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over \\nonto his face. \\n\\n“No!” shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet \\nagain; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, \\nflung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved \\nhim over onto his back; Dumbledore’s glasses were \\naskew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. “No,” said \\nHarry, shaking Dumbledore, “no, you’re not dead, you \\nsaid it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up — \\nRennervatel” he cried, his wand pointing at \\nDumbledore’s chest; there was a flash of red light but \\nnothing happened. “Renneruate — sir — please — ” \\n\\nDumbledore’s eyelids flickered; Harry’s heart leapt. \\n\\n“Sir, are you — ?” \\n\\nPage | 645 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Water,” croaked Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Water,” panted Harry. “Yes — ” \\n\\nHe leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had \\ndropped in the basin; he barely registered the golden \\nlocket lying curled beneath it. \\n\\n“Aguamenti\\\\” he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his \\nwand. \\n\\nThe goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to \\nhis knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and \\nbrought the glass to his lips — but it was empty. \\nDumbledore groaned and began to pant. \\n\\n“But I had some — wait — AguamentiV’ said Harry \\nagain, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for \\na second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he \\napproached Dumbledore ’s mouth, the water vanished \\nagain. \\n\\n“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, \\nbut he did not think that Dumbledore could hear \\nhim; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing \\ngreat, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. \\n“Aguamenti — Aguamenti — A GUAMENTP. ” \\n\\nThe goblet filled and emptied once more. And now \\nDumbledore ’s breathing was fading. His brain \\nwhirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only \\nway left to get water, because Voldemort had planned \\nit so ... \\n\\nHe flung himself over to the edge of the rock and \\nplunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to \\nthe brim of icy water that did not vanish. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 646 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sir — here!” Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he \\ntipped the water clumsily over Dumbledore’s face. \\n\\nIt was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his \\narm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of \\nthe water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, \\nand the creature to whom it belonged was pulling \\nhim, slowly, backward across the rock. The surface of \\nthe lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was \\nchurning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads \\nand hands were emerging from the dark water, men \\nand women and children with sunken, sightless eyes \\nwere moving toward the rock: an army of the dead \\nrising from the black water. \\n\\n“Petrificus Totalusl” yelled Harry, struggling to cling to \\nthe smooth, soaked surface of the island as he \\npointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm: It \\nreleased him, falling backward into the water with a \\nsplash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi \\nwere already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands \\nclawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted \\neyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken \\nfaces leering. \\n\\n“Petrificus Totalusl” Harry bellowed again, backing \\naway as he swiped his wand through the air; six or \\nseven of them crumpled, but more were coming \\ntoward him. “Impedimental Incarcerousl ” \\n\\nA few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in \\nropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them \\nmerely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still \\nslashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, \\n\\n“ Sectumsempral SECTUMSEMPRAl” \\n\\nBut though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and \\ntheir icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked \\non, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched \\n\\nPage | 647 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoward him, and as he backed away still farther, he \\nfelt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless \\narms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as \\nthey lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and \\nsurely, back to the water, and he knew there would \\nbe no release, that he would be drowned, and become \\none more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemort’s \\nshattered soul. ... \\n\\nBut then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson \\nand gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so \\nthat the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and \\nfaltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to \\nget to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the \\nground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his \\narms, but scrambled back up, raising his wand and \\nstaring around. \\n\\nDumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the \\nsurrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire \\ndancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch \\nand from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast \\nlasso, encircling them all with warmth. \\n\\nThe Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, \\nblindly, to escape the fire in which they were \\nenclosed. ... \\n\\nDumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of \\nthe stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. \\nWordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. \\nDistracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware \\nthat their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led \\nHarry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with \\nthem, around them, the bewildered Inferi \\naccompanying them to the water’s edge, where they \\nslipped gratefully back into their dark waters. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 648 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, who was shaking all over, thought for a \\nmoment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb \\ninto the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; \\nall his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the \\nring of protective flame around them. Harry seized \\nhim and helped him back to his seat. Once they were \\nboth safely jammed inside again, the boat began to \\nmove back across the black water, away from the \\nrock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed \\nthat the Inferi swarming below them did not dare \\nresurface. \\n\\n“Sir,” panted Harry, “sir, I forgot — about fire — they \\nwere coming at me and I panicked — ” \\n\\n“Quite understandable,” murmured Dumbledore. \\nHarry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was. \\n\\nThey reached the bank with a little bump and Harry \\nleapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. \\nThe moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he \\nlet his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but \\nthe Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The \\nlittle boat sank into the water once more; clanking \\nand tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake \\ntoo. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against \\nthe cavern wall. \\n\\n“I am weak. ...” he said. \\n\\n“Don’t worry, sir,” said Harry at once, anxious about \\nDumbledore ’s extreme pallor and by his air of \\nexhaustion. “Don’t worry, I’ll get us back. ... Lean on \\nme, sir. ...” \\n\\nAnd pulling Dumbledore ’s uninjured arm around his \\nshoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around \\nthe lake, bearing most of his weight. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 649 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The protection was ... after all ... well-designed,” said \\nDumbledore faintly. “One alone could not have done \\nit. ... You did well, very well, Harry. ...” \\n\\n“Don’t talk now,” said Harry, fearing how slurred \\nDumbledore’s voice had become, how much his feet \\ndragged. “Save your energy, sir. ... We’ll soon be out \\nof here. ...” \\n\\n“The archway will have sealed again. ... My knife ...” \\n\\n“There’s no need, I got cut on the rock,” said Harry \\nfirmly. “Just tell me where. ...” \\n\\n“Here ...” \\n\\nHarry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: \\nHaving received its tribute of blood, the archway \\nreopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and \\nHarry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater \\nthat filled the crevice in the cliff. \\n\\n“It’s going to be all right, sir,” Harry said over and \\nover again, more worried by Dumbledore’s silence \\nthan he had been by his weakened voice. “We’re \\nnearly there. ... I can Apparate us both back. ... Don’t \\nworry. ...” \\n\\n“I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice \\na little stronger despite the freezing water. “I am with \\nyou.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 650 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LIGHTNING-STRUCK TOWER \\n\\nOnce back under the starry sky, Harry heaved \\nDumbledore onto the top of the nearest boulder and \\nthen to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore’s \\nweight still upon him, Harry concentrated harder \\nthan he had ever done upon his destination: \\nHogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore’s \\narm as tightly as he could, he stepped forward into \\nthat feeling of horrible compression. \\n\\nHe knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: The \\nsmell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and \\nDumbledore were shivering and dripping in the \\nmiddle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one \\nhorrible moment Harry’s imagination showed him \\nmore Inferi creeping toward him around the sides of \\nshops, but he blinked and saw that nothing was \\nstirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a \\nfew streetlamps and lit upper windows. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 651 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n“We did it, Professor!” Harry whispered with difficulty; \\nhe suddenly realized that he had a searing stitch in \\nhis chest. “We did it! We got the Horcrux!” \\n\\nDumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, \\nHarry thought that his inexpert Apparition had \\nthrown Dumbledore off balance; then he saw his face, \\npaler and damper than ever in the distant light of a \\nstreetlamp. \\n\\n“Sir, are you all right?” \\n\\n“I’ve been better,” said Dumbledore weakly, though \\nthe corners of his mouth twitched. “That potion ... \\nwas no health drink. ...” \\n\\nAnd to Harry’s horror, Dumbledore sank onto the \\nground. \\n\\n“Sir — it’s okay, sir, you’re going to be all right, don’t \\nworry — ” \\n\\nHe looked around desperately for help, but there was \\nnobody to be seen and all he could think was that he \\nmust somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the \\nhospital wing. \\n\\n“We need to get you up to the school, sir. ... Madam \\nPomfrey ...” \\n\\n“No,” said Dumbledore. “It is ... Professor Snape \\nwhom I need. ... But I do not think ... I can walk very \\nfar just yet. ...” \\n\\n“Right — sir, listen — I’m going to knock on a door, \\nfind a place you can stay — then I can run and get \\nMadam — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 652 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Severus,” said Dumbledore clearly. “I need Severus. \\n\\n\\n\\n“All right then, Snape — but I’m going to have to leave \\nyou for a moment so I can — ” \\n\\nBefore Harry could make a move, however, he heard \\nrunning footsteps. His heart leapt: Somebody had \\nseen, somebody knew they needed help — and \\nlooking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying \\ndown the dark street toward them on high-heeled, \\nfluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing gown \\nembroidered with dragons. \\n\\n“I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom \\ncurtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn’t \\nthink what to — but what’s wrong with Albus?” \\n\\nShe came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide- \\neyed, at Dumbledore. \\n\\n“He’s hurt,” said Harry. “Madam Rosmerta, can he \\ncome into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the \\nschool and get help for him?” \\n\\n“You can’t go up there alone! Don’t you realize — \\nhaven’t you seen — ? \\n\\n“If you help me support him,” said Harry, not \\nlistening to her, “I think we can get him inside — ” \\n\\n“What has happened?” asked Dumbledore. \\n\\n“Rosmerta, what’s wrong?” \\n\\n“The — the Dark Mark, Albus.” \\n\\nAnd she pointed into the sky, in the direction of \\nHogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the \\nwords. ... He turned and looked. \\n\\nPage | 653 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the \\nblazing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark \\nDeath Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a \\nbuilding ... wherever they had murdered. ... \\n\\n“When did it appear?” asked Dumbledore, and his \\nhand clenched painfully upon Harry’s shoulder as he \\nstruggled to his feet. \\n\\n“Must have been minutes ago, it wasn’t there when I \\nput the cat out, but when I got upstairs — ” \\n\\n“We need to return to the castle at once,” said \\nDumbledore. “Rosmerta” — and though he staggered \\na little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation \\n— “we need transport — brooms — ” \\n\\n“I’ve got a couple behind the bar,” she said, looking \\nvery frightened. “Shall I run and fetch — ?” \\n\\n“No, Harry can do it.” \\n\\nHarry raised his wand at once. \\n\\n“Accio Rosmerta’s Broomsl” \\n\\nA second later they heard a loud bang as the front \\ndoor of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out \\ninto the street and were racing each other to Harry’s \\nside, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly at \\nwaist height. \\n\\n“Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,” \\nsaid Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest \\nhim. “It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has \\nyet realized anything is wrong. . . . Harry, put on your \\nInvisibility Cloak.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 654 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it \\nover himself before mounting his broom: Madam \\nRosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub \\nas Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground \\nand rose up into the air. As they sped toward the \\ncastle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready \\nto grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark \\nMark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a \\nstimulant: He was bent low over his broom, his eyes \\nfixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard \\nflying behind him on the night air. And Harry too \\nlooked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him \\nlike a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, \\ndriving all other discomfort from his mind. ... \\n\\nHow long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione, \\nand Ginny’s luck run out by now? Was it one of them \\nwho had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or \\nwas it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the \\nD.A.? And if it was ... he was the one who had told \\nthem to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to \\nleave the safety of their beds. ... Would he be \\nresponsible, again, for the death of a friend? \\n\\nAs they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which \\nthey had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the \\nwhistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore \\nmuttering in some strange language again. He \\nthought he understood why as he felt his broom \\nshudder when they flew over the boundary wall into \\nthe grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the \\nenchantments he himself had set around the castle \\nso they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was \\nglittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the \\nhighest of the castle. Did that mean the death had \\noccurred there? \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 655 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore had already crossed the crenellated \\nramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed next to \\nhim seconds later and looked around. \\n\\nThe ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral \\nstaircase that led back into the castle was closed. \\nThere was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the \\ndeath, of a body. \\n\\n“What does it mean?” Harry asked Dumbledore, \\nlooking up at the green skull with its serpent’s tongue \\nglinting evilly above them. “Is it the real Mark? Has \\nsomeone definitely been — Professor?” \\n\\nIn the dim green glow from the Mark, Harry saw \\nDumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened \\nhand. \\n\\n“Go and wake Severus,” said Dumbledore faintly but \\nclearly. “Tell him what has happened and bring him \\nto me. Do nothing else, speak to nobody else, and do \\nnot remove your cloak. I shall wait here.” \\n\\n“But — ” \\n\\n“You swore to obey me, Harry — go!” \\n\\nHarry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral \\nstaircase, but his hand had only just closed upon the \\niron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps \\non the other side. He looked around at Dumbledore, \\nwho gestured him to retreat. Harry backed away, \\ndrawing his wand as he did so. \\n\\nThe door burst open and somebody erupted through \\nit and shouted, “Expelliarmus\\\\” \\n\\nHarry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile, \\nand he felt himself fall back against the tower wall, \\n\\nPage | 656 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npropped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or \\nspeak. He could not understand how it had happened \\n— Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm — \\n\\nThen, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore ’s \\nwand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts \\nand understood. ... Dumbledore had wordlessly \\nimmobilized Harry, and the second he had taken to \\nperform the spell had cost him the chance of \\ndefending himself. \\n\\nStanding against the ramparts, very white in the face, \\nDumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. \\nHe merely looked across at his disarmer and said, \\n“Good evening, Draco.” \\n\\nMalfoy stepped forward, glancing around quickly to \\ncheck that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes \\nfell upon the second broom. \\n\\n“Who else is here?” \\n\\n“A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?” \\n\\nHarry saw Malfoy’s pale eyes shift back to \\nDumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark. \\n\\n“No,” he said. “I’ve got backup. There are Death \\nEaters here in your school tonight.” \\n\\n“Well, well,” said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was \\nshowing him an ambitious homework project. “Very \\ngood indeed. You found a way to let them in, did \\nyou?” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who was panting. “Right under \\nyour nose and you never realized!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 657 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “Yet ... forgive me ... \\nwhere are they now? You seem unsupported.” \\n\\n“They met some of your guards. They’re having a fight \\ndown below. They won’t be long. ... I came on ahead. I \\n— I’ve got a job to do.” \\n\\n“Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,” \\nsaid Dumbledore softly. \\n\\nThere was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his \\nown invisible, paralyzed body, staring at the two of \\nthem, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death \\nEaters’ distant fight, and in front of him, Draco \\nMalfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore, \\nwho, incredibly, smiled. \\n\\n“Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.” \\n\\n“How do you know?” said Malfoy at once. \\n\\nHe seemed to realize how childish the words had \\nsounded; Harry saw him flush in the Mark’s greenish \\nlight. \\n\\n“You don’t know what I’m capable of,” said Malfoy \\nmore forcefully. “You don’t know what I’ve done!” \\n\\n“Oh yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly. “You almost \\nkilled Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been \\ntrying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. \\nForgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble \\nattempts. ... So feeble, to be honest, that I wonder \\nwhether your heart has been really in it.” \\n\\n“It has been in it!” said Malfoy vehemently. “I’ve been \\nworking on it all year, and tonight — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 658 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSomewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry \\nheard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced \\nover his shoulder. \\n\\n“Somebody is putting up a good fight,” said \\nDumbledore conversationally. “But you were saying ... \\nyes, you have managed to introduce Death Eaters \\ninto my school, which, I admit, I thought impossible. \\n\\n. . . How did you do it?” \\n\\nBut Malfoy said nothing: He was still listening to \\nwhatever was happening below and seemed almost as \\nparalyzed as Harry was. \\n\\n“Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,” \\nsuggested Dumbledore. “What if your backup has \\nbeen thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps \\nrealized, there are members of the Order of the \\nPhoenix here tonight too. And after all, you don’t \\nreally need help. ... I have no wand at the moment. ... \\n\\nI cannot defend myself.” \\n\\nMalfoy merely stared at him. \\n\\n“I see,” said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither \\nmoved nor spoke. “You are afraid to act until they join \\nyou.” \\n\\n“I’m not afraid!” snarled Malfoy, though he still made \\nno move to hurt Dumbledore. “It’s you who should be \\nscared!” \\n\\n“But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing \\nis not nearly as easy as the innocent believe. ... So tell \\nme, while we wait for your friends ... how did you \\nsmuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a \\nlong time to work out how to do it.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 659 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMalfoy looked as though he was fighting down the \\nurge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several \\ndeep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand \\npointing directly at the latter’s heart. Then, as though \\nhe could not help himself, he said, “I had to mend \\nthat broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one’s used for \\nyears. The one Montague got lost in last year.” \\n\\n“Aaaah.” Dumbledore’s sigh was half a groan. He \\nclosed his eyes for a moment. “That was clever. ... \\nThere is a pair, I take it?” \\n\\n“In Borgin and Burkes,” said Malfoy, “and they make \\na kind of passage between them. Montague told me \\nthat when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was \\ntrapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what \\nwas going on at school, and sometimes what was \\ngoing on in the shop, as if the cabinet was traveling \\nbetween them, but he couldn’t make anyone hear \\nhim. ... In the end, he managed to Apparate out, even \\nthough he’d never passed his test. He nearly died \\ndoing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, \\nbut I was the only one who realized what it meant — \\neven Borgin didn’t know — I was the one who realized \\nthere could be a way into Hogwarts through the \\ncabinets if I fixed the broken one.” \\n\\n“Very good,” murmured Dumbledore. “So the Death \\nEaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into \\nthe school to help you. ... A clever plan, a very clever \\nplan ... and, as you say, right under my nose.” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who bizarrely seemed to draw \\ncourage and comfort from Dumbledore’s praise. \\n\\n“Yeah, it was!” \\n\\n“But there were times,” Dumbledore went on, “weren’t \\nthere, when you were not sure you would succeed in \\nmending the cabinet? And you resorted to crude and \\n\\nPage | 660 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbadly judged measures such as sending me a cursed \\nnecklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands . . \\npoisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I \\nmight drink. ...” \\n\\n“Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind \\nthat stuff, did you?” sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore \\nslid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his \\nlegs apparently fading, and Harry struggled \\nfruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding \\nhim. \\n\\n“As a matter of fact, I did,” said Dumbledore. “I was \\nsure it was you. \\n\\n“Why didn’t you stop me, then?” Malfoy demanded. \\n\\n“I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping \\nwatch over you on my orders — ” \\n\\n“He hasn’t been doing your orders, he promised my \\nmother — ” \\n\\n“Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but \\n\\n\\n\\n“He’s a double agent, you stupid old man, he isn’t \\nworking for you, you just think he is!” \\n\\n“We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens \\nthat I trust Professor Snape — ” \\n\\n“Well, you’re losing your grip, then!” sneered Malfoy. \\n“He’s been offering me plenty of help — wanting all \\nthe glory for himself — wanting a bit of the action — \\nWhat are you doing?’ ‘Did you do the necklace, that \\nwas stupid, it could have blown everything — ’ But I \\nhaven’t told him what I’ve been doing in the Room of \\nRequirement, he’s going to wake up tomorrow and it’ll \\nPage | 661 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nall be over and he won’t be the Dark Lord’s favorite \\nanymore, he’ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Very gratifying,” said Dumbledore mildly. “We all like \\nappreciation for our own hard work, of course. But \\nyou must have had an accomplice, all the same ... \\nsomeone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to \\nslip Katie the — the — aaaah ...” \\n\\nDumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as \\nthough he was about to fall asleep. \"... of course ... \\nRosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius \\nCurse?” \\n\\n“Got there at last, have you?” Malfoy taunted. \\n\\nThere was another yell from below, rather louder than \\nthe last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder \\nagain, then back at Dumbledore, who went on: “So \\npoor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own \\nbathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts \\nstudent who entered the room unaccompanied? And \\nthe poisoned mead ... well, naturally, Rosmerta was \\nable to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to \\nSlughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas \\npresent. ... Yes, very neat ... very neat ... Poor Mr. \\nFilch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of \\nRosmerta’s. Tell me, how have you been \\ncommunicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all \\nmethods of communication in and out of the school \\nmonitored.” \\n\\n“Enchanted coins,” said Malfoy, as though he was \\ncompelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was \\nshaking badly. “I had one and she had the other and I \\ncould send her messages — ” \\n\\n“Isn’t that the secret method of communication the \\ngroup that called themselves Dumbledore ’s Army \\n\\nPage | 662 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nused last year?” asked Dumbledore. His voice was \\nlight and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an \\ninch lower down the wall as he said it. \\n\\n“Yeah, I got the idea from them,” said Malfoy, with a \\ntwisted smile. “I got the idea of poisoning the mead \\nfrom the Mudblood Granger as well, I heard her \\ntalking in the library about Filch not recognizing \\npotions.” \\n\\n“Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. \\n\\nMalfoy gave a harsh laugh. “You care about me saying \\n‘Mudblood’ when I’m about to kill you?” \\n\\n“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet \\nslide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain \\nupright. “But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you \\nhave had several long minutes now, we are quite \\nalone, I am more defenseless than you can have \\ndreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted. \\n\\n\\n\\nMalfoy’s mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he \\nhad tasted something very bitter. \\n\\n“Now, about tonight,” Dumbledore went on, “I am a \\nlittle puzzled about how it happened. ... You knew \\nthat I had left the school? But of course,” he \\nanswered his own question, “Rosmerta saw me \\nleaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious \\ncoins, I’m sure.” \\n\\n“That’s right,” said Malfoy. “But she said you were \\njust going for a drink, you’d be back. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 663 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, I certainly did have a drink ... and I came back \\n... after a fashion,” mumbled Dumbledore. “So you \\ndecided to spring a trap for me?” \\n\\n“We decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and \\nget you to hurry up here, to see who’d been killed,” \\nsaid Malfoy. “And it worked!” \\n\\n“Well ... yes and no ...” said Dumbledore. “But am I to \\ntake it, then, that nobody has been murdered?” \\n\\n“Someone’s dead,” said Malfoy, and his voice seemed \\nto go up an octave as he said it. “One of your people \\n...I don’t know who, it was dark. ... I stepped over the \\nbody. ... I was supposed to be waiting up here when \\nyou got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way. ...” \\n\\n“Yes, they do that,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\nThere was a bang and shouts from below, louder than \\never; it sounded as though people were fighting on the \\nactual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, \\nMalfoy, and Harry stood, and Harry’s heart thundered \\nunheard in his invisible chest. ... Someone was dead. \\n\\n. . . Malfoy had stepped over the body . . . but who was \\nit? \\n\\n\\n\\n“There is little time, one way or another,” said \\nDumbledore. “So let us discuss your options, Draco.” \\n\\n“My options!” said Malfoy loudly. “I’m standing here \\nwith a wand — I’m about to kill you — ” \\n\\n“My dear boy, let us have no more pretense about \\nthat. If you were going to kill me, you would have \\ndone it when you first disarmed me, you would not \\nhave stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and \\nmeans.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 664 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I haven’t got any options!” said Malfoy, and he was \\nsuddenly white as Dumbledore. “I’ve got to do it! He’ll \\nkill me! He’ll kill my whole family!” \\n\\n“I appreciate the difficulty of your position,” said \\nDumbledore. “Why else do you think I have not \\nconfronted you before now? Because I knew that you \\nwould have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized \\nthat I suspected you.” \\n\\nMalfoy winced at the sound of the name. \\n\\n“I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which \\nI knew you had been entrusted, in case he used \\nLegilimency against you,” continued Dumbledore. \\n\\n“But now at last we can speak plainly to each other. \\n\\n... No harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, \\nthough you are very lucky that your unintentional \\nvictims survived. ... I can help you, Draco.” \\n\\n“No, you can’t,” said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking \\nvery badly indeed. “Nobody can. He told me to do it or \\nhe’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.” \\n\\n“Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide \\nyou more completely than you can possibly imagine. \\nWhat is more, I can send members of the Order to \\nyour mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father \\nis safe at the moment in Azkaban. ... When the time \\ncomes, we can protect him too. Come over to the right \\nside, Draco ... you are not a killer. ...” \\n\\nMalfoy stared at Dumbledore. \\n\\n“But I got this far, didn’t I?” he said slowly. “They \\nthought I’d die in the attempt, but I’m here ... and \\nyou’re in my power. ... I’m the one with the wand. ... \\nYou’re at my mercy. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 665 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, Draco,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It is my mercy, \\nand not yours, that matters now.” \\n\\nMalfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand \\nhand still trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by \\na fraction — \\n\\nBut suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs, \\nand a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way \\nas four people in black robes burst through the door \\nonto the ramparts. Still paralyzed, his eyes staring \\nunblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four \\nstrangers: It seemed the Death Eaters had won the \\nfight below. \\n\\nA lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a \\nwheezy giggle. \\n\\n“Dumbledore cornered!” he said, and he turned to a \\nstocky little woman who looked as though she could \\nbe his sister and who was grinning eagerly. \\n“Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, \\nDraco, well done!” \\n\\n“Good evening, Amycus,” said Dumbledore calmly, as \\nthough welcoming the man to a tea party. “And you’ve \\nbrought Alecto too. ... Charming ...” \\n\\nThe woman gave an angry little titter. “Think your \\nlittle jokes’ll help you on your deathbed then?” she \\njeered. \\n\\n“Jokes? No, no, these are manners,” replied \\nDumbledore. \\n\\n“Do it,” said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a \\nbig, rangy man with matted gray hair and whiskers, \\nwhose black Death Eater’s robes looked \\nuncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that \\n\\nPage | 666 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry \\ncould smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat, and, \\nunmistakably, of blood coming from him. His filthy \\nhands had long yellowish nails. \\n\\n“Is that you, Fenrir?” asked Dumbledore. \\n\\n“That’s right,” rasped the other. “Pleased to see me, \\nDumbledore?” \\n\\n“No, I cannot say that I am.” \\n\\nGreyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood \\ntrickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, \\nobscenely. \\n\\n“But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“Am I to take it that you are attacking even without \\nthe full moon now? This is most unusual. ... You have \\ndeveloped a taste for human flesh that cannot be \\nsatisfied once a month?” \\n\\n“That’s right,” said Fenrir Greyback. “Shocks you \\nthat, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?” \\n\\n“Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. “And, yes, I am a little shocked that \\nDraco here invited you, of all people, into the school \\nwhere his friends live. ...” \\n\\n“I didn’t,” breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at \\nFenrir; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. \\n“I didn’t know he was going to come — ” \\n\\n“I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, \\nDumbledore,” rasped Greyback. “Not when there are \\nthroats to be ripped out... Delicious, delicious ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 667 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his \\nfront teeth, leering at Dumbledore. “I could do you for \\nafters, Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“No,” said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a \\nheavy, brutal-looking face. “We’ve got orders. Draco’s \\ngot to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.” \\n\\nMalfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He \\nlooked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore ’s face, \\nwhich was even paler, and rather lower than usual, \\nas he had slid so far down the rampart wall. \\n\\n“He’s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!” \\nsaid the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his \\nsister’s wheezing giggles. “Look at him — what’s \\nhappened to you, then, Dumby?” \\n\\n“Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,” \\nsaid Dumbledore. “Old age, in short ... One day, \\nperhaps, it will happen to you ... if you are lucky. ...” \\n\\n“What’s that mean, then, what’s that mean?” yelled \\nthe Death Eater, suddenly violent. “Always the same, \\nweren’t yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, \\nnothing. I don’t even know why the Dark Lord’s \\nbothering to kill yer! Come on, Draco, do it!” \\n\\nBut at that moment there were renewed sounds of \\nscuffling from below and a voice shouted, “ They’ve \\nblocked the stairs — Reductol REDUCTOl” \\n\\nHarry’s heart leapt: So these four had not eliminated \\nall opposition, but merely broken through the fight to \\nthe top of the tower, and, by the sound of it, created a \\nbarrier behind them — \\n\\n“Now, Draco, quickly!” said the brutal-faced man \\nangrily. \\n\\nPage | 668 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Malfoy’s hand was shaking so badly that he could \\nbarely aim. \\n\\n“I’ll do it,” snarled Fenrir, moving toward Dumbledore \\nwith his hands outstretched, his teeth bared. \\n\\n“I said no!” shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a \\nflash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the \\nway; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking \\nfurious. Harry’s heart was hammering so hard it \\nseemed impossible that nobody could hear him \\nstanding there, imprisoned by Dumbledore ’s spell — \\nif he could only move, he could aim a curse from \\nunder the cloak — \\n\\n“Draco, do it or stand aside so one of us — ” screeched \\nthe woman, but at that precise moment, the door to \\nthe ramparts burst open once more and there stood \\nSnape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black \\neyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped \\nagainst the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including \\nthe enraged werewolf, and Malfoy. \\n\\n“We’ve got a problem, Snape,” said the lumpy \\nAmycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon \\nDumbledore, “the boy doesn’t seem able — ” \\n\\nBut somebody else had spoken Snape’s name, quite \\nsoftly. \\n\\n“Severus ...” \\n\\nThe sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had \\nexperienced all evening. For the first time, \\n\\nDumbledore was pleading. \\n\\nSnape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed \\nMalfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 669 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed \\ncowed. \\n\\nSnape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there \\nwas revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of \\nhis face. \\n\\n“Severus ... please ...” \\n\\nSnape raised his wand and pointed it directly at \\nDumbledore. \\n\\n“Avada KedavraV’ \\n\\nA jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand \\nand hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry’s \\nscream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, \\nhe was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted \\ninto the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang \\nsuspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell \\nslowly backward, like a great rag doll, over the \\nbattlements and out of sight. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 670 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFLIGHT OF THE PRINCE \\n\\nHarry felt as though he too were hurtling through \\nspace; it had not happened. ...It could not have \\nhappened. ... \\n\\n“Out of here, quickly,” said Snape. \\n\\nHe seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced \\nhim through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and \\nthe squat brother and sister followed, the latter both \\npanting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, \\nHarry realized he could move again. What was now \\nholding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, \\nbut horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak \\naside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave \\nthe tower top, was disappearing through the door. \\n\\n“Petrificus Totalusl” \\n\\nThe Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back \\nwith something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a \\nwaxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 671 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nwas clambering over him and running down the \\ndarkened staircase. \\n\\nTerror tore at Harry’s heart. ... He had to get to \\nDumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ... Somehow \\nthe two things were linked. ... He could reverse what \\nhad happened if he had them both together. . . . \\nDumbledore could not have died. ... \\n\\nHe leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and \\nstopped where he landed, his wand raised: The dimly \\nlit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to \\nhave fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but \\neven as he attempted to make out who was fighting \\nwhom, he heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time \\nto go\\\\” and saw Snape disappearing around the corner \\nat the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed \\nto have forced their way through the fight unscathed. \\nAs Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters \\ndetached themselves from the fray and flew at him: It \\nwas the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry \\nbefore Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell \\nbackward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the \\nstench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, \\nhot greedy breath at his throat — \\n\\n“Petrificus Totalusl” \\n\\nHarry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a \\nstupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and \\nonto the floor as a jet of green light came flying \\ntoward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the \\nfight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on \\nthe floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies \\nlying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but \\nthere was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red \\nhair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was \\nlocked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, \\nAmycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while \\nPage | 672 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshe dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the \\nsport: “Crucio — Crucio — you can’t dance forever, \\npretty — ” \\n\\n“Impedimenta).” yelled Harry. \\n\\nHis jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike \\nsqueal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed \\ninto the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of \\nsight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, \\neach of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. \\nBeyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous \\nblond wizard who was sending curses flying in all \\ndirections, so that they ricocheted off the walls \\naround them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest \\nwindow — \\n\\n“Harry, where did you come from?” Ginny cried, but \\nthere was no time to answer her. He put his head \\ndown and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast \\nthat erupted over his head, showering them all in bits \\nof wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up \\nwith Snape — \\n\\n“Take that\\\\” shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry \\nglimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting \\naway down the corridor with her arms over her head, \\nher brother right behind her. He launched himself \\nafter them but his foot caught on something, and next \\nmoment he was lying across someone’s legs. Looking \\naround, he saw Neville’s pale, round face flat against \\nthe floor. \\n\\n“Neville, are you — ?” \\n\\n“M’all right,” muttered Neville, who was clutching his \\nstomach, “Harry ... Snape ’n’ Malfoy ... ran past ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 673 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know, I’m on it!” said Harry, aiming a hex from the \\nfloor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was \\ncausing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of \\npain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled \\naround, staggered, and then pounded away after the \\nbrother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor \\nand began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the \\nbangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others \\nto come back, and the mute call of the figures on the \\nground whose fate he did not yet know. ... \\n\\nHe skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery \\nwith blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it \\npossible that he had already entered the cabinet in \\nthe Room of Requirement, or had the Order made \\nsteps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters \\nretreating that way? He could hear nothing but his \\nown pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he \\nsprinted along the next empty corridor, but then \\nspotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of \\nthe fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front \\ndoors — perhaps the Room of Requirement was \\nindeed blocked — \\n\\nHe skidded around another corner and a curse flew \\npast him; he dived behind a suit of armor that \\nexploded. He saw the brother and sister running \\ndown the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at \\nthem, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a \\nportrait on the landing, who ran screeching into \\nneighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of \\narmor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other \\npeople within the castle seemed to have awoken. ... \\n\\nHe pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the \\nbrother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, \\nwho must surely have reached the grounds by now. \\nRemembering to leap the vanishing step halfway \\ndown the concealed staircase, he burst through a \\nPage | 674 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a \\nnumber of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs \\nstood. \\n\\n“Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said \\nsomething about the Dark Mark — ” began Ernie \\nMacmillan. \\n\\n“Out of the way!” yelled Harry, knocking two boys \\naside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the \\nremainder of the marble staircase. The oak front \\ndoors had been blasted open, there were smears of \\nblood on the flagstones, and several terrified students \\nstood huddled against the walls, one or two still \\ncowering with their arms over their faces. The giant \\nGryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the \\nrubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto \\nthe flagstones below. \\n\\nHarry flew across the entrance hall and out into the \\ndark grounds: He could just make out three figures \\nracing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond \\nwhich they could Disapparate — by the looks of them, \\nthe huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of \\nhim, Snape and Malfoy ... \\n\\nThe cold night air ripped at Harry’s lungs as he tore \\nafter them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that \\nmomentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know \\nwhat it was but continued to run, not yet near \\nenough to get a good aim with a curse — \\n\\nAnother flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and \\nHarry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his \\ncabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters \\nescaping, and though every breath seemed to shred \\nhis lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, \\nHarry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: \\nnot Hagrid . . . not Hagrid too . . . \\n\\nPage | 675 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSomething caught Harry hard in the small of the back \\nand he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, \\nblood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as \\nhe rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and \\nsister he had overtaken using his shortcut were \\nclosing in behind him. ... \\n\\n“Impedimenta).” he yelled as he rolled over again, \\ncrouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously \\nhis jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, \\ntripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and \\nsprinted on after Snape. \\n\\nAnd now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, \\nilluminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed \\nsuddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was \\naiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but \\nHagrid’s immense strength and the toughened skin \\nhe had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to \\nbe protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were \\nstill running; they would soon be beyond the gates, \\nable to Disapparate — \\n\\nHarry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at \\nSnape’s back, and yelled, “Stupefy\\\\” \\n\\nHe missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape’s \\nhead; Snape shouted, “Run, Draco\\\\” and turned. \\nTwenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each \\nother before raising their wands simultaneously. \\n\\n“Cruc — ” \\n\\nBut Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry \\nbackward off his feet before he could complete it; \\nHarry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the \\nhuge Death Eater behind him yelled, “Incendiol” Harry \\nheard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light \\nspilled over all of them: Hagrid’s house was on fire. \\nPage | 676 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Fang’s in there, yer evil — !” Hagrid bellowed. \\n\\n“Cruc — ” yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for \\nthe figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, \\nbut Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see \\nhim sneering. \\n\\n“No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!” he \\nshouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid’s yells, \\nand the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. “You haven’t \\ngot the nerve or the ability — ” \\n\\n“Incarc — ” Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell \\nwith an almost lazy flick of his arm. \\n\\n“Fight back!” Harry screamed at him. “Fight back, you \\ncowardly — ” \\n\\n“Coward, did you call me, Potter?” shouted Snape. \\n“Your father would never attack me unless it was four \\non one, what would you call him, I wonder?” \\n\\n“ Stupe — ” \\n\\n“Blocked again and again and again until you learn to \\nkeep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!” \\nsneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. “Now \\ncome!” he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind \\nHarry. “It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns \\nup — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Impedi — ” \\n\\nBut before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain \\nhit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was \\nscreaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape \\nwas going to torture him to death or madness — \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 677 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No!” roared Snape’s voice and the pain stopped as \\nsuddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the \\ndark grass, clutching his wand and panting; \\nsomewhere overhead Snape was shouting, “Have you \\nforgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord \\n— we are to leave him! Go! Go!” \\n\\nAnd Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as \\nthe brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater \\nobeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an \\ninarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not \\nwhether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet \\nagain, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he \\nnow hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself — \\n\\n“Sectum — !” \\n\\nSnape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet \\nagain; but Harry was mere feet away now and he \\ncould see Snape’s face clearly at last: He was no \\nlonger sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed \\na face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of \\nconcentration, Harry thought, Levi — \\n\\n“No, Potter!” screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG \\nand Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground \\nhard again, and this time his wand flew out of his \\nhand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling \\nas Snape closed in and looked down on him where he \\nlay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had \\nbeen. Snape’s pale face, illuminated by the flaming \\ncabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been \\nbefore he had cursed Dumbledore. \\n\\n“You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It \\nwas I who invented them — I, the Half-Blood Prince! \\nAnd you’d turn my inventions on me, like your filthy \\nfather, would you? I don’t think so ... no!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 678 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it \\nand it flew feet away into the darkness and out of \\nsight. \\n\\n“Kill me then,” panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, \\nbut only rage and contempt. “Kill me like you killed \\nhim, you coward — ” \\n\\n“DONT — ” screamed Snape, and his face was \\nsuddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in \\nas much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the \\nburning house behind them — “CALL ME COWARD!” \\n\\nAnd he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, \\nwhiplike something hit him across the face and was \\nslammed backward into the ground. Spots of light \\nburst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the \\nbreath seemed to have gone from his body, then he \\nheard a rush of wings above him and something \\nenormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at \\nSnape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp \\nclaws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a \\nsitting position, his head still swimming from its last \\ncontact with the ground, he saw Snape running as \\nhard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind \\nhim and screeching as Harry had never heard him \\nscreech — \\n\\nHarry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for \\nhis wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his \\nfingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he \\nknew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the \\ntime he had located his wand, he turned only to see \\nthe hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed \\nto Disapparate just beyond the school’s boundaries. \\n\\n“Hagrid,” muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \\n“HAGRID?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 679 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stumbled toward the burning house as an \\nenormous figure emerged from out of the flames \\ncarrying Fang on his back. With a cry of \\nthankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was \\nshaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and \\nhis breath came in painful stabs. \\n\\n“Yeh all righ’, Harry? Yeh all righ’? Speak ter me, \\nHarry. ...” \\n\\nHagrid’s huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, \\nblocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood \\nand dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang’s \\nreassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside \\nhim. \\n\\n“I’m all right,” panted Harry. “Are you?” \\n\\n“ ’Course I am ... take more’n that ter finish me.” \\n\\nHagrid put his hands under Harry’s arms and raised \\nhim up with such force that Harry’s feet momentarily \\nleft the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. \\n\\nHe could see blood trickling down Hagrid’s cheek \\nfrom a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling \\nrapidly. \\n\\n“We should put out your house,” said Harry, “the \\ncharm’s ‘Aguamenti’ ...” \\n\\n“Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled Hagrid, \\nand he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella \\nand said, “Aguamenti\\\\” \\n\\nA jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry \\nraised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and \\nmurmured “Aguamenti’ too: Together, he and Hagrid \\npoured water on the house until the last flame was \\nextinguished. \\n\\nPage | 680 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“S’not too bad,” said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes \\nlater, looking at the smoking wreck. “Nothin’ \\nDumbledore won’ be able to put righ’ ...” \\n\\nHarry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound \\nof the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror \\nrose inside him. \\n\\n“Hagrid ...” \\n\\n“I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I \\nheard ’em cornin’,” said Hagrid sadly, still staring at \\nhis wrecked cabin. “They’ll’ve bin burnt ter twigs, \\npoor little things. ...” \\n\\n“Hagrid ...” \\n\\n“But what happened, Harry? I jus’ saw them Death \\nEaters runnin’ down from the castle, but what the \\nruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ’em? Where’s he gone \\n— was he chasin’ them?” \\n\\n“He ...” Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic \\nand the smoke. “Hagrid, he killed ...” \\n\\n“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. \\n“Snape killed? What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?” \\n\\n“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed ... \\nDumbledore.” \\n\\nHagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that \\ncould be seen completely blank, uncomprehending. \\n\\n“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?” \\n\\n“He’s dead. Snape killed him. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 681 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill \\nDumbledore — don’ be stupid, Harry. Wha’s made \\nyeh say tha’?” \\n\\n“I saw it happen.” \\n\\n“Yeh couldn’ have.” \\n\\n“I saw it, Hagrid.” \\n\\nHagrid shook his head; his expression was \\ndisbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that \\nHagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, \\nthat he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a \\njinx. ... \\n\\n“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told \\nSnape ter go with them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said \\nconfidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his cover. \\n\\nLook, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, \\nHarry. ...” \\n\\nHarry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still \\nshaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon \\nenough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back \\ntoward the castle, Harry saw that many of its \\nwindows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the \\nscenes inside as people moved from room to room, \\ntelling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that \\nthe Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody \\nmust have been killed. ... \\n\\nThe oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light \\nflooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, \\nuncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping \\ndown the steps, looking around nervously for some \\nsign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. \\nHarry’s eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at \\nthe foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he \\nPage | 682 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncould see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass \\nthere, though he was really too far away to see \\nanything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at \\nthe place where he thought Dumbledore ’s body must \\nlie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward \\nit. \\n\\n“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said Hagrid, as he and \\nHarry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as \\nclose as he could to their ankles. “Wha’s tha’, lyin’ on \\nthe grass?” Hagrid added sharply, heading now \\ntoward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a \\nsmall crowd was congregating. “See it, Harry? Righ’ at \\nthe foot o’ the tower? Under where the Mark ... Blimey \\n... yeh don’ think someone got thrown — ?” \\n\\nHagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible \\nto express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling \\nthe aches and pains in his face and his legs where the \\nvarious hexes of the last half hour had hit him, \\nthough in an oddly detached way, as though \\nsomebody near him was suffering them. What was \\nreal and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in \\nhis chest. ... \\n\\nHe and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the \\nmurmuring crowd to the very front, where the \\ndumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap. \\n\\nHarry heard Hagrid ’s moan of pain and shock, but he \\ndid not stop; he walked slowly forward until he \\nreached the place where Dumbledore lay and \\ncrouched down beside him. He had known there was \\nno hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind \\nCurse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, \\nknown that it could have happened only because its \\ncaster was dead, but there was still no preparation for \\nseeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest \\nwizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet. \\n\\nPage | 683 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore’s eyes were closed; but for the strange \\nangle of his arms and legs, he might have been \\nsleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half- \\nmoon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a \\ntrickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. \\nThen he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to \\nabsorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: \\nthat never again would Dumbledore speak to him, \\nnever again could he help. ... \\n\\nThe crowd murmured behind Harry. After what \\nseemed like a long time, he became aware that he was \\nkneeling upon something hard and looked down. \\n\\nThe locket they had managed to steal so many hours \\nbefore had fallen out of Dumbledore’s pocket. It had \\nopened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the \\nground. And although he could not feel more shock or \\nhorror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, \\nas he picked it up, that there was something wrong. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned the locket over in his hands. This was \\nneither as large as the locket he remembered seeing \\nin the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, \\nno sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be \\nSlytherin’s mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside \\nbut for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly \\ninto the place where a portrait should have been. \\n\\nAutomatically, without really thinking about what he \\nwas doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of \\nparchment, opened it, and read by the light of the \\nmany wands that had now been lit behind him: \\n\\nTo the Dark Lord \\n\\nI know I will be dead long before you read this \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 684 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbut I want you to know that it was I who discovered \\nyour secret \\n\\nI have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it \\nas soon as I can. \\n\\nI face death in the hope that when you meet your \\nmatch, \\n\\nyou will be mortal once more. \\n\\nR.A.B. \\n\\nHarry neither knew nor cared what the message \\nmeant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a \\nHorcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by \\ndrinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry \\ncrumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes \\nburned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 685 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nz? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE PHOENIX LAMENT \\n\\n“C’mere, Harry ...” \\n\\n“No.” \\n\\n“Yeh can’ stay here, Harry. ... Come on, now. ...” \\n\\n“No.” \\n\\nHe did not want to leave Dumbledore’s side, he did \\nnot want to move anywhere. Hagrid’s hand on his \\nshoulder was trembling. Then another voice said, \\n“Harry, come on.” \\n\\nA much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his \\nand was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure \\nwithout really thinking about it. Only as he walked \\nblindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a \\ntrace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny \\nwho was leading him back into the castle. \\nIncomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and \\nshouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and \\nGinny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance \\nPage | 686 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nhall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry’s vision, \\npeople were peering at him, whispering, wondering, \\nand Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops \\nof blood as they made their way toward the marble \\nstaircase. \\n\\n“We’re going to the hospital wing,” said Ginny. \\n\\n“I’m not hurt,” said Harry. \\n\\n“It’s McGonagall’s orders,” said Ginny. “Everyone’s up \\nthere, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone — ” \\n\\nFear stirred in Harry’s chest again: He had forgotten \\nthe inert figures he had left behind. \\n\\n“Ginny, who else is dead?” \\n\\n“Don’t worry, none of us.” \\n\\n“But the Dark Mark — Malfoy said he stepped over a \\nbody — ” \\n\\n“He stepped over Bill, but it’s all right, he’s alive.” \\n\\nThere was something in her voice, however, that \\nHarry knew boded ill. \\n\\n“Are you sure?” \\n\\n“Of course I’m sure ... he’s a — a bit of a mess, that’s \\nall. Greyback attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he \\nwon’t — won’t look the same anymore. ...” \\n\\nGinny ’s voice trembled a little. \\n\\n“We don’t really know what the aftereffects will be — I \\nmean, Greyback being a werewolf, but not \\ntransformed at the time.” \\n\\nPage | 687 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But the others . . . There were other bodies on the \\nground. ...” \\n\\n“Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but \\nMadam Pomfrey says they’ll be all right. And a Death \\nEater’s dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge \\nblond one was firing off everywhere — Harry, if we \\nhadn’t had your Felix potion, I think we’d all have \\nbeen killed, but everything seemed to just miss us — ” \\n\\nThey had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open \\nthe doors, Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, \\nin a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, \\nand Lupin were gathered around another bed near \\nthe far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors \\nopening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Harry \\nand hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking \\nanxious. \\n\\n“Are you all right, Harry?” \\n\\n“I’m fine. ... How’s Bill?” \\n\\nNobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione’s \\nshoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on \\nBill’s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he \\nlooked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his \\nwounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. \\nHarry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoy’s \\nSectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand. \\n\\n“Can’t you fix them with a charm or something?” he \\nasked the matron. \\n\\n“No charm will work on these,” said Madam Pomfrey. \\n“I’ve tried everything I know, but there is no cure for \\nwerewolf bites.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 688 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But he wasn’t bitten at the full moon,” said Ron, who \\nwas gazing down into his brother’s face as though he \\ncould somehow force him to mend just by staring. \\n“Greyback hadn’t transformed, so surely Bill won’t be \\na — a real — ?” \\n\\nHe looked uncertainly at Lupin. \\n\\n“No, I don’t think that Bill will be a true werewolf,” \\nsaid Lupin, “but that does not mean that there won’t \\nbe some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. \\nThey are unlikely ever to heal fully, and — and Bill \\nmight have some wolfish characteristics from now \\non.” \\n\\n“Dumbledore might know something that’d work, \\nthough,” Ron said. “Where is he? Bill fought those \\nmaniacs on Dumbledore’s orders, Dumbledore owes \\nhim, he can’t leave him in this state — ” \\n\\n“Ron — Dumbledore’s dead,” said Ginny. \\n\\n“No!” Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as \\nthough hoping the latter might contradict her, but \\nwhen Harry did not, Lupin collapsed into a chair \\nbeside Bill’s bed, his hands over his face. Harry had \\nnever seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as though \\nhe was intruding upon something private, indecent. \\n\\nHe turned away and caught Ron’s eye instead, \\nexchanging in silence a look that confirmed what \\nGinny had said. \\n\\n“How did he die?” whispered Tonks. “How did it \\nhappen?” \\n\\n“Snape killed him,” said Harry. “I was there, I saw it. \\nWe arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because \\nthat’s where the Mark was. ... Dumbledore was ill, he \\nwas weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when \\n\\nPage | 689 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe heard footsteps running up the stairs. He \\nimmobilized me, I couldn’t do anything, I was under \\nthe Invisibility Cloak — and then Malfoy came \\nthrough the door and disarmed him — ” \\n\\nHermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron \\ngroaned. Luna’s mouth trembled. \\n\\n“ — more Death Eaters arrived — and then Snape — \\nand Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra.” Harry couldn’t \\ngo on. \\n\\nMadam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her \\nany attention except Ginny, who whispered, “Shh! \\nListen!” \\n\\nGulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her \\nmouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the \\ndarkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had \\nnever heard before: a stricken lament of terrible \\nbeauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix \\nsong before, that the music was inside him, not \\nwithout: It was his own grief turned magically to song \\nthat echoed across the grounds and through the \\ncastle windows. \\n\\nHow long they all stood there, listening, he did not \\nknow, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to \\nlisten to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a \\nlong time later that the hospital door opened again \\nand Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all \\nthe rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There \\nwere grazes on her face and her robes were ripped. \\n\\n“Molly and Arthur are on their way,” she said, and the \\nspell of the music was broken: Everyone roused \\nthemselves as though coming out of trances, turning \\nagain to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyes, \\nshake their heads. “Harry, what happened? According \\nPage | 690 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when \\nhe — when it happened. He says Professor Snape was \\ninvolved in some — ” \\n\\n“Snape killed Dumbledore,” said Harry. \\n\\nShe stared at him for a moment, then swayed \\nalarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have \\npulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair \\nfrom thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall. \\n\\n“Snape,” repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the \\nchair. “We all wondered ... but he trusted ... always ... \\nSnape ... I can’t believe it. ...” \\n\\n“Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,” said \\nLupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. “We \\nalways knew that.” \\n\\n“But Dumbledore swore he was on our side!” \\nwhispered Tonks. “I always thought Dumbledore \\nmust know something about Snape that we didn’t. ...” \\n\\n“He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for \\ntrusting Snape,” muttered Professor McGonagall, now \\ndabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a \\ntartan- edged handkerchief. “I mean ... with Snape ’s \\nhistory ... of course people were bound to wonder . . . \\nbut Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape ’s \\nrepentance was absolutely genuine. ... Wouldn’t hear \\na word against him!” \\n\\n“I’d love to know what Snape told him to convince \\nhim,” said Tonks. \\n\\n“I know,” said Harry, and they all turned to look at \\nhim. “Snape passed Voldemort the information that \\nmade Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then \\nSnape told Dumbledore he hadn’t realized what he \\n\\nPage | 691 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas doing, he was really sorry he’d done it, sorry that \\nthey were dead.” \\n\\nThey all stared at him. \\n\\n“And Dumbledore believed that?” said Lupin \\nincredulously. “Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry \\nJames was dead? Snape hated James. ...” \\n\\n“And he didn’t think my mother was worth a damn \\neither,” said Harry, “because she was Muggle-born. ... \\n‘Mudblood,’ he called her. ...” \\n\\nNobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them \\nseemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest \\nthe monstrous truth of what had happened. \\n\\n“This is all my fault,” said Professor McGonagall \\nsuddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet \\nhandkerchief in her hands. “My fault. I sent Filius to \\nfetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come \\nand help us! If I hadn’t alerted Snape to what was \\ngoing on, he might never have joined forces with the \\nDeath Eaters. I don’t think he knew they were there \\nbefore Filius told him, I don’t think he knew they were \\ncoming.” \\n\\n“It isn’t your fault, Minerva,” said Lupin firmly. “We \\nall wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape \\nwas on his way. ...” \\n\\n“So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the \\nDeath Eaters’ side?” asked Harry, who wanted every \\ndetail of Snape ’s duplicity and infamy, feverishly \\ncollecting more reasons to hate him, to swear \\nvengeance. \\n\\n“I don’t know exactly how it happened,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall distractedly. “It’s all so confusing. ... \\n\\nPage | 692 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the \\nschool for a few hours and that we were to patrol the \\ncorridors just in case ... Remus, Bill, and \\nNymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled. \\n\\nAll seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the \\nschool was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. \\nThere were powerful enchantments on every entrance \\ninto the castle. I still don’t know how the Death \\nEaters can possibly have entered. ...” \\n\\n“I do,” said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the \\npair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway \\nthey formed. “So they got in through the Room of \\nRequirement.” \\n\\nAlmost against his will he glanced from Ron to \\nHermione, both of whom looked devastated. \\n\\n“I messed up, Harry,” said Ron bleakly. “We did like \\nyou told us: We checked the Marauder’s Map and we \\ncouldn’t see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in \\nthe Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville \\nwent to keep watch on it ... but Malfoy got past us.” \\n\\n“He came out of the room about an hour after we \\nstarted keeping watch,” said Ginny. “He was on his \\nown, clutching that awful shriveled arm — ” \\n\\n“His Hand of Glory,” said Ron. “Gives light only to the \\nholder, remember?” \\n\\n“Anyway,” Ginny went on, “he must have been \\nchecking whether the coast was clear to let the Death \\nEaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw \\nsomething into the air and it all went pitch-black — ” \\n\\n“ — Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said Ron \\nbitterly. “Fred and George’s. I’m going to be having a \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 693 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nword with them about who they let buy their \\nproducts.” \\n\\n“We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,” said Ginny. \\n“Nothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could \\ndo was grope our way out of the corridor again, and \\nmeanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. \\nObviously Malfoy could see because of that hand \\nthing and was guiding them, but we didn’t dare use \\nany curses or anything in case we hit each other, and \\nby the time we’d reached a corridor that was light, \\nthey’d gone.” \\n\\n“Luckily,” said Lupin hoarsely, “Ron, Ginny, and \\nNeville ran into us almost immediately and told us \\nwhat had happened. We found the Death Eaters \\nminutes later, heading in the direction of the \\nAstronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn’t expected \\nmore people to be on the watch; he seemed to have \\nexhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any \\nrate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave \\nchase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed \\nup the tower stairs — ” \\n\\n“To set off the Mark?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“He must have done, yes, they must have arranged \\nthat before they left the Room of Requirement,” said \\nLupin. “But I don’t think Gibbon liked the idea of \\nwaiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he \\ncame running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and \\nwas hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.” \\n\\n“So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement \\nwith Ginny and Neville,” said Harry, turning to \\nHermione, “were you — ?” \\n\\n“Outside Snape’s office, yes,” whispered Hermione, \\nher eyes sparkling with tears, “with Luna. We hung \\n\\nPage | 694 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naround for ages outside it and nothing happened. ... \\nWe didn’t know what was going on upstairs, Ron had \\ntaken the map. ... It was nearly midnight when \\nProfessor Flitwick came sprinting down into the \\ndungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in \\nthe castle, I don’t think he really registered that Luna \\nand I were there at all, he just burst his way into \\nSnape’s office and we heard him saying that Snape \\nhad to go back with him and help and then we heard \\na loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his \\nroom and he saw us and — and — ” \\n\\n“What?” Harry urged her. \\n\\n“I was so stupid, Harry!” said Hermione in a high- \\npitched whisper. “He said Professor Flitwick had \\ncollapsed and that we should go and take care of him \\nwhile he — while he went to help fight the Death \\nEaters — ” She covered her face in shame and \\ncontinued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice \\nwas muffled. “We went into his office to see if we \\ncould help Professor Flitwick and found him \\nunconscious on the floor ... and oh, it’s so obvious \\nnow, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we \\ndidn’t realize, Harry, we didn’t realize, we just let \\nSnape go!” \\n\\n“It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly. “Hermione, \\nhad you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he \\nprobably would have killed you and Luna.” \\n\\n“So then he came upstairs,” said Harry, who was \\nwatching Snape running up the marble staircase in \\nhis mind’s eye, his black robes billowing behind him \\nas ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he \\nascended, “and he found the place where you were all \\nfighting. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 695 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We were in trouble, we were losing,” said Tonks in a \\nlow voice. “Gibbon was down, but the rest of the \\nDeath Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. \\nNeville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by \\nGreyback ... It was all dark . . . curses flying \\neverywhere ... The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must \\nhave slipped past, up the stairs ... then more of them \\nran after him, but one of them blocked the stair \\nbehind them with some kind of curse. ... Neville ran \\nat it and got thrown up into the air — ” \\n\\n“None of us could break through,” said Ron, “and that \\nmassive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over \\nthe place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely \\nmissing us. ...” \\n\\n“And then Snape was there,” said Tonks, “and then \\nhe wasn’t — ” \\n\\n“I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death \\nEater’s jinx just missed me right afterward and I \\nducked and lost track of things,” said Ginny. \\n\\n“I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as \\nthough it wasn’t there,” said Lupin. “I tried to follow \\nhim, but was thrown back just like Neville. ...” \\n\\n“He must have known a spell we didn’t,” whispered \\nMcGonagall. “After all — he was the Defense Against \\nthe Dark Arts teacher. ... I just assumed that he was \\nin a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who’d \\nescaped up to the tower. ...” \\n\\n“He was,” said Harry savagely, “but to help them, not \\nto stop them ... and I’ll bet you had to have a Dark \\nMark to get through that barrier — so what happened \\nwhen he came back down?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 696 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that \\ncaused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the \\ncurse blocking the stairs,” said Lupin. “We all ran \\nforward — those of us who were still standing anyway \\n— and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the \\ndust — obviously, none of us attacked them — ” \\n\\n“We just let them pass,” said Tonks in a hollow voice. \\n“We thought they were being chased by the Death \\nEaters — and next thing, the other Death Eaters and \\nGreyback were back and we were fighting again — I \\nthought I heard Snape shout something, but I don’t \\nknow what — ” \\n\\n“He shouted, ‘It’s over,’ ” said Harry. “He’d done what \\nhe’d meant to do.” \\n\\nThey all fell silent. Fawkes’s lament was still echoing \\nover the dark grounds outside. As the music \\nreverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome \\nthoughts slunk into Harry’s mind. ... Had they taken \\nDumbledore’s body from the foot of the tower yet? \\nWhat would happen to it next? Where would it rest? \\nHe clenched his fists tightly in his pockets. He could \\nfeel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against \\nthe knuckles of his right hand. \\n\\nThe doors of the hospital wing burst open, making \\nthem all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up \\nthe ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face \\nterrified. \\n\\n“Molly — Arthur — ” said Professor McGonagall, \\njumping up and hurrying to greet them. “I am so \\nsorry — ” \\n\\n“Bill,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor \\nMcGonagall as she caught sight of Bill’s mangled face. \\n“Oh, Bill\\'.” \\n\\nPage | 697 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so \\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the \\nbed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her \\nlips to his bloody forehead. \\n\\n“You said Greyback attacked him?” Mr. Weasley \\nasked Professor McGonagall distractedly. “But he \\nhadn’t transformed? So what does that mean? What \\nwill happen to Bill?” \\n\\n“We don’t yet know,” said Professor McGonagall, \\nlooking helplessly at Lupin. \\n\\n“There will probably be some contamination, Arthur,” \\nsaid Lupin. “It is an odd case, possibly unique. ... We \\ndon’t know what his behavior might be like when he \\nawakens. ...” \\n\\nMrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from \\nMadam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bill’s wounds. \\n\\n“And Dumbledore ...” said Mr. Weasley. “Minerva, is it \\ntrue ... Is he really ... ?” \\n\\nAs Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny \\nmove beside him and looked at her. Her slightly \\nnarrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing \\ndown at Bill with a frozen expression on her face. \\n\\n“Dumbledore gone,” whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. \\nWeasley had eyes only for her eldest son; she began \\nto sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated face. \\n\\n“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. ... It’s not \\nr-really important . . . but he was a very handsome \\nlittle b-boy . . . always very handsome . . . and he was g- \\ngoing to be married!” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 698 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly \\nand loudly. “What do you mean, ‘’e was going to be \\nmarried?’ ” \\n\\nMrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking \\nstartled. “Well — only that — ” \\n\\n“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?” \\ndemanded Fleur. “You theenk, because of these bites, \\nhe will not love me?” \\n\\n“No, that’s not what I — ” \\n\\n“Because ’e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her \\nfull height and throwing back her long mane of silver \\nhair. “It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill \\nloving me!” \\n\\n“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I \\nthought perhaps — given how — how he — ” \\n\\n“You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or \\nper’aps, you hoped?” said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. \\n“What do I care how he looks? I am good-looking \\nenough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show \\nis zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!” she \\nadded fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and \\nsnatching the ointment from her. \\n\\nMrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and \\nwatched Fleur mopping up Bill’s wounds with a most \\ncurious expression upon her face. Nobody said \\nanything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody \\nelse, he was waiting for the explosion. \\n\\n“Our Great-Auntie Muriel,” said Mrs. Weasley after a \\nlong pause, “has a very beautiful tiara — goblin-made \\n— which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 699 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, \\nand it would look lovely with your hair.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly. “I am sure zat will be \\nlovely.” \\n\\nAnd then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, \\nboth women were crying and hugging each other. \\nCompletely bewildered, wondering whether the world \\nhad gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as \\nstunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were \\nexchanging startled looks. \\n\\n“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at \\nLupin. “She still wants to marry him, even though \\nhe’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!” \\n\\n“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and \\nlooking suddenly tense. “Bill will not be a full \\nwerewolf. The cases are completely — ” \\n\\n“But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, \\nseizing the front of Lupin’s robes and shaking them. \\n“I’ve told you a million times. ...” \\n\\nAnd the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse- \\ncolored hair, and the reason she had come running to \\nfind Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor \\nsomeone had been attacked by Greyback, all \\nsuddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been \\nSirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all. \\n\\n“And I’ve told you a million times,” said Lupin, \\nrefusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, “that I \\nam too old for you, too poor ... too dangerous. ...” \\n\\n“I’ve said all along you’re taking a ridiculous line on \\nthis, Remus,” said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur’s shoulder \\nas she patted her on the back. \\n\\nPage | 700 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am not being ridiculous,” said Lupin steadily. \\n“Tonks deserves somebody young and whole.” \\n\\n“But she wants you,” said Mr. Weasley, with a small \\nsmile. “And after all, Remus, young and whole men do \\nnot necessarily remain so.” \\n\\nHe gestured sadly at his son, lying between them. \\n\\n“This is ... not the moment to discuss it,” said Lupin, \\navoiding everybody’s eyes as he looked around \\ndistractedly. “Dumbledore is dead. ...” \\n\\n“Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody \\nto think that there was a little more love in the world,” \\nsaid Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital \\ndoors opened again and Hagrid walked in. \\n\\nThe little of his face that was not obscured by hair or \\nbeard was soaking and swollen; he was shaking with \\ntears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in his hand. \\n\\n“I’ve ... I’ve done it, Professor,” he choked. “M-moved \\nhim. Professor Sprout’s got the kids back in bed. \\nProfessor Flitwick’s lyin’ down, but he says he’ll be all \\nrigh’ in a jiffy, an’ Professor Slughorn says the \\nMinistry’s bin informed.” \\n\\n“Thank you, Hagrid,” said Professor McGonagall, \\nstanding up at once and turning to look at the group \\naround Bill’s bed. “I shall have to see the Ministry \\nwhen they get here. Hagrid, please tell the Heads of \\nHouses — Slughorn can represent Slytherin — that I \\nwant to see them in my office forthwith. I would like \\nyou to join us too.” \\n\\nAs Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the \\nroom again, she looked down at Harry. “Before I meet \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 701 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthem I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If \\nyou’ll come with me. ...” \\n\\nHarry stood up, murmured “See you in a bit” to Ron, \\nHermione, and Ginny, and followed Professor \\nMcGonagall back down the ward. The corridors \\noutside were deserted and the only sound was the \\ndistant phoenix song. It was several minutes before \\nHarry became aware that they were not heading for \\nProfessor McGonagall’s office, but for Dumbledore’s, \\nand another few seconds before he realized that of \\ncourse, she had been deputy headmistress. ... \\nApparently she was now headmistress ... so the room \\nbehind the gargoyle was now hers. \\n\\nIn silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase \\nand entered the circular office. He did not know what \\nhe had expected: that the room would be draped in \\nblack, perhaps, or even that Dumbledore’s body \\nmight be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly \\nas it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it \\nmere hours previously: the silver instruments \\nwhirring and puffing on their spindle-legged tables, \\nGryffindor’s sword in its glass case gleaming in the \\nmoonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the \\ndesk. But Fawkes’s perch stood empty, he was still \\ncrying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait \\nhad joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and \\nheadmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was \\nslumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his half- \\nmoon spectacles perched upon his crooked nose, \\nlooking peaceful and untroubled. \\n\\nAfter glancing once at this portrait, Professor \\nMcGonagall made an odd movement as though \\nsteeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at \\nHarry, her face taut and lined. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 702 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Harry,” she said, “I would like to know what you and \\nProfessor Dumbledore were doing this evening when \\nyou left the school.” \\n\\n“I can’t tell you that, Professor,” said Harry. He had \\nexpected the question and had his answer ready. It \\nhad been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore \\nhad told him that he was to confide the contents of \\ntheir lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione. \\n\\n“Harry, it might be important,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall. \\n\\n“It is,” said Harry, “very, but he didn’t want me to tell \\nanyone.” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall glared at him. “Potter” — Harry \\nregistered the renewed use of his surname — “in the \\nlight of Professor Dumbledore’s death, I think you \\nmust see that the situation has changed somewhat — \\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging. “Professor \\nDumbledore never told me to stop following his orders \\nif he died.” \\n\\n“But — ” \\n\\n“There’s one thing you should know before the \\nMinistry gets here, though. Madam Rosmerta’s under \\nthe Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the \\nDeath Eaters, that’s how the necklace and the \\npoisoned mead — ” \\n\\n“Rosmerta?” said Professor McGonagall incredulously, \\nbut before she could go on, there was a knock on the \\ndoor behind them and Professors Sprout, Flitwick, \\nand Slughorn traipsed into the room, followed by \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 703 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid, who was still weeping copiously, his huge \\nframe trembling with grief. \\n\\n“Snape!” ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most \\nshaken, pale and sweating. “Snape! I taught him! I \\nthought I knew him!” \\n\\nBut before any of them could respond to this, a sharp \\nvoice spoke from high on the wall: A sallow-faced \\nwizard with a short black fringe had just walked back \\ninto his empty canvas. \\n\\n“Minerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he \\nhas just Disapparated from the Ministry.” \\n\\n“Thank you, Everard,” said Professor McGonagall, \\nand she turned quickly to her teachers. \\n\\n“I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts \\nbefore he gets here,” she said quickly. “Personally, I \\nam not convinced that the school should reopen next \\nyear. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one \\nof our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts ’s \\nhistory. It is horrible.” \\n\\n“I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school \\nto remain open,” said Professor Sprout. “I feel that if a \\nsingle pupil wants to come, then the school ought to \\nremain open for that pupil.” \\n\\n“But will we have a single pupil after this?” said \\nSlughorn, now dabbing his sweating brow with a \\nsilken handkerchief. “Parents will want to keep their \\nchildren at home and I can’t say I blame them. \\nPersonally, I don’t think we’re in more danger at \\nHogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you can’t \\nexpect mothers to think like that. They’ll want to keep \\ntheir families together, it’s only natural.” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 704 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I agree,” said Professor McGonagall. “And in any \\ncase, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never \\nenvisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. \\nWhen the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered \\nthe closure of the school — and I must say that \\nProfessor Dumbledore’s murder is more disturbing to \\nme than the idea of Slytherin’s monster living \\nundetected in the bowels of the castle. ...” \\n\\n“We must consult the governors,” said Professor \\nFlitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large \\nbruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise \\nunscathed by his collapse in Snape’s office. “We must \\nfollow the established procedures. A decision should \\nnot be made hastily.” \\n\\n“Hagrid, you haven’t said anything,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall. “What are your views, ought Hogwarts to \\nremain open?” \\n\\nHagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, \\nspotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, \\nnow raised puffy red eyes and croaked, “I dunno, \\nProfessor ... that’s fer the Heads of House an’ the \\nheadmistress ter decide ...” \\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,” \\nsaid Professor McGonagall kindly, “and so do I.” \\n\\n“Well, I’m stayin’,” said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking \\nout of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into \\nhis tangled beard. “It’s me home, it’s bin me home \\nsince I was thirteen. An’ if there’s kids who wan’ me \\nter teach ’em, I’ll do it. But ... I dunno ... Hogwarts \\nwithout Dumbledore ...” He gulped and disappeared \\nbehind his handkerchief once more, and there was \\nsilence. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 705 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out \\nof the window at the grounds, checking to see \\nwhether the Minister was yet approaching, “then I \\nmust agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to \\nconsult the governors, who will make the final \\ndecision. \\n\\n“Now, as to getting students home ... there is an \\nargument for doing it sooner rather than later. We \\ncould arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come \\ntomorrow if necessary — ” \\n\\n“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, \\nspeaking at last. \\n\\n“Well ...” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of \\nher briskness as her voice shook. “I — I know that it \\nwas Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest here, at \\nHogwarts — ” \\n\\n“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry \\nfiercely. \\n\\n“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor \\nMcGonagall. “No other headmaster or headmistress \\nhas ever been — ” \\n\\n“No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more \\nto this school,” growled Hagrid. \\n\\n“Hogwarts should be Dumbledore’s final resting \\nplace,” said Professor Flitwick. \\n\\n“Absolutely,” said Professor Sprout. \\n\\n“And in that case,” said Harry, “you shouldn’t send \\nthe students home until the funeral’s over. They’ll \\nwant to say — ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 706 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last word caught in his throat, but Professor \\nSprout completed the sentence for him. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Good-bye.” \\n\\n“Well said,” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “Well said \\nindeed! Our students should pay tribute, it is fitting. \\nWe can arrange transport home afterward.” \\n\\n“Seconded,” barked Professor Sprout. \\n\\n“I suppose ... yes ...” said Slughorn in a rather \\nagitated voice, while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of \\nassent. \\n\\n“He’s coming,” said Professor McGonagall suddenly, \\ngazing down into the grounds. “The Minister ... and \\nby the looks of it, he’s brought a delegation ...” \\n\\n“Can I leave, Professor?” said Harry at once. \\n\\nHe had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, \\nRufus Scrimgeour tonight. \\n\\n“You may,” said Professor McGonagall. “And quickly.” \\n\\nShe strode toward the door and held it open for him. \\nHe sped down the spiral staircase and off along the \\ndeserted corridor; he had left his Invisibility Cloak at \\nthe top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; \\nthere was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, \\nnot even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves. He did not \\nmeet another soul until he turned into the passage \\nleading to the Gryffindor common room. \\n\\n“Is it true?” whispered the Fat Lady as he approached \\nher. “It is really true? Dumbledore — dead?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. \\n\\nPage | 707 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe let out a wail and, without waiting for the \\npassword, swung forward to admit him. \\n\\n\\n\\nAs Harry had suspected it would be, the common \\nroom was jam-packed. The room fell silent as he \\nclimbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean and \\nSeamus sitting in a group nearby: This meant that \\nthe dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without \\nspeaking to anybody, without making eye contact at \\nall, Harry walked straight across the room and \\nthrough the door to the boys’ dormitories. \\n\\nAs he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully \\ndressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on his \\nown four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared \\nat each other. \\n\\n“They’re talking about closing the school,” said Harry. \\n“Lupin said they would,” said Ron. \\n\\nThere was a pause. \\n\\n“So?” said Ron in a very low voice, as though he \\nthought the furniture might be listening in. “Did you \\nfind one? Did you get it? A — a Horcrux?” \\n\\nHarry shook his head. All that had taken place \\naround that black lake seemed like an old nightmare \\nnow; had it really happened, and only hours ago? \\n\\n“You didn’t get it?” said Ron, looking crestfallen. “It \\nwasn’t there?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry. “Someone had already taken it and \\nleft a fake in its place.” \\n\\n“Already taken — ?” \\n\\nPage | 708 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his \\npocket, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full story \\ncould wait. ... It did not matter tonight ... nothing \\nmattered except the end, the end of their pointless \\nadventure, the end of Dumbledore’s life. ... \\n\\n“R.A.B.,” whispered Ron, “but who was that?” \\n\\n“Dunno,” said Harry, lying back on his bed fully \\nclothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt no \\ncuriosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that he \\nwould ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he \\nbecame aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. \\nFawkes had stopped singing. \\n\\nAnd he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that \\nthe phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just \\nas Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world \\n. . . had left Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 709 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WHITE TOMB \\n\\nAll lessons were suspended, all examinations \\npostponed. Some students were hurried away from \\nHogwarts by their parents over the next couple of \\ndays — the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on \\nthe morning following Dumbledore’s death, and \\nZacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his \\nhaughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the \\nother hand, refused point-blank to accompany his \\nmother home; they had a shouting match in the \\nentrance hall that was resolved when she agreed that \\nhe could remain behind for the funeral. She had \\ndifficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told \\nHarry and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring \\ninto the village, preparing to pay their last respects to \\nDumbledore. \\n\\nSome excitement was caused among the younger \\nstudents, who had never seen it before, when a \\npowder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a \\ndozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of \\nthe sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 710 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\nlanded on the edge of the forest. Harry watched from \\na window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, \\nblack-haired woman descended the carriage steps \\nand threw herself into the waiting Hagrid’s arms. \\nMeanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including \\nthe Minister of Magic himself, was being \\naccommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently \\navoiding contact with any of them; he was sure that, \\nsooner or later, he would be asked again to account \\nfor Dumbledore’s last excursion from Hogwarts. \\n\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were spending all \\nof their time together. The beautiful weather seemed \\nto mock them; Harry could imagine how it would have \\nbeen if Dumbledore had not died, and they had had \\nthis time together at the very end of the year, Ginny’s \\nexaminations finished, the pressure of homework \\nlifted . . . and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing \\nthat he knew he must say, doing what he knew was \\nright to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best \\nsource of comfort. \\n\\nThey visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had \\nbeen discharged, but Bill remained under Madam \\nPomfrey’s care. His scars were as bad as ever — in \\ntruth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye \\nMoody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs — \\nbut in personality he seemed just the same as ever. \\n\\nAll that appeared to have changed was that he now \\nhad a great liking for very rare steaks. \\n\\n\"... so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur \\nhappily, plumping up Bill’s pillows, “because ze \\nBritish overcook their meat, I ’ave always said this.” \\n\\n“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he \\nreally is going to marry her,” sighed Ginny later that \\nevening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat beside \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 711 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe open window of the Gryffindor common room, \\nlooking out over the twilit grounds. \\n\\n“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he \\nadded hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she \\nlet out a reluctant giggle. \\n\\n“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.” \\n\\n“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, \\nwho was perusing the Evening Prophet. \\n\\nHermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. \\n“No,” she said reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. \\n“They’re still looking for Snape but no sign ...” \\n\\n“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry \\nevery time this subject cropped up. “They won’t find \\nSnape till they find Voldemort, and seeing as they’ve \\nnever managed to do that in all this time ...” \\n\\n“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t \\nbeen sleeping that well since . . . well ... I could do with \\nsome sleep.” \\n\\nShe kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved \\nat the other two, and departed for the girls’ \\ndormitories. The moment the door had closed behind \\nher, Hermione leaned forward toward Harry with a \\nmost Hermione-ish look on her face. \\n\\n“Harry, I found something out this morning, in the \\nlibrary.” \\n\\n“R.A.B.?” said Harry, sitting up straight. \\n\\nHe did not feel the way he had so often felt before, \\nexcited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a \\nmystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering \\n\\nPage | 712 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed \\nbefore he could move a little farther along the dark \\nand winding path stretching ahead of him, the path \\nthat he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, \\nand which he now knew he would have to journey \\nalone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes \\nout there somewhere, and each would need to be \\nfound and eliminated before there was even a \\npossibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept \\nreciting their names to himself, as though by listing \\nthem he could bring them within reach: the locket ... \\nthe cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor’s or \\nRavenclaw’s . . . the locket . . . the cup . . . the snake . . . \\nsomething of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s ... \\n\\nThis mantra seemed to pulse through Harry’s mind as \\nhe fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with \\ncups, lockets, and mysterious objects that he could \\nnot quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered \\nHarry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the \\nmoment he began to climb. ... \\n\\nHe had shown Hermione the note inside the locket \\nthe morning after Dumbledore ’s death, and although \\nshe had not immediately recognized the initials as \\nbelonging to some obscure wizard about whom she \\nhad been reading, she had since been rushing off to \\nthe library a little more often than was strictly \\nnecessary for somebody who had no homework to do. \\n\\n“No,” she said sadly, “I’ve been trying, Harry, but I \\nhaven’t found anything. ... There are a couple of \\nreasonably well-known wizards with those initials — \\nRosalind Antigone Bungs . . . Rupert ‘Axebanger’ \\nBrookstanton ... but they don’t seem to fit at all. \\nJudging by that note, the person who stole the \\nHorcrux knew Voldemort, and I can’t find a shred of \\nevidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 713 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto do with him. ... No, actually, it’s about ... well, \\nSnape.” \\n\\nShe looked nervous even saying the name again. \\n\\n“What about him?” asked Harry heavily, slumping \\nback in his chair. \\n\\n“Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half- \\nBlood Prince business,” she said tentatively. \\n\\n“D’you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d’you think I \\nfeel about that now?” \\n\\n“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said \\nhastily, looking around to check that they were not \\nbeing overheard. “It’s just that I was right about \\nEileen Prince once owning the book. You see ... she \\nwas Snape ’s mother!” \\n\\n“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. \\nHermione ignored him. \\n\\n“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and \\nthere was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince \\nmarrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later \\nan announcement saying that she’d given birth to a \\n\\n\\n\\n“ — murderer,” spat Harry. \\n\\n“Well ... yes,” said Hermione. “So ... I was sort of \\nright. Snape must have been proud of being ‘half a \\nPrince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle from \\nwhat it said in the Prophet” \\n\\n“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure- \\nblood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and \\nthe rest of them. ... He’s just like Voldemort. Pure- \\n\\nPage | 714 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nblood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his \\nparentage, trying to make himself feared using the \\nDark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name — \\nLord Voldemort — the Half-Blood Prince — how could \\nDumbledore have missed — ?” \\n\\nHe broke off, looking out the window. He could not \\nstop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore ’s inexcusable \\ntrust in Snape ... but as Hermione had just \\ninadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been \\ntaken in just the same. ... In spite of the increasing \\nnastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to \\nbelieve ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had \\nhelped him so much. ... \\n\\nHelped him ... it was an almost unendurable thought \\nnow. \\n\\n“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using \\nthat book,” said Ron. “He must’ve known where you \\nwere getting it all from.” \\n\\n“He knew,” said Harry bitterly. “He knew when I used \\nSectumsempra. He didn’t really need Legilimency. ... \\nHe might even have known before then, with \\nSlughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions. \\n... Shouldn’t have left his old book in the bottom of \\nthat cupboard, should he?” \\n\\n“But why didn’t he turn you in?” \\n\\n“I don’t think he wanted to associate himself with that \\nbook,” said Hermione. “I don’t think Dumbledore \\nwould have liked it very much if he’d known. And \\neven if Snape pretended it hadn’t been his, Slughorn \\nwould have recognized his writing at once. Anyway, \\nthe book was left in Snape’s old classroom, and I’ll bet \\nDumbledore knew his mother was called ‘Prince.’ ” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 715 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I should’ve shown the book to Dumbledore,” said \\nHarry. “All that time he was showing me how \\nVoldemort was evil even when he was at school, and I \\nhad proof Snape was too — ” \\n\\n“ ‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said Hermione quietly. \\n\\n“You were the one who kept telling me the book was \\ndangerous!” \\n\\n“I’m trying to say, Harry, that you’re putting too much \\nblame on yourself. I thought the Prince seemed to \\nhave a nasty sense of humor, but I would never have \\nguessed he was a potential killer. ...” \\n\\n“None of us could’ve guessed Snape would ... you \\nknow,” said Ron. \\n\\nSilence fell between them, each of them lost in their \\nown thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, \\nwere thinking about the following morning, when \\nDumbledore’s body would be laid to rest. He had \\nnever attended a funeral before; there had been no \\nbody to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know \\nwhat to expect and was a little worried about what he \\nmight see, about how he would feel. He wondered \\nwhether Dumbledore’s death would be more real to \\nhim once it was over. Though he had moments when \\nthe horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, \\nthere were blank stretches of numbness where, \\ndespite the fact that nobody was talking about \\nanything else in the whole castle, he still found it \\ndifficult to believe that Dumbledore had really gone. \\nAdmittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked \\ndesperately for some kind of loophole, some way that \\nDumbledore would come back. . . . He felt in his pocket \\nfor the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now \\ncarried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 716 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas a reminder of what it had cost and what remained \\nstill to do. \\n\\nHarry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts \\nExpress would be leaving an hour after the funeral. \\nDownstairs, he found the mood in the Great Hall \\nsubdued. Everybody was wearing their dress robes \\nand no one seemed very hungry. Professor \\nMcGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle \\nof the staff table empty. Hagrid’s chair was deserted \\ntoo; Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able \\nto face breakfast, but Snape’s place had been \\nunceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry \\navoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; \\nHarry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour \\nwas looking for him. Among Scrimgeour’s entourage \\nHarry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses \\nof Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware \\nof Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with \\nunwonted venom. \\n\\nOver at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were \\nmuttering together. Hulking boys though they were, \\nthey looked oddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of \\nMalfoy between them, bossing them around. Harry \\nhad not spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity \\nwas all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in \\nMalfoy’s voice on that tower top, nor the fact that he \\nhad lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters \\narrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have \\nkilled Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his \\ninfatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest \\ndrop of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry \\nwondered, was Malfoy now, and what was Voldemort \\nmaking him do under threat of killing him and his \\nparents? \\n\\nHarry’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the \\nribs from Ginny. Professor McGonagall had risen to \\n\\nPage | 717 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nher feet, and the mournful hum in the Hall died away \\nat once. \\n\\n“It is nearly time,” she said. “Please follow your Heads \\nof Houses out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after \\nme.” \\n\\nThey filed out from behind their benches in near \\nsilence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the \\nSlytherin column, wearing magnificent, long, emerald \\ngreen robes embroidered with silver. He had never \\nseen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, \\nlooking so clean; there was not a single patch on her \\nhat, and when they reached the entrance hall, they \\nfound Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a \\nthick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient \\nblack suit and tie reeking of mothballs. \\n\\nThey were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped \\nout onto the stone steps from the front doors, toward \\nthe lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as \\nthey followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the \\nplace where hundreds of chairs had been set out in \\nrows. An aisle ran down the center of them: There \\nwas a marble table standing at the front, all chairs \\nfacing it. It was the most beautiful summer’s day. \\n\\nAn extraordinary assortment of people had already \\nsettled into half of the chairs; shabby and smart, old \\nand young. Most Harry did not recognize, but a few \\nhe did, including members of the Order of the \\nPhoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; \\nTonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest \\npink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be \\nholding hands; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported \\nby Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were \\nwearing jackets of black dragon skin. Then there was \\nMadame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs \\non her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron \\nPage | 718 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin London; Arabella Figg, Harry’s Squib neighbor; the \\nhairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird \\nSisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam \\nMalkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some \\npeople whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the \\nbarman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed \\nthe trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts \\nwere there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, \\ndiscernible only when they moved, shimmering \\ninsubstantially on the gleaming air. \\n\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at \\nthe end of a row beside the lake. People were \\nwhispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in \\nthe grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The \\ncrowd continued to swell; with a great rush of \\naffection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being \\nhelped into a seat by Luna. Neville and Luna alone of \\nthe D.A. had responded to Hermione ’s summons the \\nnight that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew \\nwhy: They were the ones who had missed the D.A. \\nmost . . . probably the ones who had checked their \\ncoins regularly in the hope that there would be \\nanother meeting. \\n\\nCornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, \\nhis expression miserable, twirling his green bowler \\nhat as usual; Harry next recognized Rita Skeeter, \\nwho, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook \\nclutched in her red-taloned hand, and then, with a \\nworse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing \\nexpression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black \\nvelvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls. At the sight \\nof the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a \\nsentinel near the water’s edge, she gave a start and \\nscurried hastily into a seat a good distance away. \\n\\nThe staff was seated at last. Harry could see \\nScrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front \\n\\nPage | 719 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrow with Professor McGonagall. He wondered whether \\nScrimgeour or any of these important people were \\nreally sorry that Dumbledore was dead. But then he \\nheard music, strange, otherworldly music, and he \\nforgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for \\nthe source of it. He was not the only one: Many heads \\nwere turning, searching, a little alarmed. \\n\\n“In there,” whispered Ginny in Harry’s ear. \\n\\nAnd he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, \\ninches below the surface, reminding him horribly of \\nthe Inferi: a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange \\nlanguage he did not understand, their pallid faces \\nrippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. \\nThe music made the hair on Harry’s neck stand up, \\nand yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of \\nloss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild \\nfaces of the singers, he had the feeling that they, at \\nleast, were sorry for Dumbledore’s passing. Then \\nGinny nudged him again and he looked around. \\n\\nHagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the \\nchairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming \\nwith tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet \\nspangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to \\nbe Dumbledore’s body. A sharp pain rose in Harry’s \\nthroat at this sight: For a moment, the strange music \\nand the knowledge that Dumbledore’s body was so \\nclose seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron \\nlooked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick \\nand fast into both Ginny ’s and Hermione’s laps. \\n\\nThey could not see clearly what was happening at the \\nfront. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body \\ncarefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the \\naisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises \\nthat drew scandalized looks from some, including, \\nHarry saw, Dolores Umbridge ... but Harry knew that \\nPage | 720 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a \\nfriendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid’s \\neyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see \\nwhere he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to \\nwhich Hagrid was heading and realized what was \\nguiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and \\ntrousers each the size of a small marquee, was the \\ngiant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, \\ndocile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his \\nhalf-brother, and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the \\nhead, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. \\nHarry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh. But \\nthen the music stopped, and he turned to face the \\nfront again. \\n\\nA little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got \\nto his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledore ’s \\nbody. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd \\nwords floated back to them over the hundreds of \\nheads. “Nobility of spirit” ... “intellectual contribution” \\n... “greatness of heart” ... It did not mean very much. \\n\\nIt had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had \\nknown him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore ’s \\nidea of a few words, “nitwit,” “oddment,” “blubber,” \\nand “tweak,” and again had to suppress a grin. ... \\nWhat was the matter with him? \\n\\nThere was a soft splashing noise to his left and he \\nsaw that the merpeople had broken the surface to \\nlisten too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at \\nthe water’s edge two years ago, very close to where \\nHarry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the \\nMerchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore \\nhad learned Mermish. There was so much he had \\nnever asked him, so much he should have said. ... \\n\\nAnd then, without warning, it swept over him, the \\ndreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than \\nit had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone. ... He \\n\\nPage | 721 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it \\nhurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from \\nhis eyes: He looked away from Ginny and the others \\nand stared out over the lake, toward the forest, as the \\nlittle man in black droned on. ... There was movement \\namong the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their \\nrespects too. They did not move into the open but \\nHarry saw them standing quite still, half hidden in \\nshadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at \\ntheir sides. And Harry remembered his first \\nnightmarish trip into the forest, the first time he had \\never encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, \\nand how he had faced him, and how he and \\nDumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not \\nlong thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to \\nfight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then \\ncould evil be kept at bay, though never quite \\neradicated. ... \\n\\nAnd Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the \\nhot sun how people who cared about him had stood \\nin front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his \\ngodfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to \\nprotect him; but now that was over. He could not let \\nanybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he \\nmust abandon forever the illusion he ought to have \\nlost at the age of one, that the shelter of a parent’s \\narms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was \\nno waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper \\nin the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in \\nhis imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors \\nhad died, and he was more alone than he had ever \\nbeen before. \\n\\nThe little man in black had stopped speaking at last \\nand resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else \\nto get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably \\nfrom the Minister, but nobody moved. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 722 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen several people screamed. Bright, white flames \\nhad erupted around Dumbledore’s body and the table \\nupon which it lay: Higher and higher they rose, \\nobscuring the body. White smoke spiraled into the air \\nand made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one \\nheart- stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly \\njoyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had \\nvanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, \\nencasing Dumbledore’s body and the table on which \\nhe had rested. \\n\\nThere were a few more cries of shock as a shower of \\narrows soared through the air, but they fell far short \\nof the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaurs’ \\ntribute: He saw them turn tail and disappear back \\ninto the cool trees. Likewise, the merpeople sank \\nslowly back into the green water and were lost from \\nview. \\n\\nHarry looked at Ginny, Ron, and Hermione: Ron’s \\nface was screwed up as though the sunlight were \\nblinding him. Hermione ’s face was glazed with tears, \\nbut Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry’s gaze \\nwith the same hard, blazing look that he had seen \\nwhen she had hugged him after winning the \\nQuidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at \\nthat moment they understood each other perfectly, \\nand that when he told her what he was going to do \\nnow, she would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,” \\nbut accept his decision, because she would not have \\nexpected anything less of him. And so he steeled \\nhimself to say what he had known he must say ever \\nsince Dumbledore had died. \\n\\n“Ginny, listen ...” he said very quietly, as the buzz of \\nconversation grew louder around them and people \\nbegan to get to their feet, “I can’t be involved with you \\nanymore. We’ve got to stop seeing each other. We \\ncan’t be together.” \\n\\nPage | 723 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe said, with an oddly twisted smile, “It’s for some \\nstupid, noble reason, isn’t it?” \\n\\n“It’s been like ... like something out of someone else’s \\nlife, these last few weeks with you,” said Harry. “But I \\ncan’t ... we can’t ... I’ve got things to do alone now.” \\n\\nShe did not cry, she simply looked at him. \\n\\n“Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He’s \\nalready used you as bait once, and that was just \\nbecause you’re my best friend’s sister. Think how \\nmuch danger you’ll be in if we keep this up. He’ll \\nknow, hell find out. He’ll try and get to me through \\nyou.” \\n\\n“What if I don’t care?” said Ginny fiercely. \\n\\n“I care,” said Harry. “How do you think I’d feel if this \\nwas your funeral ... and it was my fault. ...” \\n\\nShe looked away from him, over the lake. \\n\\n“I never really gave up on you,” she said. “Not really. I \\nalways hoped. ... Hermione told me to get on with life, \\nmaybe go out with some other people, relax a bit \\naround you, because I never used to be able to talk if \\nyou were in the room, remember? And she thought \\nyou might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more — \\nmyself.” \\n\\n“Smart girl, that Hermione,” said Harry, trying to \\nsmile. “I just wish I’d asked you sooner. We could’ve \\nhad ages ... months ... years maybe. ...” \\n\\n“But you’ve been too busy saving the Wizarding \\nworld,” said Ginny, half laughing. “Well ... I can’t say \\nI’m surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 724 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nknew you wouldn’t be happy unless you were hunting \\nVoldemort. Maybe that’s why I like you so much.” \\n\\nHarry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he \\nthink his resolution would hold if he remained sitting \\nbeside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione \\nand stroking her hair while she sobbed into his \\nshoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long \\nnose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned \\nhis back on Ginny and on Dumbledore’s tomb, and \\nwalked away around the lake. Moving felt much more \\nbearable than sitting still, just as setting out as soon \\nas possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill \\nVoldemort would feel better than waiting to do it. ... \\n\\n“Harry!” \\n\\nHe turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly \\ntoward him around the bank, leaning on his walking \\nstick. \\n\\n“I’ve been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if I \\nwalk a little way with you?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry indifferently, and set off again. \\n\\n“Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,” said Scrimgeour \\nquietly. “I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear \\nof it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our \\ndisagreements, as you know, but no one knows better \\nthan I — ” \\n\\n“What do you want?” asked Harry flatly. \\n\\nScrimgeour looked annoyed, but as before, hastily \\nmodified his expression to one of sorrowful \\nunderstanding. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 725 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are, of course, devastated,” he said. “I know that \\nyou were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may \\nhave been his favorite pupil ever. The bond between \\nthe two of you — ” \\n\\n“What do you want?” Harry repeated, coming to a \\nhalt. \\n\\nScrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick, and \\nstared at Harry, his expression shrewd now. \\n\\n“The word is that you were with him when he left the \\nschool the night that he died.” \\n\\n“Whose word?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the \\ntower after Dumbledore died. There were also two \\nbroomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and \\ntwo, Harry.” \\n\\n“Glad to hear it,” said Harry. “Well, where I went with \\nDumbledore and what we did is my business. He \\ndidn’t want people to know.” \\n\\n“Such loyalty is admirable, of course,” said \\nScrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his \\nirritation with difficulty, “but Dumbledore is gone, \\nHarry. He’s gone.” \\n\\n“He will only be gone from the school when none here \\nare loyal to him,” said Harry, smiling in spite of \\nhimself. \\n\\n“My dear boy . . . even Dumbledore cannot return from \\nthe — ” \\n\\n“I am not saying he can. You wouldn’t understand. \\n\\nBut I’ve got nothing to tell you.” \\n\\nPage | 726 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was \\nevidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy, “The \\nMinistry can offer you all sorts of protection, you \\nknow, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of \\nmy Aurors at your service — ” \\n\\nHarry laughed. “Voldemort wants to kill me himself, \\nand Aurors won’t stop him. So thanks for the offer, \\nbut no thanks.” \\n\\n“So,” said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, “the \\nrequest I made of you at Christmas — ” \\n\\n“What request? Oh yeah . . . the one where I tell the \\nworld what a great job you’re doing in exchange for — ” \\n\\n“ — for raising everyone’s morale!” snapped \\nScrimgeour. \\n\\nHarry considered him for a moment. \\n\\n“Released Stan Shunpike yet?” \\n\\nScrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly \\nreminiscent of Uncle Vernon. \\n\\n“I see you are — ” \\n\\n“Dumbledore’s man through and through,” said \\nHarry. “That’s right.” \\n\\nScrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then \\nturned and limped away without another word. Harry \\ncould see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation \\nwaiting for him, casting nervous glances at the \\nsobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their \\nseats. Ron and Hermione were hurrying toward \\nHarry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite \\ndirection. Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting \\nPage | 727 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor them to catch up, which they finally did in the \\nshade of a beech tree under which they had sat in \\nhappier times. \\n\\n“What did Scrimgeour want?” Hermione whispered. \\n\\n“Same as he wanted at Christmas,” shrugged Harry. \\n“Wanted me to give him inside information on \\nDumbledore and be the Ministry’s new poster boy.” \\n\\nRon seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, \\nthen he said loudly to Hermione, “Look, let me go \\nback and hit Percy!” \\n\\n“No,” she said firmly, grabbing his arm. \\n\\n“It’ll make me feel better!” \\n\\nHarry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, \\nthough her smile faded as she looked up at the castle. \\n\\n“I can’t bear the idea that we might never come back,” \\nshe said softly. “How can Hogwarts close?” \\n\\n“Maybe it won’t,” said Ron. “We’re not in any more \\ndanger here than we are at home, are we? \\nEverywhere’s the same now. I’d even say Hogwarts is \\nsafer, there are more wizards inside to defend the \\nplace. What d’you reckon, Harry?” \\n\\n“I’m not coming back even if it does reopen,” said \\nHarry. \\n\\nRon gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, “I knew \\nyou were going to say that. But then what will you \\ndo?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 728 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Tm going back to the Dursleys’ once more, because \\nDumbledore wanted me to,” said Harry. “But it’ll be a \\nshort visit, and then I’ll be gone for good.” \\n\\n“But where will you go if you don’t come back to \\nschool?” \\n\\n“I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow,” Harry \\nmuttered. He had had the idea in his head ever since \\nthe night of Dumbledore’s death. “For me, it started \\nthere, all of it. I’ve just got a feeling I need to go there. \\nAnd I can visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.” \\n\\n“And then what?” said Ron. \\n\\n“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, \\nhaven’t I?” said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledore’s \\nwhite tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of \\nthe lake. “That’s what he wanted me to do, that’s why \\nhe told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right — \\nand I’m sure he was — there are still four of them out \\nthere. I’ve got to find them and destroy them, and \\nthen I’ve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort’s \\nsoul, the bit that’s still in his body, and I’m the one \\nwho’s going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape \\nalong the way,” he added, “so much the better for me, \\nso much the worse for him.” \\n\\nThere was a long silence. The crowd had almost \\ndispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental \\nfigure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, \\nwhose howls of grief were still echoing across the \\nwater. \\n\\n“Well be there, Harry,” said Ron. \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 729 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“At your aunt and uncle’s house,” said Ron. “And \\nthen well go with you wherever you’re going.” \\n\\n“No — ” said Harry quickly; he had not counted on \\nthis, he had meant them to understand that he was \\nundertaking this most dangerous journey alone. \\n\\n“You said to us once before,” said Hermione quietly, \\n“that there was time to turn back if we wanted to. \\nWe’ve had time, haven’t we? \\n\\n“We’re with you whatever happens,” said Ron. “But \\nmate, you’re going to have to come round my mum \\nand dad’s house before we do anything else, even \\nGodric’s Hollow.” \\n\\n“Why?” \\n\\n“Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?” \\n\\nHarry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything \\nas normal as a wedding could still exist seemed \\nincredible and yet wonderful. \\n\\n“Yeah, we shouldn’t miss that,” he said finally. \\n\\nHis hand closed automatically around the fake \\nHorcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the \\ndark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for \\nhimself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort \\nhe knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, \\nor in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that \\nthere was still one last golden day of peace left to \\nenjoy with Ron and Hermione. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage | 730 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K.
