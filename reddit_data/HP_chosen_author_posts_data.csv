At this moment, Harry's indy rage suddenly dissipates, as it was only the affect of yet another potion that Daphne slipped him.

Everyone goes to Greengrass Manor to confront her only to find out her Ice Queen persona was you guessed it, the result of being potioned. The ""real"" Daphne is a laid back surfer chick (later revealed to be the result of yet another potion)

Confident!Neville takes charge to find the mastermind behind all this chaos but you can probably take a wild guess what happens.

I brought it up to a friend on Discord and they mentioned having seen *my* pseud being shared and insulted on a ship specific subreddit (This is a ship notorious for it's shippers toxicity)

- Olivia parts ways with 47 after this and doesn't return.

- Diana and 47 meet outside the mansion. Diana has risen quickly through the ranks of Providence and is now in the running to become the next Constant under Arthur Edwards.

- She plans to dismantle Providence from within once in power but will need 47 to help her 

- Targets are Don Yates (the vinyard owner and Diana's top rival for the position) and Tamara Vidal (the advisor to the Constant who could get in the way of Diana's plan)

- Diana is an NPC on the map and has VIP status (her death instantly ends the mission)

- Map is huge with many floors.

- Diana and 47 work together in the Mission Stories to set up the targets to kill them.

- Vidal is constantly following Diana

- One kill involves tricking Vidal into standing under a grape presser, allowing you to crush her into paste.

- The 'iconic' kill for the mission is 47 and Diana ambushing Yates just when he thinks he has won. Diana stabs Yates and taunts him as he lays dying about Providence's imminent destruction before having 47 shoot him in the head

- Diana is confronted by the Constant who presents her with the proof of 47 having assassinated her parents shocking her

- 47 and Olivia regroup in Berlin.

- They learn that the Constant has filed a hit on 47 with the ICA who have a team of their best agents descending on their location.

- Main mission is set at an illegal rave in an abandoned power plant.

- First target, Agent Price is patrolling the woods near the starting location. Insanely easy to kill.

- The rave is huge and looks awesome with tons of great disguises for 47 to use.

- Although there are plenty ICA agents, you only need to kill five for their mission to be aborted and an evacuation ordered.

- Main villain of the map and leader of the team is Agent Montgomery. I believe he has to die for the mission to succeed but don't quote me on that. 

- One Mission Story involves meeting Montgomery face-to-face which leads to a chance to kill the entire ICA team in one fell swoop.

- No Diana. 47 narrates all Mission Stories and Target Introductions himself.

- Olivia hacked the ICA and you can listen in on the agents, Montgomery and their handler, a woman named Jiao throughout the mission. 

- Another possible kill is the chance to shove an agent called Chanberlain from the top floor, smacking into the crowded dance floor.

- You can take over as DJ",,,1610904271

Context : Harry is an Auror trainee, patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade as part of a training exercise. He is partnered with Susan Bones and is bored out his mind

&gt; Harry sighed before he caught sight of two people moving towards them. The young woman with the turquoise sundress and tartan hat could have been no-one else but Luna Lovegood. She held a shopping list. It was six feet long and trailed behind her, occasionally tripping a passer-by. Next to her, his muscular arms laden with merchandise from shops already visited was a young man whose face was obscured by the bags and boxes he was holding in a precarious pile.

&gt; Luna immediately noticed Harry and gave an enthusiastic wave, skipping over with her companion stumbling behind, not knowing what the sudden rush was about. Up close, Luna’s eyes sparkled through hot pink sunglasses that clashed terribly with her hat.

&gt; ""Hello Harry. Hello Susan."" chirped Luna. Harry returned the greeting while Bones gave Luna the same look one would give a newly discovered breed of dog. ""We've been picking up some things for the paper. Colin has been such an immense help.""

&gt; With that, Luna's helper carefully set down what he was holding, revealing none other than Colin Creevey. At least, Harry was pretty sure it was the same Colin. The last time he had seen him, Colin had been a slim and baby-faced sixteen year old. This iteration was tall, broad-shouldered and had one of the squarest jaws Harry had ever seen.

&gt; Instead of Colin's usual mile-a-minute yammering, the man in front of them merely gave a nod of greeting. The idea of Colin Creevey being suave was an odd one to say the least.

&gt; ""Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go see a goblin about a printing press."" said Luna, bouncing off before anyone could process what she had said, leaving Harry with only Bones and Colin.

&gt; ""So, er, you're looking well Colin."" said Harry awkwardly, tapping his foot on the cobblestone.

&gt; ""Oh you really think so? "" cheered Colin with a bright grin and shining eyes. Evidently he hadn't changed that much after all. Bones sniggered. Colin took notice of himself and coughed several times before speaking again, his voice intentionally lowered.

&gt; ""Oh, you see I took up a Beater position in 7th year, really made a new man out of me. And after school, I've been doing odd jobs here and there - fixing up the Lovegoods' shed, fixing up the Lovegoods' weather vane, fixing up the Lovegoods'-""

&gt; ""So are you and her a thing? "" asked Bones, looking mildly exasperated.

&gt; Colin's face turned as red as an overcooked lobster as he began stammering and wringing his hands.

&gt; ""Well, you see, uh, not exactly, I have spent the night with her a few times, er, on the sofa I mean, not like in the same bed, but we are pretty close, she sent me a birthday card last June, er, uh, um.""

&gt; Colin's suffering was only relieved when Luna returned and his face immediately snapped back into suave mode. Luna peered at him with a quizzical look.

&gt; ""You're looking a bit flushed, Colin. Have you been trying the herbal bath regime I suggested? ""

&gt; ""Every night."" squeaked Colin, clearing his throat and trying to look as cool as possible.

&gt; ""No need to overdo it."" said Luna with a look of alarm. ""Come on, I need you to help move this.""

&gt; As Luna and her admirer left, Harry and Bones ducked into a side-street and collapsed into spasms of laughter.

gr3nytu,Bleepbloopbotz2,HPfanfiction,"Harry Potter was in pain.

Voldemort's siege on Hogwarts had been a disaster. The Death Eaters had been routed and slaughtered by Dumbledore's forces. Harry and the Dark Lord himself had both been captured and taken to the dungeons to await the inevitable destruction of all their Horcruxes.

He wanted to cry. He still remembered the look of hatred and fury on the faces of his former best friends as they dueled, defeating him with far less effort than Harry would ever admit. In a fit of childish pique, he had aligned himself with monsters and lost everything.

Students would occasionally come by his cell in the Hogwarts dungeons to ""give the Golden Boy a welcome back gift."" Harry's face often had a new bruise or welt by the time they left. The food they gave him was raw and the students would often throw it at him rather than hand it over.

The latest ""meal"" had been delivered to him by two girls - one with long, blonde hair wearing Ravenclaw robes and a the grimly smirking Ginny Weasley. 

""Wake up, Potter."" spat Ginny ""Can't have you dying just yet, you traitorous bastard."" Ginny's brother had not been to see Harry. Neither had Hermione. Seamus Finnegan had come and gone into extreme detail about Weasley and Granger's torid affair, following his abandonment of the light. They were having their ""own private victory celebration"" in the Gryffindor tower and seemed to have forgotten Harry existed, if Finnegan was telling the truth.

Ginny's companion set down a tray containing what looked like putrid gruel. It would be all Harry ate that day. Injustice burned in him. With Voldemort, he had been given feasts in the Malfoy and Greengrass manors. Now he was reduced to this.

""Filthy Mublood fucker.""  spat Harry. In a split-second, Ginny's boot had connected wirh his face. The tears came running down Harry's face as blood gushed from nose and teeth tumbled out of his mouth.

""Pathetic shit."" snarled Ginny ""Let's go Luna.""

Luna fixed the sobbing Death Eater with a look of pity.

Harry Potter | An Auror Prepper Error | T

Context : Auror trainee Harry is doing a training exercise in Hogsmeade. He is partnered with Susan Bones

&gt; The pair had spent the better part of the past hour, walking through the town square, making a note of terrible crimes, ranging from a dispute over change in Honeydukes to a group of children that were poking a sleeping Kneazle with a stick. People bustled everywhere, loudly talking about whatever business they had like there was an audience. Harry never understood why wizards had to be so dramatic about everything they did, the irony of thinking this following the past few weeks utterly lost on him.

&gt; ""Sooooo, are you doing anything later?"" asked Harry.

&gt; ""No."" said Bones bluntly not looking up from her notepad.

&gt; Harry sighed before he caught side of two people moving towards them. The young woman with the turquoise sundress and tartan hat could have been no-one else but Luna Lovegood. She held a shopping list. It was six feet long and trailed behind her, occasionally tripping a passer-by. Next to her, his muscular arms laden with merchandise from shops already visited was a young man whose face was obscured by the bags and boxes he was holding in a precarious pile.

&gt; Luna immediately noticed Harry and gave an enthusiastic wave, skipping over with her companion stumbling behind, not knowing what the sudden rush was about. As she drew closer, Harry saw that Luna was wearing hot pink tinted sunglasses which clashed terribly with her hat.

&gt; ""Hello Harry. Hello Susan."" chirped Luna. Harry returned the greeting while Bones gave Luna the same look one would give a newly discovered breed of dog. ""We've been picking up some things for the paper. Colin has been such an immense help.""

&gt; With that, Luna's helper carefully set down what he was holding, revealing none other than Colin Creevey. At least, Harry was pretty sure it was the same Colin. The last time he had seen him, Colin had been a slim and baby-faced sixteen year old. This iteration was tall, broad-shouldered and had one of the squarest jaws Harry had ever seen.

&gt; Instead of Colin's usual mile-a-minute yammering, the man in front of them merely gave a nod of greeting. The idea of Colin Creevey being suave was an odd one to say the least.

&gt; ""Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go see a goblin about a printing press."" said Luna, bouncing off before anyone could process what she had said, leaving Harry with only Bones and Colin.

&gt; ""So...er.... you're looking well Colin."" said Harry awkwardly.

&gt; ""Oh you really think so? "" cheered Colin with a bright grin and shining eyes. Evidently he hadn't changed that much after all. Bones sniggered. Colin took notice of himself and coughed several times before speaking again, his voice intentionally lowered.

&gt; ""Oh, you see I took up a Beater position in 7th year, really made a new man out of me. And after school, I've been doing odd jobs here and there - fixing up the Lovegoods' shed, fixing up the Lovegoods' weather vane, fixing up the Lovegoods'-""

&gt; ""So are you and her a thing? "" asked Bones, looking mildly exasperated.

&gt; Colin's face turned as red as an overcooked lobster as he began stammering and wringing his hands.

&gt; ""Well, you see..uh...not exactly....I have spent the night with her a few times.....er, on the sofa I mean..not like in the same bed...but we are pretty close..she sent me a birthday card last June.... er...uh...um.""

&gt; Colin's suffering was only relieved when Luna returned and his face immediately snapped back into suave mode. Luna peered at him with a quizzical look.

&gt; ""You're looking a bit flushed, Colin. Have you been trying the herbal bath regime I suggested? ""

&gt; ""Everynight."" squeaked Colin, trying to look as cool as possible.

&gt; ""No need to overdo it."" said Luna with a look of alarm. ""Come on, I need you to help move this.""

As Luna and her admirer left, Harry and Bones ducked into a side-street and collapsed into spasms of laughter.

""He wants to get in her pants so bloody much."" cackled Bones, looking the most humanlike she had been all day.",t3_m43rf3,t3_m43rf3,1615634409

gpgmwvg,Bleepbloopbotz2,HPfanfiction,"I think u/Faeriniel gave a pretty good answer to this

""I maintian that for the Fidelius Charm to work properly requires complete trust in another person. Additionally the person invested with that trust must reside somewhere else. Homes are important concepts in HP.

We know that spells have emotional or esoteric components, like for instance the Protronus Charm, and I feel it's in keeping with the world that the Fedlius would require a strong feeling of Trust.

So James and Lily could have chosen Dumbledore as their keeper, however they didn't know him nearly so well as they knew Sirius. So the effect would have been diminished if they had chosen the Headmaster.

When Bill mentions The Fidelius in DH:24 it seems clear in the text as written (Outside of authors intent) that the spell isn't working correctly.

Ron is able to both travel to Shell Cottage when he abandons the hunt, and recall it and communicate it to Dobby when they are at the Malfoy's. But if the spell was working propperly he'd have been unable to do so.

“Fidelius Charm. Dad’s Secret-Keeper. And we’ve done it on this cottage too; I’m Secret-Keeper here.""

In this same conversation Bill is able to divulge that the Weasley family are hiding at Muriel's and that Arthur is the Secret Keeper, which again should not be possible.

So that's my rational for the discrepency.""",t3_lwcvdc,t3_lwcvdc,1614720639

He writes to Mrs. Weasley to say that Harry wasn't expecting much for Christmas. While he certainly didn't expect her to send a sweater, we can reasonably assume he expected some sweets or perhaps some baked goods.

He repeatedly invites Harry and Hermione to the Burrow, and welcomes them with open arms.

He enlists Fred and George to help him rescue Harry from Privet Drive.

He makes Hagrid a cup of tea when Hagrid is most upset over the inquiry regarding Buckbeak, because it's what his mother does when someone is upset.

Ron holds stereotypical views of giants and werewolves and house elves, until he gets to know them on a one-on-one basis. He develops a friendship with Dobby, giving him a pair of socks and a sweater. This is in stark contrast Hermione, who stands on a soapbox and ignores what the house elves actually say.

Later, during the Battle of Hogwarts, it's Ron who remembers that the House Elves should be evacuated. ""We can't order them to die for us.""",t3_lk96un,t1_gnjlmke,1613405589

gnjipm4,Bleepbloopbotz2,harrypotter,"&gt; does that mean that everyone who was there and fought is skilled magically?

Yes ?",t3_lk96un,t1_gnjim3b,1613403198
gnjhbcc,Bleepbloopbotz2,harrypotter,"&gt; What does he do magically that makes him skilled? 

At the end of book 6 Harry notices him dueling an unknown Death Eater. The fact that Ron later appears unhurt later means that he must’ve won. We don’t know who this Death Eater is, but since Voldemort is a boss with high expectations I’d assume that he/she is at least stronger than the average wizard. Remember that this Death Eater, Lupin’s opponent, and Rowle all had to continue dueling the OotP and DA members while the others witnessed Dumbledore’s death.

When he was captured by Snatchers, he was able to steal the wand from one and use it to disarm another and escape before the others had time to react properly. Though less so than Death Eaters, the Snatchers were a dangerous group. Even though this squad was described as incompetent, Ron was still able to escape from 5–6 dark wizards.

His showings at the Malfoy Manor battle were pretty good too. First he disarmed the powerful Bellatrix Lestrange, albeit while catching her off guard. Still though, we know that Bellatrix isn’t just powerful but quick! He and Harry also were able to briefly defend against Draco, Narciassa, and Greyback before Bellatrix brought her knife to Hermione’s throat.

Probably his best moment was his (unfortunately offscreen) feats during the Battle of Seven Potters. While paired with Tonks, the two of them were able to hold off and escape from a bloodlusted and determined Bellatrix Lestrange, accompanied by Rodolphus Lestrange and probably at least one or two others. Despite the chaos the two successfully escaped from Lestrange unscathed, injured Rodolphus who is implied to be dangerous, and Ron even stunned a Death Eater to the face while moving quickly and erratically. Tonks even said that he performed spectacularly.

&gt; He didn’t “stand between.....fully willing to die.”

""If you want to get to Harry, you'll have to go through us""

gnj4upw,Bleepbloopbotz2,harrypotter,"They fight in book one, for about 5 minutes before coming friends.

They fight in book three, because hermione wouldn't admit that all the evidence suggested Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers.

She yells at him in book four, because he didn't ask her out, and when he did he fucked it up. Between then and he ball they are friendly, and even snowball fight together. At the ball they actually fight, but they are on speaking terms the next day, and while short, they don't spend much time being unfriendly.

They fight in book six because Hermione doesn't show her affection outwardly enough for Ron to notice it, and Ron is too preoccupied with being sorry with himself to notice Hermione asking him to the slug club dinner. Then Ron decides to kiss someone who actually shows her affection, and Hermione snaps with a bout of physical assault.

This is by far their longest fight, based completely on mistaken feelings and misinterpreted meanings. When the chips are down, Hermione relents from her self righteousness, coming to Ron hospital bed, and understanding better how they both messed up.

In book seven, Ron is influenced and manipulated by the horcrux to leave them, and Hermione is heartbroken. She doesnt stay mad at him for long, and she seems to be angry out of principle than emotion.

​

They spend a great deal of the series arguing, but suggesting that they spend more time arguing than playing, studying and laughing together is categorically false. They spend little over a few months in the seven years they've known each other not on speaking terms, which is clearly not more than the times they are speaking.

Hermione arrives at the burrow earlier than Harry many times during the summer holidays, spending weeks with Ron that we don't see. They also go on patrol together, studies Buckbeak's case together, Brew the Polyjuice potion together, and generally spend at shit ton of time together without Harry.

You clearly have read to much bad fanfiction, and I would suggest you re-read the series rather than using poorly characterized fanfic to base your opinions about Ron and Hermione.

gn76hb3,Bleepbloopbotz2,FanFiction,"Harry Potter / An Auror Prepper Error / T but could turn M

&gt; Look who's HERE !"" said Hermione loudly presenting Harry to the assorted redheads and guests assembled in the kitchen. Neither Ron nor the birthday boys were anywhere to be seen and Harry allowed Hermione and an equally giggly Ginny to led him around the house as his hand was shook and back slapped more times than he could count.

&gt; Charlie had eagerly shown him pictures of all the sanctuary's new baby dragons acting like a proud father at a ballet recital. Katie and Alicia were over the moon about the Holyhead Harpies' domination of the national league (Ginny let out a whoop that sounded more like a battle cry). Cho and Cedric were both looking as infuriatingly attractive as ever, engagement rings sparkling on their fingers.

&gt; Harry was sitting down down with Fleur (whose baby bump seemed to get larger whenever he looked away from it) and Bill (hearing the man he had considered the Epitome Of Cool when he was younger fret about child-proofing and daycare options was quite frankly an unnerving experience) when the door opened again and the sounds of several people bustling in was heard.

&gt; Harry turned his head and his stomach did cartwheels worthy of a circus as the bloke from the dream he had last Saturday that had necessitated changing his bedsheets walked in. Ron was holding Teddy Lupin in his arms as the boy's parents and the two men of the hour walked in to thunderous and mildly drunken applause.

&gt; Tonks did a mock bow before sliding over to coo over Fleur and pitch baby names that were soundly ignored as many of them were the stagenames of rockstars. Lupin nodded at Harry whose heart swelled, his favourite teacher noticing him still felt like an achievement despite being godfather of the man's son.

&gt; The twins meanwhile cracked jokes a mile a minute as they mingled with their party guests, jokingly begging Cedric not to evict their shop for complimenting his fiancee as Molly rolled her eyes although she couldn't hide her smile. Hermione and Ginny had Ron's full attention at the moment as the three of them laughed merrily as they got caught up while Ron bounced Teddy on his shoulders.

&gt; Teddy giggled as he softly tugged Ron's hair like a cowboy steering his horse. Teddy then scrunched up his face and puffed out his cheeks as slowly but surely his own hair turned red to match Ron's. Tonks did a rather un-Tonkslike squeal, conjuring up a camera with which to capture her son's Metamorphing.",t3_liy63w,t3_liy63w,1613218876

° Convoluted reasons for Harry to somehow meet Hermione before Hogwarts.

° Friendly goblins

° Daphne (she would be # AllLivesMatter let's be real)

° Every Ravenclaw bullying Luna, always led by Cho and Marietta

° 'It's not bashing, it's how they are in canon !'

° Neville replacing Ron and basically being the same person with flaws removed.

° Comically over the top Dursley abuse. Like the ones where they eat Hedwig for Christmas dinner.

° Slytherins getting praised by the narrative for nothing

° Magical cores.

° Weasley bashing in general

° Using characters as your mouthpieces

° Luna being a flawless goddess

° Greg, Vince and Millie

° ""ZOMG Ginny looks just like your mom !""

° Dumbledore/Weasleys/whoever the author doesn't like getting enslaved for life in Gringotts life as punishment for being so EEEEVVVILLLEEEEE. Usually ends with a dragon shitting on them.

° First Year study club.

° Harry having an all-caps temper tantrum every other chapter, where he complains about how shit his life is, and then proceeds to insult everyone in the room, and then leaves without any repercussions.

° Justin Finch-Fletchely eventually walked away from his family's money and became Muggle Studies professor and marries Susan Bones. They have one daughter named Amelia who eventually married Albus

° Seamus was a longtime bachelor until accidentally getting Sally-Anne Perks pregnant on New Year's Eve. Their son is named Colin and is Lily Luna' best friend

° Ernie Macmillan left the wizarding world behind and married a Muggle. He wrote a best-selling fantasy novel series about a heroic young man named Cedric Huffle. 

° Michael Corner was the result of a one night stand between a Muggle nurse and pro Quidditch player David Jones. This makes him cousins with Megan and Gwenog Jones. He eventually became an administrator at St.Mungo's while his wife Padma is Charms Mistress . They have their own twins in Rose and Albus's year who David adores

° Katie became the Holyhead Harpie's manager and married Alicia. Their wedding was on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch. They adopted several war orphans and made them Quidditch crazy . Oliver is their unofficial uncle . He never married and eventually replaced Madam Hooch

° Dennis went through a very rough time following the death of his brother but eventually pulled himself together and became a Daily Prophet journalist . He married Rionach O Neal (movie only character)

° Anthony Goldstein married a Muggle and had a son . He became an Auror and is Seamus's partner. They're like the Latino cops from Bad Boys

° Marietta's scars eventually faded. She married her old friend Roger and had a daughter. Hermione forgave her after a few years and they now drink coffee together and gossip when they have the opportunity

gicaaqz,Bleepbloopbotz2,boxoffice,"&gt; EXCLUSIVE: Paramount Pictures has acquired Spamalot, and the studio will be the one to mount a movie production based on the hit Broadway musical.

'The project comes to Paramount from Fox, where both chairman/CEO Jim Gianopulos and Motion Pictures Group president Emma Watts were when it landed there. The film lost steam when Disney acquired Fox. The good news is the picture is fully developed, with a screenplay by Monty Python troupe member Eric Idle, with songs by Idle and John DuPrez. The director is Casey Nicholaw, who was the choreographer of the original Broadway production. He has worked on this project awhile, and in the interim has become the hottest director and choreographer on Broadway. His credits include Book of Mormon, Aladdin, Mean Girls, The Prom, The Drowsy Chaperone and Something Rotten!

The film will be produced by Dan Jinks (American Beauty and Big Fish), and Idle.

Jon Gonda and Mike Ireland are the execs on the project for Paramount. The plan is to move right to casting and get underway this year.

The comedy is an adaptation of the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which despite grossing just $1.9 million, is considered a seminal comic film. The Broadway transfer was a huge hit, winning the Tony for Best Musical and one for its director, the late Mike Nichols. Nicholaw choreographed the original musical, which went on to do strong business on stages around the world.

Like the movie, the musical tackles the legend of King Arthur, with full tongue in cheek from the movie, and features many indelible moments from the Python film directed by Python members Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, including The Knights Of Ni, the sickly Not Dead Fred, who refuses a ride in the cart reserved for deceased plague victims, to the Black Knight whose arms and legs are cut off by King Arthur (‘it’s just a flesh wound”), and the Killer Rabbit, and the Holy Hand Grenade unleashed to thwart the murderous bunny.'",t3_krw8b1,t3_krw8b1,1609964423

m2zgev,PeevesPoltergist,lgbt,"[Spoilers] Extract from 'Heroes of Olympus' by Rick Riordan'Nico’s voice was like broken glass. ‘I – I wasn’t in love with Annabeth.’ ‘You were jealous of her,’ Jason said. ‘That’s why you didn’t want to be around her. Especially why you didn’t want to be around … him. It makes total sense.’ All the fight and denial seemed to go out of Nico at once. The darkness subsided. The Roman dead collapsed into bones and crumbled to dust. ‘I hated myself,’ Nico said. ‘I hated Percy Jackson.’ Cupid became visible – a lean, muscular young man with snowy white wings, straight black hair, a simple white frock and jeans. The bow and quiver slung over his shoulder were no toys – they were weapons of war. His eyes were as red as blood, as if every valentine in the world had been squeezed dry, distilled into one poisonous mixture. His face was handsome, but also harsh – as difficult to look at as a spotlight. He watched Nico with satisfaction, as if he’d identified the exact spot for his next arrow to make a clean kill. ‘I had a crush on Percy,’ Nico spat. ‘That’s the truth. That’s the big secret.’ He glared at Cupid. ‘Happy now?’ For the first time, Cupid’s gaze seemed sympathetic. ‘Oh, I wouldn’t say Love always makes you happy.’ His voice sounded smaller, much more human. ‘Sometimes it makes you incredibly sad. But at least you’ve faced it now. That’s the only way to conquer me.’ Cupid dissolved into the wind. On the ground where he’d stood lay an ivory staff three feet long, topped with a dark globe of polished marble about the size of a baseball, nestled on the backs of three gold Roman eagles. The sceptre of Diocletian. Nico knelt and picked it up. He regarded Jason, as if waiting for an attack. ‘If the others found out –’ ‘If the others found out,’ Jason said, ‘you’d have that many more people to back you up and to unleash the fury of the gods on anybody who gives you trouble.’ Nico scowled. Jason still felt the resentment and anger rippling off him. ‘But it’s your call,’ Jason added. ‘Your decision to share or not. I can only tell you –’ ‘I don’t feel that way any more,’ Nico muttered. ‘I mean … I gave up on Percy. I was young and impressionable, and I – I don’t …’ His voice cracked, and Jason could tell the guy was about to get teary-eyed. Whether Nico had really given up on Percy or not, Jason couldn’t imagine what it had been like for Nico all those years, keeping a secret that would’ve been unthinkable to share in the 1940s, denying who he was, feeling completely alone – even more isolated than other demigods. ‘Nico,’ he said gently, ‘I’ve seen a lot of brave things. But what you just did? That was maybe the bravest.’",,,1615493212

Were told from the first book that centaurs follow the stars and don't get involved in human affairs.

However I was reading PS again and it made me think. Bane and Ronan were angry with Firenze for rescuing Harry in the forest. Stopping Voldemort harming Harry. I wonder if they saw in the stars that Voldemort would kill Harry and it would lead to Voldemorts death.

Prophecies can happen immediately or years after they are made. I wonder if the centaurs were waiting for Harry's death before taking action because they knew it had to happen before Voldemort could be defeated?",,,1611831823

l4ec3c,PeevesPoltergist,harrypotter,"I wrote a little Fanfic if anyone wants to read it.Dudley paced the living room. He knew what he had to do but like all the other times he'd thought about doing it, something stopped him. Flashes from his childhood or the faces of his mother or father. He looked again at the phone and the number he'd put beside it. He heard his wife in the kitchen and the disbelieving mutterings that were emitting from there. His daughter stood in silence, still in her pajamas. She was as shocked and confused as her mother was. Neither of them knew what had happened but Dudley did, Dudley knew exactly what had happened and he even understood why it had happened but that didn't make it easier to deal with. He didn't want this for his little girl. 

He remembered the moment in the hospital after 20 hours of watching his wife entire pain and contractions, not knowing how to help or what he was supposed to do, the doctor handed him a soft, pink blanket with a small baby girl wrapped up inside it. He was so nervous he barely moved as he held her to his chest. Two years later she got glasses and Dudley couldn't help but think about all the times he'd broken Harry's glasses and couldn't believe the guilt he'd felt in that moment. He'd had a lot of times in his adult life where the things he'd done to his cousin came back to haunt him. His daughter, so sweet and innocent brought out the very best in him but with it a lot of regret and discomfort. 

When he was younger his behaviour was encouraged. Dudley had thought nothing of the fact that his father told him to hit his cousin or that he'd never been stopped from pinching, poking or punching his cousin. For 12 years Dudley had, had the run of the house and thought nothing of the treatment that Harry was subjected to. It wasn't until Harry came back from his 4th year at 'that school' that Dudley had began to wonder about his cousin. In all the years of torment, neglect and abuse, it wasn't til that year that Dudley noticed a difference, a change in Harry. 

That first night that Harry had come home from his school, he'd looked sick and sleepy. He'd gone to bed early which wasn't unusual, he didn't like being around the rest of the family more than was necessary but Dudley had been awake later than his parents that night. He was playing his computer games since most of that day had been taken up with boxing practice in the morning and driving to London to pick up Harry. Dudley was therefore the only one in the house to hear Harry's nightmares. To hear Harry call out for his parents and to beg unknown people not to kill another unknown person. Dudley never gave much thought to Harry's school life or the things that happened when Harry was away. Dudley knew Harry had friends at that other school and from what he'd seen at the train station, a great deal of other students seemed to like or respect Harry. Dudley had wondered at the time what his mother would do if it was him screaming out to the night like that and for the first time in his life felt a twinge of sadness for his cousin, knowing the level of comfort and support he (Dudley) received from his parents that Harry had and never would experience. Dudley lay awake that night wondering what actually happened at Harry's school and listening as the nightmare continued to consume his cousin. He'd never admit it to his parents but that night marked a change in Dudley, an awakening of sorts about the way his cousin acted and was treated whilst he stayed at Privet Drive. 

Over the next couple of years, aided by the horrible things he'd felt due to the dementors, he made attempts to reconcile with his cousin but Harry seemed more and more isolated from that point on. When he came home from his 5th year he didn't speak to any of them and stopped appearing for meal times. Then one night they came home and Harry had gone, a note left for his parents and that was it. The 6th year Harry was home for 2 weeks and then that adult wizard had come and taken Harry away with him. Dudley had never experienced a magical 'presence' around Harry, as such, he'd always felt defensive around his cousin but almost never fearful. The grown adult that had collected Harry was scary, his 'presence' made an almost visible atmosphere in the room and Dudley felt afraid and judged by this strange wizard. He'd almost wanted to stop his cousin leaving with this man. Was this man the reason that his cousin was always in pain? 

The year the Dursleys spent in hiding was the year Dudley learnt the most about his cousin and to an extent his mother. He'd known that his Auntie Lily was a witch and that her and her husband had been killed by a bad wizard but he hadn't realised that it was unusual for one sister to be born with powers and the other sister to have none. He hadn't thought about how it must have felt for his mum to watch her little sister disappear off to a school that she wasn't allowed to know anything about and come back home full of Secrets and knowledge that his mum would never be able to know or understand. He spent more time than his parents were happy with speaking to Hestia. Dedalus was a little too excitable for Dudley but Hestia was smart and was good at explaining things in a way that allowed Dudley to understand what she meant even if he didn't know all of the words she used. 

During their hiding his parents tried to act as normal as possible. His mum spent a lot of her time in the garden, pulling out weeds and sorting out the grass whilst his dad washed the car and read newspapers that he pretended weren't delivered by owls. The newspapers were weird that year. The papers his father read talked of natural disasters and freak weather fronts, whereas the papers Hestia and Dedalus read were full of death and destruction. Whilst his parents occupied themselves pretending everything was normal, Dudley spent his time between boxing, video games and learning about his cousins life. 

Dudley now understood that between school times Harry could do magic if he absolutely had to but he wasn't supposed to. Dudley was greatful for this and knew it was the reason he hadn't been cursed, jinxed or hexed once Harry had learnt how but it was also how Harry had managed to save his life when they were 15. Dudley had, had to explain that his fear of Magic was passed to him from his parents who had always treated Harry like an unexploded bomb and taught Dudley from a young age that Harry was dangerous and the only way to stop bad things happening was to always be in control and stronger than Harry. It seemed really stupid to him after watching Dedelus and Hestia fix broken things with magic, make things they needed appear and once, secretly Dudley had taken a potion Hestia had made to help him recover from the flu. He'd had to explain that his first ever, known, encounter with magic had left him with a pigs tail, then a blown up auntie, an overly expanding tongue, a run in with Dementors (Hestia had shuddered at this and put a warm hand on Dudley's shoulder in comfort and support of that situation) and finally being bashed over the head with a glass of unknown alcohol. For Dudley magic was bad and scary. It was something more powerful than him that could be used against him but living with grown wizards he was forced to admit that magic was useful, handy and at times life saving. 

He'd had to admit that he knew virtually nothing about his cousins life or why he (Harry) was so important. Hestia had, had to explain all about how Harry and Voldemort were connected and the suspicion that Harry was the only one who could kill this bad wizard. How Harry had nearly been killed several times whilst at school and about all the terrible things Harry had witnessed in his 6 years there. Dudley hadn't known it until then but Harry was stronger than him, perhaps not physically but mentally and emotionally, Harry was far superior. 

They'd been in hiding just less than a year when when a silver Lynx had appeared in the middle of the living room. Petunia had squeaked but fell silent when the Lynx had spoken. It said two sentences 

""Voldemort is dead"" 

""The war is over"" 

It would be another couple of weeks before they would be allowed to leave their hiding place but it would be another couple of years before Dudley saw Harry again. Dudley wrote to Harry when the war was over, Hestia had given him an address to write letters to in a parting package she'd given him. It wasn't where Harry lived but it was somewhere that Harry would receive mail from. They wrote letters back and forth over the next couple of years keeping each other informed of new developments in their lives. Dudley tried to explain in the letters how he know felt towards his cousin and all the things he'd learnt and now understood but he wasn't good with words. So the letters were stiff and semi - formal like a summer report that school asked you to do. 

When Harry wrote to Dudley to to tell him he was getting married Dudley's answering letter contained news of him proposing to his girlfriend. For two very different boys their adulthood panned out quite similarly. They attended each others weddings but it was tense and slightly uncomfortable. Dudley especially felt very out of place at a wedding where noone except two of the bridges brothers and her dad knew who he was and the floating food and drinks didn't really help either. 

They had exchanged numbers with each other when both of their wives had gotten pregnant within months of each other. Dudley, however had never used the number. It was much more comfortable to continue writing letters, even in an age of mobile phones and texting, Dudley still wrote and sent letters to Harry. It just seemed easier somehow but this couldn't be done in a letter he would need to bite the bullet and phone his cousin. 

Dudley took a deep breath and dialled the number. 

Harry jamp as the house phone rang. He looked at the device suspiciously. Only two people had the number, Hermione's parents and Dudley and Jean and Hugo had only been here yesterday so if it was them then something was wrong but Harry's gut said it wasn't them. His gut said it was Dudley, he didn't know what made him so sure but he felt no surprise when he picked up the phone and said hello and it was his older cousin who said a shaky hello in response. Harry had given the number to Dudley to be polite. He'd never actually expected him to call. They exchanged letters every 6 months or so and as far as Harry was concerned that was plenty. Nevertheless Harry inquired after Dudley's and his families health.

Originally Dudley said he was fine then he changed his mind, then he changed his mind again. 

""something's happened"" 

Dudley blurted out. Harry wondered if it was a health issue with his Aunt or Uncle and briefly wondered if he cared and why Dudley would think he *would* care. This thought was cut short when Dudley said it was his daughter. Dudley's daughter was ages with James so she'd be about 7 and suddenly Harry knew what his cousin was going to say before he said it. 

""She's done magic hasn't she?"" 

Harry asked without needing the answer. The deep, concerned breathing on the other end of the line was all the confirmation he needed. 

""She did what you did"" 

Dudley stumbled through a story about his daughter getting chewing gum stuck in her hair and his wife having to cut her waist length hair back up to her shoulders. The girl had panicked when the gum had gotten stuck and in her haste to get it out tangled more hair into it. The only solution had been to cut it out. His wife and daughter were both distraught until this morning when his daughter had woken up and her hair had grown back overnight. 

Harry remembered his own version of this all too well even after all these years. He could understand Dudley's concern. A child raised to fear and vilify magic now had a witch under his roof, his very own daughter. Harry almost felt sorry for his cousin and filled with a desire to help his niece, he invited his cousin to his house. Harry concluded the call after making some arrangements with Dudley and turned back to stare into the fireplace. 

""How in the name of Merlin am I going to explain this to Ginny?"" Harry asked of no one in particular.",,,1611543395

ktvv2z,PeevesPoltergist,AnimalCrossing,"The sell value of things?So I'm still really new to this game. I've been playing about 2 months and I have some questions about re/sell values.

Is it better to sell items all at once or as individual items?

Is there a way to find out how much something 'should' be worth?

Why did 4 wasps get me 10,000 bells but 10 wasp nests only got me 3,000 bells?

Is there any items that have a really high value that are easy to come across?

kt11bz,PeevesPoltergist,lgbt,"A question for the AllysI was asked recently when I became an Ally or what made me want to share information and help the LBTQ+ community. I realised I hadn't thought about the exact moment that, that happened in a long time and it led me to wonder what motivated other Allys to take up the fight?

I shall share me story but it will have trigger warnings for some.

When I was 6 I had to live with my grandparents for a while due to a family illness. During that time I got to see my favourite cousin daily. He was 13 and wanted to be a vet. He showed me how to hand feed birds and taught me what to do to get butterflies to land on my finger. He was and is one of the Kindest and most generous people I've ever met.

One afternoon he came home from school early about 1 O clock instead of 4. He was bleeding from his eye, nose and mouth. He had major bruises on his face and his hand was at a funny angle. It scared me and I cried. One of his teachers had driven him to my grandparents house and explained that 6 boys had beaten him up because they had found out he was gay.

My cousin didn't go back to school for the rest of my stay with my grandparents and we hung out everyday but he was different. He suddenly looked scared of the world. He explained to me what gay was and why it had resulted in those beating him up but I didn't understand.

What difference did it make if he liked boys or girls he was a good person and I told him so. He smiled and said he wished more people thought like I did. So I decided to make people see it that way. It was an overly simplistic world view but I went to school and drew posters and asked the teacher, in class, about gay people. That was my beginning in the world of LGBT+ and sometimes I look back and wonder how much has really changed and other times I feel proud of the steps forward since that moment but there's still so much to learn and so much to do.

I do feel hopeful in the knowledge that our current generation of better informed Allys are passing on the fight to and even better informed generation. My hope lays in the future.",,,1610106916

So at age 6 when I came home from the park and told my mum I'd fallen, she didn't think much of it. She checked me oven but the cut on my check was the biggest ""owie"" I had. I didn't sleep well that night and got up and dressed without looking at what I was doing. Went to school and and for the first 2 hours everything was OK. Then after break time we had P.E and I had to get changed, except I couldn't get my jumper off. Over the course of the morning my left arm had swollen up and I couldn't get my jumper off. They phoned my mum who came to get me. She cut my school jumper off me to discover my left arm was blue and purple and about four times the size it should be. Turns out I'd broken it in 2 places and I was so used to injuring myself that I just hadn't noticed.

How in the world did they do this? Well in medieval times the way they made pie crusts was a little different than in present time. The crust was thick, and could be baked first, and would rise forming a pot, hence the term ""pot pie.""

Sally doesn't seem like a very nice friend, if I'm being honest and Tim doesn't sound much better.

I guess the real question is, since this is a fund for him to get a ticket what happens if he doesn't actually use the money to buy a ticket? Or if you all buy the ticket what happens if he arrives and doesn't actually want to meet any of you?

The problem with the Internet is you can't be 100% sure of who someone else is or what their intentions might be.

You are correct to be annoyed at the suggestion of selling something that means something to you but if Sally has decided she really wants to meet this guy I'm not sure you'll be able to reason with her.

Will what your ex family have to say hurt more than not saying goodbye to someone that supported you or is there something you can do in your own way to say goodbye to her without attending the funeral if you decide not to go.

For decisions like this I try to think about the future. We don't know what our futures hold and what could change. If by some possibility your ex family starts to talk to you again in the future will you regret not going to the funeral?

Sadly it's really only something you can decide because only you have any real idea about what your ex family might say or do if you turn up.

Set yourself some realistic goals (I want to score one more point than I did last time) rather than thinking about passing or failing and don't be scared to ask for help. Even if a teacher has explained it to you before, ask again. My mum used to tell me ""it's better to look a fool for 5 minutes than be an idiot the rest of your life"" it sounds harsher than its meant but when I'm struggling and need to ask for help it's the phrase that pushes me forward.

Maybe try learning the maths that's associated with the things you enjoy so that maths helps you achieve the outcome you want. That way you can see maths in a more positive light and make it more fun for yourself.",t3_l6tehr,t3_l6tehr,1611836621

gkgk9jq,PeevesPoltergist,Advice,"So basically there's a point at which emotions crossover. One of the most common emotional switches is concern to anger. Your mum couldn't reach you so regardless of the fact that you were sleeping and that was probably the most logical answer your mum is hardwired to worry about you. Here's a short selection of the thoughts that go through her mind when you don't answer the phone (not that it was your fault I'm just showing you the flip side)

. Are they OK?

. Are they still asleep? Are they depressed? Do they need a doctor? How do I discuss depression with them?

. Have they gone out and left their phone at home?

. Are they in trouble?

. Do they need help and feel like they can't ask?

So then you would have plugged your phone in and answered your mum and she is relieved but concern switches to anger. Why not plug your phone in and answer so she didn't have to worry. So she snaps and gets angry but she now knows you've been sleeping all day and thus haven't eaten so she wants to make sure you've got food. The 'I don't know' answer annoys her because she wants to buy something you'll eat, the donuts and chicken answer gives her relief but sparks the concern again because that's what you want after not eating all day and she's worried (and still angry) about not being able to get you what you want.

I know it all comes of a little weird but she loves you and she's trying to do her best but the older you get the less control she has so the more worry, stress and anger you cause her. It's not intentional on either side it's just the way people grow up.

As for the concern about his feelings you could say something like

""Hay I know this is a bit random and I get that you probably don't feel the same way but I like you as more than a friend and it's time to tell you, so now you know""

It comes across as awkward and sometimes shy but your telling him how you feel and giving him a 'get out' if he doesn't feel the same.

If he says he doesn't feel the same, ask if you can still be friends and say

My dog eats dry food. We've given him wet food and food with gravy etc he won't touch it. However every day he takes one biscuit at a time and drops it into his water bowl and goes fishing for it. He blows bubbles the whole time. He gets the biscuit out. Eats it and then gets a fresh biscuit to do it again. He does this with about 10 biscuits before he eats his food normally.",t3_kp87n2,t3_kp87n2,1609661538

ltu6yb,SirAren,pokemon,"My Pokémon JourneyToday is the 25th anniversary of our &amp; my favorite franchise and this is to sump up in the best way.
Ok i have time so let's go through my journey as a Pokemon fan it's gonna be long but interesting

First I was introduced with pokemon with anime, pikachu was so cute with Ash and them travelling to see new wonders everyday. It was so cool I loved the seasons, May, Dawn, Brock all are so good, I loved the sinnoh anime and hoenn anime, 

My favorite memory however were the movies Rise Of Darkrai, Lucario and the mystery of mew and jirachi movie, although right now I think jirachi movie hasn't aged the best but I like it anyway
But The Lucario movie is soo good, the ending is best, it's perfect &amp; I became an all time fan because of that single film. Rise Of Darkrai was awesome too, Dialga Palkia fighting and Brilliant Oracion music it's so good also Lucario movie had awesome soundtrack too.



Then I actually didn't watch pokemon for like 2 or 3 years &amp; Completely forgot about it but then I did and omg I loved the original series with Ash it wasn't perfect but it had perfect humor, great action &amp; Pokemon, stupid eps like clefable making space ship or a Psyduck movie, so goodthen I started geeking out finding list of all pokemon to the newest generation, Then I played Emerald it was so cool the region isn't linear, Blaziken became my favorite pokemon, it was Infernape till this point &amp; wow that game was just awesome, I got destroyed by twin gym leaders but I never forget after like weeks how i beat them, since they were psychic my fire &amp; fighting attacks weren't doing anything but slash did the trick, i remember getting lost because of HMs, I loved the rayquaza cut scene, in hoenn Legandary pokemon felt like Legandary pokemon the most, It tuykk so hard to catch rayquaza but I did and destroyed the pokemon league and did some battles in battle frontier.

This section us only about Sinnoh Anime, I loved it with Dawn contests which btw I loved in Emerald. The Cyrus plot &amp; The Bounty Hunter spoiler alert who literally died on her ship, Great characters like Barry and other reoccurring friends which many other gens lack, A brilliant Infernape arch which made it my favorite pokemon. And Paul was awesome, about the Sinnoh trilogy I love rise of darkrai and like the Arceus film, the Arceus movie had great action with a great pokemon. Arceus being one of my favorite pokemon next to Dialga. And the theme song Stand up is great, all the theme songs actually are great I love hearing them. Pokemon anime is inconsistent but the movies were very good and watchable.

So now I was back into the franchise, then I saw movies &amp; remembered damn Lucario movie is so good and Lucario became my favorite then. And is till now. So i love Kanto anime kinda bored with johto but fine, hoenn was good, sinnoh was awesome, unova was ok, kalos was great again, Alola was good, Haven't really been watching journey's tbh.(I will) because of Lucario.

I played more games from gen 1. Platinum and BW2 were awesome, HG/SS region didn't get me but they were enjoyable still, played pokemon duel loved it please bring it back, I still occasionally play Pokemon Go that hype craze was something else. I played some hack games like glazed &amp; again love em, I like designs of pokemon so much that I don't like playing games with fake designs tbh. My least favorite pokémon is scatterbug. Then I made the account after seeing a post where @pokemonisalife reached a milestone. I got into competitive with Showdown and used to make teams &amp; play that everytime in gen 7, that meta is very special to me.

The game quality has been decreasing lately, I still think they were good I didn't like sun &amp; moon art style first but I'm fine now, usum I think is a decent game, hype for a new switch game was high, but swsh didn't really live up but I think they are just fine games. I had cards but never learned the rules but probably will now.

Didn't really like dynamax but I love mega evolutions I used to watch their stats on Poketype app. I think people want better games because they love the franchise so much, they do get annoying and toxic like seriously don't hate masuda or anything for no reason, that man is a veteran who directed your favorite games &amp; was depressed when Pokémon was expected to fail (but it obviously didn't), 

As of my favorite Pokémon Generation, I think there's good thing in every gen, I love Hoenn's map most, Hoenn's game most, Sinnoh's legend most, Sinnoh's lore, Sinnoh's anime most, Gen 5 had great mystery around it which was awesome, I love every gen even if I think quality has been declining, I love Sinnoh &amp; Hoenn equally, and unova too with heavy bias and some great points and don't hate absolutely hate any gen tbh.

Pokemon has been rushing games recently but I kinda like new content every year not necessarily a game every year, The designs of pokemon have always been great, I was kinda hating the alola designs like what there's a sand castle pokemon now?!? But now no they were good designs but different style. I wish the series gets better on par with Zelda because if a fellow series is doing that good obviously you want your favourite series to do good too. &amp; Speaking of anime you know how star wars has like 10 shows in development yeah so that should happen to Pokemon, like 3-4 shows, one likr pokemon generations, one lore thing &amp; whatever else they want. Even after 25 years this franchise is popular.

I think no matter what happens I'll keep following pokemon, there was a time when I was dis interested in the franchise for like 2 weeks but nope couldn't keep longer than that. I love this occasional directs, they excite me up so much always. No matter whatever the pokemon smile, sleep they release, BTW I'm not gonna be that person leaving franchise at age 40 or whatever, nope you can expect me to play gen 32 when I'm like 80 or whatever.",,,1614450482

lr7z6h,SirAren,harrypotter,"Happy Birthday Newt Scamander🎂🎉It's [Newt Scamander's](https://imgur.com/a/a116M9s) 124th Birthday today, He was born on 24 Feb, 1897. He is a Hufflepuff protagonist of The Fantasic Beasts series, He wrote a best seller book named Fantastic Beasts And Where to Find Them. 

He loves to travel around the world he travelled to a hundred countries across five continents while researching his book, Newt's Boggart was an office desk, as Newt feared the idea of being forced to work in an office job for his future career. 

He is different from most heroes, He is barely able to make eye contact and is very awkward around people, He is a magizoologist loves his animals &amp; always help people, Dumbledore trusts him because he is not tempted by power, Newt is everything Dumbledore wishes he was, Newt helped him many times, He later married to Tina Goldstein, In 1979, he was awarded the Order of Merlin, Second Class, for his services to Magizoology. He was also honoured with a Chocolate Frog Card named after him. 

As of me I really love his character he's a very different kind of hero &amp; that's great, He is a great protagonist he shows that everyone can be a hero, He has interesting character traits &amp; also sone flaws which makes his character better",,,1614156483

lp2ji6,SirAren,harrypotter,"LOTR is better than Harry Potter posts are annoyingI've seen this so many times on Reddit and other websites people saying lotr is better than Harry Potter and Harry Potter is the most overrated thing to ever exist, and they even compare lotr to Game of Thrones saying it's very overrated too, it's almost as if they feel threatened with any other fantasy series getting popular, One of the many things they say it's that The scale of Lotr is much bigger than Harry Potter &amp; that's true but you are literally comparing a YA Low Fantasy Book series with a High Fantasy book series also LOTR is like 80 years old on top of that ofc it will be expanded more. in LOTR the stakes are higher but that's doesn't make a story great but that's where the superiority comes in minds is some subreddits *cough* r/lotrmemes , And another arguement is that LOTR has 17 Oscars while Harry Potter had 0, well first I think Lotr movies are great, Return of the king is one of the best movie ever made imo, but Oscars is not a a great measure of comparing movies, MCU won its first Oscar with Black Panther but there are better movies than that in that series.

Oscars are very biased, they don't give big Blockbusters recognition, Dark Knight wasn't nominated for Best Picture but it should've. 
Also I've seen them saying Fantastic Beasts 2 is just awful while completely ignoring the Hobbit Trilogy which in my opinion was way worse, that trilogy wars boring, rushed with awful CGI. But they conveniently ignore those films.

There are also another breed of these fans, saying Harry Potter copied lotr, like oh Dumbledore = Gandalf copied confirmed, hocrux = the one ring copied confirmed, Nazgul looks like Dementors copied confirmed, as if they aren't common fantasy tropes, and even the examples of things Tolkein didn't even invent, Tolkein definitely deserves respect because he shaped modern fantasy but just because there are similarities between HP &amp; LOTR or doesn't mean JK copied Tolkein. Also Hating Harry Potter is cool because JK sucks now apparently.

I like lotr too but I don't it doesn't have flaws, The books have painfully slow pacing, Tolkein takes song brakes &amp; sometimes gives too much detail that the reader doesn't need, most characters in the books are underdeveloped. Silmarillion is like a religious text which no one would like to re-read. I'm not saying you can't like LOTR more than HP or think it's better btw

I bet if the Wheel of Time adaptation gets popular they'll start comparing it to LOTR too, I really like Lotr   Sam is a well written character, the worldbuilding is one of the best the genre has ever seen with the likes of Wheel of Time. The Trilogy is awesome and deserved the Oscars it got. But the fanbase is so awful &amp; it's not most of them but a good chunk of them are like this. Both Harry Potter and Lord of the rings are different stories written in different time with different goals.",,,1613930181

lgmmqe,SirAren,movies,"All 10 Wizarding World movies ranked by me[The Wizarding World franchise](https://imgur.com/a/gyn7NNr) is probably my favorite movie series of all time next to Star Wars, Toy Story &amp; Middle Earth movies, I thought it'd be fun to rank them because I like them so much, Harry Potter movies weren't as good as the books but they were very good &amp; faithful adaptations imo, &amp;  I like The Fantastic Beasts movies too, Idk why some people don't. Ok so I rank the movies from my least favorite to most favorite, This isn't an objective list btw


_10. Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone_

This movie was very enjoyable the first time I watched it, experiencing the magical world for the first time (I saw the movies first), All the Characters are great and likeable &amp; The world building is great, it's my least favorite because it's very slow paced now that I watch it again, there isn't any plot here there's no second act just setting up the world, the Quidditch scenes weren't the best shot, The acting by anyone I don't think was bad but still not too great except Ron's expressions, The CGI is super rushed &amp; doesn't look the best, the whole chess thing in the end was kinda dumb imo, I give this movie a (B-)


_9. Harry Potter &amp; The Order of The Phoenix_

This movie was fine, it's always great to be at Hogwarts, the movie should've included the Hospital scene where Neville meets his parents, Voldemort is back but I couldn't care less because of Unbridge, she was a great villian &amp; is om Joffrey level of annoying, The actress did a great job, The Climax of the movie was good, Luna Lovegood was good in this film too, The Harry Potter series has some of the best casting ever imo, I give this movie a (B).


_8. Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them_

Newt is so great a great protagonist imo, Jacob is funnier than Ron, Fred &amp; George, Queenie is cool, Tina I think could be more developed. This is one of the best prequel movies I have seen, Even if you haven't seen Harry Potter you can see this film &amp; not get lost anywhere, It was very enjoyable to come back to the Wizarding World, (B+)


_7. Harry Potter And the Chamber of Secrets_

This movie is slightly darker than the first one, this film has better acting &amp; The CGI is better, The Quidditch scenes I noticed were better and even the Moaning Myrtle CGI was better than the Ghost's CGI in the first movie, people say the pacing was slow but I disagree, I think it was fine, It was very mysterious and had an interesting plot. Lockhart was funny too, (B+)


_6. Harry Potter And the Deathly Hallows Part 1_

After this film every studio started cutting their books into parts, The Hobbit, Twilight &amp; The Hunger Games, &amp; I think it wouldn't be controversial If I say that Harry Potter did it the best, This film was a great set up &amp; Deathly Hallows Part 2 was an epic satisying payoff, this film has grown on me, We are out of Hogwarts &amp; things are the darkest they've been, The Peverell Brothers sequence was great, Dobby was great, he should've appear more in the movies before but anyway he was great &amp; his death was tragic. (A-) I think it's very underrated &amp; is a very good film.


_5.Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince_

This movie is definitely isn't better than Deathly Hallows Part 1, I just like it more, instead of focusing on Voldemort's memories they focus on romance all the time &amp; Ginny &amp; Harry didn't work, I rate it higher because it was funny, This book was very dark but they made it into a really funny film, The Luck Potion thing or any other scene was funny, It had great cinematography and Thai was cool, The Climax was done perfectly but should've included Dumbledore's funeral, This is a (B) movie imo &amp; it's higher because I just enjoy it more.


_4. Harry Potter And The Goblet of Fire_

This film could've been done way better but it was very enjoyable, They should've shown us a Quidditch match at the beginning &amp; the attack of death eaters could've started then, I like changes, this movie cut a lot from the book &amp; It didn't do the mysteries that great, This film is flawed but very enjoyable. (B+)


_3.Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban_

Alfonso Cuaron made a beautiful film, The CGI is miles better than the first two films, This film had the best soundtrack &amp; the best cinematography, The camera was always moving and this films stands out from the other films, It didn't focus on Voldemort but Sirius Black which was fine, Gary Oldman wasn't in that movie much but his scenes were best, In this film the acting is now very very good like actual actors, Lupin is the best Defense Against the Dark Arts Proffessor imo, I really like this film &amp; I think it's an (A+).


_2. Fantastic Beasts And The Crimes of Grindelwald_

This film definitely is not better than Prisoner of Azkaban &amp; Many would put it at last, I don't get that though, Yes it's a drawn out confusing film but I really liked this film, The Grindelwald escape scene was cool, Jacob was good as always, Tina still needed more screentime but The Salamander Scene was the best romantic scene in The Wizarding World history &amp; you can't change my mind, The Worldbuilding is the best in this film, Jhonny Depp was great in this film, Hopefully Mads also does a performance like this, Nicolas Flamel was a great, Jude Law as Dumbledore is perfect casting and this film didn't bore me tbh, When I watched this film a second time it was better, The Whole Corbus thing was kinda useless imo, The Grindelwald's Rally was The best part imo, he showed them the future &amp; The Blue Protego Fires look soo cool, Avada Kedavara looks like a Child's play now, Credence finally went with Grindelwald &amp; Even Queenie, which Idk she might by spying but can't say anything yet. JK Rowling's script had many problems that's why Steve Kloves came to fix the third film, and despite all of this I really enjoyed this film &amp; I'm very excited for future movies, People should given them a chance, Idk what to rate it, it's definitely not an A movie but I like it to that degree, Idk Let's just not give it a score. It's definitely not objectively the second best movie here


_1. Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2_

This film was at rocket speed pacing &amp; this film always knew when to stop for emotions, and I didn't talk about Snape in this review but he was great, Alan Rickman was great in all of the films, Snape's memory sequence was very emotional, And when Harry went to surrender against Voldemort there was another great scene with his parents, &amp; when he met Dumbledore, that scene was also great, Neville gave the best speech, Nagini died &amp; Voldemort was finally defeated, everything was satisying &amp; then everyone's children went to their Hogwarts Journey, This film is one of my all time favorite and it's Absolutely an (A+) in my book.",,,1612934145

m5t5vn,Ok_Fennel6151,ShingekiNoKyojin,"[Manga Spoilers] To all the Manga Readers who spoil stuff: Fuck youI got into Attack on titan a few months ago and I was determined to binge it before the final season starts and then I would move onto the manga. I've become pretty obsessed and It's become my number 1 anime.  I've watched a lot of reaction videos, and I enjoy them a lot but I hate the fact that i can't look at the comments, and **especially** replies, because of those fucking pricks who just drop spoilers without even thinking about anyone. It's not always super direct, but the ""hinted"" ones end up making me feel the same way anyways. Like if the person mentions how a character might die, they'd leave some stupid comment like ""that would suck"". That's why I hate getting into a new series, why I never google characters because the search suggestions and related questions will spoil it, and why I fear reading comments. Can I not enjoy seeing other people enjoy the series without some asshole getting joy from ruining for everyone else?

The reason I'm super pissed off right now is because someone spoiled the entire ending of Attack on Titan for me. The whole goddamn thing. And in the most unlikely place ever. The Promised Neverland's subreddit. a whole other fucking anime. And these pricks think their smart, spoiling it in other subreddits or things unrelated to anime. It pisses me off and I'm mad because I've followed this show. Not for long as I said but I was looking forward to reading the ending myself and enjoying it.

m5r8iw,Ok_Fennel6151,TheLastAirbender,"Legend of korra is a terrible sequel and should be re-written (Long post, I don't blame you if you don't read it) 

I watched Avatar as a kid and I absolutely loved it and I was a little disappointed that it didn't get a season 3 but then Legend of Korra came out I was pretty excited and I watched it. ATLA was my entire childhood. My entire family's favorite thing to do was to watch some old Avatar episodes. It was a pretty big thing.

I was a kid so I didn't care about the major flaws in LOK, I just missed Avatar so much and I wanted to see Team Avatar again. Now I'm older now and I re-watched it and I realized how terrible it is. I had to remind myself watching this that the creators of AVATAR made this. That THIS came from Avatar. There are a lot of problems with the show that LOK fans love to ignore but I'm going to address it. I know I'll get downvoted into oblivion but just hear me out:

1. Korra is a bad Avatar

I'm not gonna be like other ATLA fans who hate her because she's a narcissistic brat who acts more like a child then a 20 year old woman. It was hard to watch her sometimes I'll admit. But I understand why they made her like that and it made sense because look at Aang. He started out as a cute goofy kid and developed into a powerful avatar. 'Korra was a powerful avatar but learned how to become human'.

The reason I put quotations is because that was the IDEA of Korra but these goddamn writers **fucked it up.** I liked the idea of doing that with Korra but they got the wrong people to handle it. The reason i hate her character is because she never grew out of being a brat she stayed a brat for all 4 seasons.

Korra is a really bad avatar. First of all she gets her ass kicked in every fight she has. I understand that she shouldn't win EVERY fight like Aang but it irritates me that she loses EVERY SINGLE FIGHT. She can't even win unless she has help. At the start of the series she has mastery of 3 elements, on paper she should be extremely op, but she's always losing in fights constantly.

Throughout season 1 she pretty much gets slaughtered by most opponents she faces like Amon or Tarlock. Up until the last episode where she somehow breaks out of his bloodbending with just airbending. And in season 2 she literally gets beaten up by her uncle and the evil spirit dude so bad that she loses her connection to the previous Avatars ( which makes me a bit pissed off). In season 3 to be fair she is poisoned in her fight with Zaheer, and it is pretty clear that without the poison she would have beaten Zaheer pretty easily. But season 4 and she's so weak and rusty that she can't even stand a chance to Toph. But hey, she's weaker because of her personal trauma, I get that. But she gets over it once she removes the poison, so that should mean that she's back to her former strength, if not just slightly weaker, but nope. She fights that metal bending girl in a 1v1, (I forget her name) and she doesn't even stand a chance, what the hell. I'm sorry but that fight was extremely laughable because I was hyped to see Korra because maybe she would be stronger but I guess not.

No matter how rusty she is how the hell is she losing THIS badly to some annoying metal bender, she's the Avatar for christ's sake, master of ALL 4 ELEMENTS and this show expects me to believe she can lose to the uniter, Korra can barely even use the Avatar state either and when she does she makes it look like a joke.

Second, she lost literally all of the past Avatar lives. The show kind of swept this under the rug, but it's a HUGE problem. Centuries of wisdom and unique perspectives just erased because of her incompetence. The past lives are a major advantage of the Avatar and now they're gone. Now the next avatar won't have any wisdom or help and i honestly feel bad for him. Mastering all the elements isn't an easy task but doing it alone is even harder. It doesn't even hurt Korra seeing as she barely ever made the effort to try contacting them but then again, apparently training means very little in LoK so maybe they really are 'unnecessary.'

3. The Love Triangle

This really annoyed me because ATLA had romance but they didn't make it the main focus. But the triangle in Korra and just the relationships in general were all over the place. What was the point of this?

4. Korra and Asami

I don't have a problem with lgbt representation, being bisexual myself, but I hate when they do it in the wrong ways. This whole relationship was so contrived it made me laugh because it was so random. I would have loved this relationship if they developed it, let alone even HINTED IT. The writers basically screamed ""bisexual avatar"" and dipped, leaving me and other fans confused. I also dislike this relationship because it was yet another stereotype that a muscular girl has to be a lesbian. And it's ridiculous fanfics, fucking FANFICS, developed this relationship more than the actual show. I would have preferred Korra to stay single because the romances in this show were a complete trainwreck. This is what's wrong with LOK. It had an amazing vison but they got the wrong people and writers to EXECUTE that vison. LOK could have been a kickass sequel but ended up failing.

5. The Sub-Bending types and retconning

Sub bending types in ATLA were unique and only masters or amazing bending users could do it. for example, Azula was a firebending master, therefore she had the ability to bend lightning. That's why I don't understand why in LOK mere firebenders like Mako could just lightning bend without any training. Sub bending types were supposed to be unique so why is it that now EVERYONE can do it? Lightning bending became a normal technique, so normal that the people generating energy for Republic city are poor. Lighting Bending used to be so scarce that Zuko didn't even knew about the techniques existence till Azula didn't attack him with it. The only people who possessed this technique were all master benders Azula, Ozai and Iroh. Flying previously was done again only by master benders during Sozins comet, Now Korra and Mako do it like nothing. And now Bolin can just lavabend. I guess everything comes easily in LOK.

Now, the retconning. The fucking retconning.

I don’t usually have a problem with retconning because the shows I watch that have retconning make necessary changes. LOK made unnecessary changes. Their first mistake was changing the origins of bending. I find it really funny that the writers changed this because its as if they take ATLA fans for idiots. Like they wouldn’t notice that they changed the origins of the whole bending system. I used to think it was cool that people learned bending from the animals in their culture but then LOK says no let’s make it come from a fucking lion turtle. It’s lame and its not the same. Its not unique at all.

The avatar was the bridge between the physical world and the spirit world and to enter the spirit world you had to be extremely spiritual. LOK says no, lets just go through a spirit portal. Makes Aang look like a freaking idiot for waiting until the winter solstice and risking his life going to the fire nation to talk to Roku when he LITERALLY could have just moved his finger like Korra to open the portal. It makes the plot of LOK look so stupid it makes my head spin.

6. Unanswered Questions

People waited 4 years for Legend of Korra so that it would answer all the questions that were left in Avatar. Where is Sokka? where is Azula? What happened to Zuko's mom? Aang's adult life? I watched LOK mostly to find out about what happened but they just moved on from Aang and the old gang as if no one cared about what happened to them during their adult life.

In my mind, LOK doesn't exist, it's just bad wattpad fanfiction.",,,1615832625

m273xi,Ok_Fennel6151,rant,"[Unpopular Opinion] The Hunter X Hunter fanbase is toxic and it needs to stopI don’t like the Chimera Ant Arc. The remotely important fights were Gon vs Pitou and Netero vs Meruem (tbh that sucked too). I get that every fanbase is toxic in someway but the Hxh fanbase toxicity is over the roof. 

I fucking hate how whenever someone says their opinion on it with VALID AND GOOD POINTS, people call them names and act toxic and it’s fine to debate on opinions right? But the people who like the arc don’t even give valid points, they just say shit like “lmao then don’t watch it” or “you don’t deserve to watch good ANIMES” or ""your just an idiot"". LIKE SHUT THE HELL UP OR GIVE A VALID FUCKING REASON! I admit some parts were cool like Killua's godspeed but like...holy shit for an arc that’s like what, 80 something episodes long, there’s only like few scenes that were actually decent.

There was an old thread about someone who said he liked HxH until the Chimera Ant arc and a few of the comments was actually disgusting, especially some asshole who mentioned the OP had to come back after he 'grows up' or whatever... that is an example of the toxicity. And someone even called him a retard. It's shit like THAT, that made me hate the fanbase. The fanbase is full of immature people who act like the show is the best thing since the discovery of sliced bread.

Another thing that annoys the fuck out of me is that the show isn't even that good and people act like their lives will end if someone doesn't like it. Yorknew and the Hunter Exam were MASTEPIECES but the rest of the arcs were boring and lame I fell asleep watching them and switched to Angel Beats.

I love all 4 of the main characters but I do have more interest in Kurapika's story because it gets more dark and it jumps straight into the action. Not to mention we get to see so many powerful nen users.  Gon and killua are cool but when Kurapika takes the lead, the story gets more political and dark, which makes the story so much more interesting.   Also he has a pretty interesting personality and he is total badass so I like to watch him in general. Don't get me wrong, I love",,,1615403307

When I was 16 I paid more attention on getting good grades, hanging out with my friends, joining clubs NOT GETTING LAID EVERY WEEK.

He is the neediest guy on this show. He can't be single for a moment, and he doesn't have real feelings for any of these girls. From Grundy, to Veronica, back to Grundy, then to Val, right to Veronica, to being jealous of Betty and Jughead but still with Veronica, TO BETTY AND VERONICA IN ONE DAY.

For example, Betty confessed to him in S1 and Archie respectfully said he didn't share her feelings and there's totally NOTHING wrong with that, he didn't act like a dick rejecting her, but the problem is that the next day when he sees Betty and Jughead together, he acts jealous and even worse, acts like he as a RIGHT to be jealous. Last time I checked, you told Betty you didn't like her so WHY THE SUDDEN CONCERN IN HER RELATIONSHIP??

There's no hope for this anime anymore. They just skipped an entire fucking arc. And NOT just any arc! The GOLDY POND BATTLE ARC. That's one of the best arcs in the series and not to mention it's where Emma and Ray get their character development and they learn to shoot and stuff like that. What the hell? Why is Norman there?

Ok, for Esdeath, I'm not going to say I expected her to be all cute and innocent because her first appearance in the series already showed her true nature.

lieidl,Ok_Fennel6151,Scandal,"Fitz RantNow ""Fitz,"" let's face it, is already the dumbest name ever while being the most perfect name for **T.V's most dumpable man.** Some might see it as him being **""born to be president""**, while I see it as **bad naming skills.** His parents could have gone with the typical straight white male names like **Tom** or **Billy** but no. They chose **FITZGERALD.** To make it worse, he's cheating on his wife with Olivia Pope and NO ONE seems to have a problem with it.

To be honest, they are the worst couple I’ve ever seen in T.V history. I would choose Game of Thrones incest any day. Olivia and Fitz’s relationship is nothing but yelling and sex. If you don’t know how their relationship goes, it goes like this.

1. Olivia probably walks in on Fitz having a conversation with his White House Chief of staff Cyrus and makes some stupid remark
2. Fitz tells everyone to clear the room with Cyrus rolling his eyes like I am right now.
3. Olivia says something like “How could you do this to me” or “You should have listened to me”
4. Fitz yells at her that he did what he thought was right, blah, blah BLAH
5. Olivia yells back awhile he walks towards her and kisses her
6. She smacks him and then kisses him \*eye roll\*
7. Then sex happens

So yeah that’s the wannabe power couple that everyone’s obsessed with.

Even though Olivia is a terrible person, she probably **deserves better than Fitz.**

Anyway, why does Olivia **deserve better than Fitz?** Because we all **deserve better than Fitz.** Did you hear me, O Women Of The World? If you are reading these words, you deserve better than Fitz. Unless, that is, you are Mellie, Fitz's wife, who exactly deserves Fitz, which is part of what makes the show's central romantic mythology kind of hard to give a damn about. If Olivia had a lick of sense, she would make the ""that's that"" motion with her hands like she's smacking the dust off, say ""ptooey,"" and go sleep with someone more worthwhile. Meaning: anyone.

Fitz and Mellie would go off and have a whole bunch of evil babies and tour the world like the Von Trapp Family Singers, only they would be a troupe of lying, Kennedy outfit wearing hypocrites who would cry and complain instead of singing ""So Long, Farewell. Because honestly:

Fitz is the **worst**. He is the absolute **worst**. In case you don't believe me, I am prepared to present my list of reasons:

1. Personally murdered an old lady with cancer to save his own neck. Sure, she tried to assassinate you but you could have given her to the authorities not suffocate the woman.
2. Cheated on his wife and managed to blame both the wife *and* the cheatrix. (I just made that word up; I think we need it.) (Especially for this show.)
3. Found out he became president because Oliva and everyone rigged the election, and instead of setting anything right, looked at everyone who made him president and was like, ""HOW COULD YOU? I AM THE SADDEST BOY IN ALL THE LAND.""
4. Borrowed from the military a guy named Jake, who Fitz told to spy on Olivia BY PUTTING CAMERAS IN THE WOMAN’S BEDROOM. THAT'S NOT CREEPY AT ALL.
5. Probably responsible for getting Jake thrown in The Big Box O'Jail, a terrible tiny hole in a cement floor where nobody has fun.
6. Somehow managed to feel betrayed when he found out that while he was with his wife in the office he doesn’t deserve, his cheatrix slept with the guy he hired to stalk her. **WOE IS FITZ!**
7. When he's sad, makes a face like he's trying to pass a kidney stone.
8. Threatened his wife that if she didn't go away quietly and leave him and Olivia to restart what they call a life, he would ruin her political future by *telling everyone she was a racist* who doesn't like his relationship with Olivia because Olivia is black
9. Oh, wait — that was after he bragged to his wife about how his relationship with Olivia was going to be a **boon to race relations in America.** I can’t stop cackling when he said that.
10. Clearly believes his unhappiness is his father's fault, because he can't even take responsibility for anything.
11. Clearly believes the problems in his relationship with Olivia are more the result of the fact that she doesn't understand him and nobody understands him and WOE IS FITZ and less the result of the fact that he is a **stupid, married, jerkface weasel.**
12. **Who PERSONALLY MURDERED AN OLD LADY WITH CANCER TO SAVE HIS OWN NECK.**
13. Who had the audacity pull Olivia into a room, have crazy yelling sex and then tell her ""whoops sorry it was a mistake, too bad i can't control my erections around you"". Fitz couldn't keep it in his pants even if his life **depended** on it.
14. Could **NOT STOP BITCHING** after he found out about defiance. **“YOU NEVER BELIEVED I COULD HAVE WON MYSELF”** Fitz, just SHUT UP. You never deserved it anyway. Was rigging the election bad? Yes. Did it get him living in a mansion with 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 6 levels? Yes. Did it give him the opportunity to control or help America. Yes. So he needs to shut the hell up.

Olivia should dump Fitz. Mellie should dump Fitz. Everybody should dump Fitz. People who have never met Fitz should dump Fitz. White House tour groups should be brought through his office for the one purpose of dumping him at the end of the visit. Strangers should be encouraged to to dump him in more and more violent ways like that dude from Airplane.

Because Fitz is the worst.

He couldn't just been born a racist, HE alone created this ideology so it must have come from some sort of event.

I'm not going to excuse what he did, I'll admit he was pretty fucked up in the head, but imagine what time he lived in. He lived in a time where his fellow wizards and witches were being hanged and burned alive, just for being who they were. Reading about the Salem Witch Trials reminded me that in the Harry Potter World, wizards and witches most likely faced a lot of persecution and were actively being hunted by muggles. Salazar did live over a thousand years ago in the 900's so that was probably the reality for him.

I think he did it out of anger, creating the Chamber. Also, I think that's why he hates muggle borns and he created the racist ideology that most pure blood witches and wizards adopted at that time because they were fed up. They were tired of being executed and humiliated. That's maybe where this philosophy stemmed from.

BECAUSE of muggles, wizards and witches were persecuted to near extinction and BECAUSE of muggles, there are barley ANY pure blood wizarding families left. It was the political climate he lived in. I'm not saying what he did wasn't sick and twisted but he was probably mentally and emotionally fucked up. This is just my take on it but I just think there was more to it than him just being simply a racist if you get what I mean.",,,1612362166

lb6pro,Ok_Fennel6151,harrypotter,"The Chamber of Secrets Scared meAs a kid both reading and watching Chamber of Secrets, I was paranoid and terrified. Even though my Patronus is a Basilisk, that didn't stop me from getting freaked out. It felt like a fucking horror movie.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Students getting petrified. I found this very scary as a kid and still do, as all of a sudden kids were just getting paralyzed. And at the dead of night. Not to mention they got petrified in the scariest ways. Colin Creevy saw the Basilisk through his CAMERA. Imagine seeing a snake the size of a house with big yellow eyes staring at you through your CAMERA. My boy Colin was probably like ""Lalalalala oooo what's tha-AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!""
2. The bathroom scene with Ginny was the scariest because of Tom Riddle's narrating and the dark music that was going throughout the scene. The whole scene was just really unsettling.
3. Blood writings on the wall, threatening to kill people. ALSO at nighttime
4. Harry getting warnings to not go to school by an elf who  clearly seems scared.
5. Hagrid's roosters turning up dead everywhere. Another horror movie troupe. The animals ALWAYS KNOW shit is going down and they get killed for knowing.
6. Ginny disappearing with another scary blood writing on the wall talking about her Skelton lying underground forever.
7. The Basilisk talking in the walls saying this: “Come … come to me. … Let me rip you. … Let me tear you. … Let me kill you. …”
8. The fact that Salazar Slytherin created this thing to kill muggleborn children is just disgusting. That's some Nazi shit. I'm a Slytherin watching/reading this thinking ""wow this guy was really fucked up in the head""
9. Huge monstrous snake in a dark chamber underneath the school picking off all the students like this is Friday the 13th
10. Also Aragog. I have Arachnophobia and Trypophobia so watching little spiders crawling around just grossed me and creeped me out

I had to remind myself throughout that experience that this was Harry Potter, not The Conjuring.

l9it6y,Ok_Fennel6151,harrypotter,"The Slytherin Hate is AnnoyingYes, I get that Slytherin was house based on racism, there's no excusing that, but the hate for it is a little ridiculous. I'M a Slytherdor (Gryffindor and Slytherin) and I really dislike the fact that Slytherin is automatically painted as the ""evil house"" and this belief that everyone who is in Slytherin is evil because there were a lot of people in Slytherin that ended up saving and helping the Wizarding World.

For example, Regulus Black sacrificed his LIFE to bring down Voldemort, Cissy saved Harry which resulted in Voldemort's DEFEAT, Leta Lestrange also killed trying to save her fiancée and her friends from GRINDLEWALD. Slughorn was a kind man, a coward yeah, but he was brave enough to give Harry the memory of Voldemort, Severus was a spy for Dumbledore and protected Harry and was killed as a result! 

For fuck's sake, MERLIN, one of the greatest wizards of all time, was in Slytherin.

He wasn't evil. 

None of them were. 

Also HARRY's son is in Slytherin so does that make him racially superior by default?

It's really disappointing that JK Rowling didn't think Slytherin students should be in the Room of Requirement with Neville in Year 7 because she said they were ""evil"".

l703ti,Ok_Fennel6151,AkameGaKILL,"Why I hate Seryu1. She's a bipolar psychopath

When she first got introduced, I can't deny I thought she was really adorable and she looked like your typical anime girl. She was smiling, she had a dog- she was cute. But then behind all that seemingly happiness, there's a twisted, sadist deep down. Seryu basically turns into a total psychopath in battle and when she's finished mutilating/killing someone, she goes back to that fake, smiling façade and plays kids or something which is mildly disturbing.

&amp;#x200B;

2. She's a hypocrite

Seryu, or should I say Justice Bitch, is a hypocrite. She loves to preach and go on and on about justice and loves to say that the Night Raid are criminals when she literally works for an Empire that executes innocent people and works with sadistic fucks like Esdeath, Aria and the Wild Hunt.

3. Her crazy sense of justice

To me, Seryu is like a five year old who can't tell the difference between a crayon and a pencil crayon. But in this case she can't tell the difference between justice and murder. She keeps blending them together and likes to think that their the same. For example, in one episode, she had Koro eat some civilians for stealing food and called them criminals. Those people were poor and starving but in this case, Seryu doesn't care she just decided to murder them. 

4. She mutilated Sheele

I know this is a common, stupid reason to hate her, but Sheele's death really impacted me. I only saw some of her character for one episode but she was very relatable to me and she definitely didn't deserve to get ripped in half by some orange haired-whore and her dog. IMO, she should have had a longer run. Seryu also fed Chelsea's body to Koro so that makes me hate her more.

There are a lot of couples that were more perfect for each other but ended up marrying totally different people and was rushed. But the one relationship I really hate is Ron and Hermione. I know this is an unpopular opinion but this is my take on the relationship. These two have got to be the worst pairing into the entire series. Here's why:

They started out as a cliché that Rowling never fully developed at all. She just did this relationship as fanservice. She even admitted that she did this relationship because everyone asked her too and that they were not a good match and that Hermione should have married Draco or Harry. The whole fandom kept forcing this relationship and using that ""opposites attract"" dynamic to back it up. To start off why they shouldn't be together, is because of Ron.

In *The Philosopher’s Stone,* Ron was judgmental towards her and Harry never bothered to intervene. When she tried to correct him in Charms class, Ron sulked and made a mockery of her. It took the three of them nearly being killed by a troll together and Hermione taking the blame for it for her to be admitted into the boys’ club and for Ron to like her. All Harry and Ron had to do were get placed in the same compartment on the *Hogwarts Express.* 

*Goblet of Fire* saw Ronald Weasley’s behavior take a turn for the worse. Hermione became a last resort for him to take to the Yule Ball. When she turned him down and went to the ball with Viktor Krum, he was incensed. Last I checked, Hermione was *not* his personal property. This sense of entitlement and ownership over Hermione was further exercised when he accused her of *“fraternising with the enemy”*. The lines between Hermione’s agency and Ron’s entitlement would not have been blurred even if she had gone with someone from *Hogwarts*. He was jealous, but this jealousy stemmed from the sense that Hermione, whom he had always taken for granted, was his. Harry silently agreed with Hermione when she accused Ron of treating her like a last resort, but as usual, did not intervene. I love Harry, but he should have called out Ron's behavior because it was really out of line. Jealous or not, you don't do this to someone you call your best friend.

These two can barely have a friendship without arguing and Ron being toxic and manipulative so how on earth are they supposed to hold a marriage together and have kids? They can barely function as it is. I feel like the reason they even hang out is because of Harry. He's the only thing holding this together.

They both have extremely poor communication habits when arguing. Either yelling and insulting one another or ignoring the other altogether. The differences of Ron liking chess and quidditch and Hermione not isn’t an obstacle at all. Hermione doesn’t mind nor hold his interests against him.

But, they ARE toxic together. A handful of moments doesn't count as a healthy friendship or relationship. Ron is extremely arrogant and insecure and loves to start arguments with Hermione throughout the entire series. Especially book six, and reading that book pissed me off at how rude and self centered his behavior was. And they always argue. Over the smallest things. A cat, her intelligence, quidditch, it's ridiculous at this point. Ron is also very jealous of Hermione's intelligence and likes to bully her due to that.

The problem is: we spent a long time seeing them argue, insult, and be dismissive of each other. We see Ron go months happily ignoring her (along with Harry) and we see how upset this makes Hermione. It's emotional abuse, plain and simple.

I also know what it’s like to playfully banter/argue with a friend you have feelings for, but Ron arguing with Hermione and straight up bullying her over nonsense was just ridiculous. If you want a girl to like you Ron, then try stop acting like a jerk.

So, I hate them as a couple because they’re toxic together and we don’t see very many meaningful moments between them.

The Winx club was my favourite show growing up as a kid- and when I found out there was going to be a live action, I was really excited for it. Boy was I WRONG.

For one thing, they have taken some of the best things about the show and converted it into the same typical, stupid teenage tv show. Like Bloom was your typical white teenager with good parents- I'm guessing a lot of people related her to and her struggles. But destroying the mom's character and Bloom's personality has caused me to actively hate this show. Bloom is NOTHING like how they made her in this so called live action. Is this Winx Club or Vampire Diaries?

One of the worst things about this show, though, was Stella. Fucking STELLA. I used to like her when I was younger for her girly girl outfits and sassiness and her friendship with Bloom. But then, this show decided to turn her into a bitch. Here's the real question:

WHY CAN'T WE HAVE ONE BLONDE GIRL WHO CAN BE FRIENDS WITH A GOOD PERSON?

LIKE SERIOUSLY! Why are series so determined to female characters always fighting over a boy and ruining their friendship and making them look like whores?!

I also really hated that Sky was Stella's ex and the love triangle with him, Stella and Bloom. He had SO MUCH more potential in the old series then being a piece of fucking meat that two girls try to fight over. Also, WHERE IS BRANDON? I loved Stella and Brandon because he made Stella more human and made her less self centered. Plus, Brandon was such a good person to be around so where is he Netflix?

And the whitewash, don't get me started on the whitewashing.

Flora basically got replaced by some white girl they decided is her cousin all of a sudden, Musa is replaced by some white girl trying to be edgy even though she is clearly an asian girl and Techna is nowhere to be seen. When I saw the casting I thought ""Whew! Thank god, they got Ayeshia right!"".

But then I see this bullshit.

Like what the hell?

It's not that hard to create a winx live action it really isn't. Just give us representation. THAT'S IT! Why is it so hard to get character's race right? But wait I just realized, it's painful for Netflix or Hollywood in general to make a diverse cast without whitewashing it so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. (Btw where is Tecna?)

I noticed while reading about it that 75 planes and hundreds have ships have disappeared in that region and now I'm wondering where they went. There was no signs of wreckage. If the ships really went down in a typical storm or whirlwind, then where is the wreckage?  What if they didn't crash but went to an alternate dimension?

I created a pretty crazy theory that the Bermuda Triangle could be a portal that leads to either an alternate, different version of this world or a portal that takes the ships/planes to different time periods.  It might seem wild but this was just was I thought.",,,1610642017

(After Akame Ga Kill of course) The characters, the soundtrack, not to mention my boy LEVI, EVERYTHING. There has been no flaws in this show whatsoever. This show has got me emotional on multiple occasions. For god's sake, I was hyperventilating watching S4 trailer.

I started the show/manga a year ago thinking this was your typical post apocalypse, but then, Isayama did a whole 180 and now we find out that there are HUMANS that SENT titans to Paradis to devour innocent people, keep them in from conquering them, and brainwashed us readers/viewers into thinking this was some apocalypse. And that plot twist got me off guard which made it even BETTER. There's one thing I love and it's a genius plot twist.

kt6ck6,Ok_Fennel6151,sad,"I Think I'm in Love with a Fictional CharacterI've always been a daydreamer. I always build characters and scenarios in my mind, mostly taken from existing fiction and pretend that those are my friends and that I live in a fantasy world. It's been a thing with me ever since I was young.

The reason for this is because I'm socially awkward and I avoid talking to people because when I do, I turn into a nervous wreck, so I watch shows and I read books instead. I go to school, I come back home. That's it.

I eventually stopped daydreaming around the time I started middle school because I knew I had to get my head out of the clouds and prepare for high school but now, with all the craziness happening in the world I've been doing it again.

During quarantine, I picked up a few new shows to watch in my free time and I started to have a favorite character. I thought it was just a favorite character, but I think it's going beyond that.

I've collecting figurines, I've watched videos of him multiple times, my room is practically filled with posters of him, I spend 90% of the time drawing fanart of him- you get what I mean.

I don't even know why I fell in love with him. I guess because I related to him in some way because of the things he went through and I loved his personality. I know he's not real. I know he's just a creation from someone's imagination and that I'll never get to meet him or even have a conversation with him and I guess that's what hurts me the most. Sometimes I even cry myself to sleep because I realize that he's not real and I'm just some depressed teenager with no parents and no friends.

Yeah, I know it's stupid and I'm a total idiot for being like this and that I need to snap out of it but I don't know how and I want to find a way to cope/ get rid of this because I know it's not healthy at all.

krbo3m,Ok_Fennel6151,television,"Legend Of Korra RantAvatar was my childhood in a nutshell. I was 12 when I first watched it and like a lot of people, I was really sad when it ended without even telling us what happened after. Now, I'm 27 years old and while in quarantine I decided to start watching LOK, despite my siblings telling me it was a waste of time. So, I just finished watching Legend of Korra a few days ago and I gotta say . . .

I'm very disappointed. This show was absolute shit.

I actually thought this show was gonna be decent because hello, it's from the people who created Avatar so I was thinking it would be a masterpiece like Avatar. Boy, was I wrong.

Bad romance. Boring, copied characters from ATLA. Korra is an arrogant brat. The Avatar State was turned into a joke. The villains are morons (except season 3 I guess). Season one wasn't the worst but it spent most of its time focusing on Pro Bending, which has NOTHING to do with being the Avatar, and Korra's unnecessary bitching. Season 2 was an insult to ATLA all together. Season 3 wasn't bad, but Season 4 was complete fuckery. I understand that the show shouldn't try to be ATLA, but it feels like they overdid it and tried the polar opposite of everything ATLA. Aang was a nice guy. Let's make Korra a whiny bitch. Avatar was a mystical setting. Let's make LOK modern. Basically saying let's remove everything good about ATLA. It could have worked if they didn't fuck it up but they did. I liked the modern setting, but I hated that by removing the mystical setting from ATLA, it took away the supernatural and magical feeling from the last show.

The Story: Let’s start with the story. The lack of an overarching story really hurt the series. It made it feel like a childrens cartoon which ATLA never did. The end just didn't feel like an ending and was unsatisfying, like you could just pick the show up and add another season but with ATLA it concluded perfectly. But by far the thing I hated the most was the lack of consequence. Aang had to work his ass off to control the Avatar State opening the chakras, having nightmares because of lack of control and he suffered on the road even being told he had to sacrifice Katara. What did Korra sacrafice? Aang is a much stronger avatar then Korra ever will be. For fuck's sake, He was 12 YEARS OLD and only had few months and took down a freaking fire lord. Korra had 20 years of prep and still got her ass handed to her in every fight. Plus I hate how the Avatar State has basically been half assed in LOK, it is supposed to be an unstoppable power but Korra gets her ass whooped every time she uses it.

For energy bending Aang had to go through so much trauma being told to kill the firelord and he was probably willing to do it before he discovered energy bending. I hated how there was a lack of consequence. Korra loses her bending, 10 mins later she gets it back. Erases everything Amon did. In ATLA the air nomad genocide was a scar that would forever remind everyone of the horrors of the war. It LOK they magically return. Another point is that the writers overdid the torturing of Korra’s character. The problem with this is it happens too much with no reward. The avatar is supposed to be a badass but in LOK Korra has in every season won with either pure luck, help from someone else, deus ex machina or just pure stupidity. The writers take Korra suffering too far that it becomes boring as fuck. First make me care about the character before attempting to make me feel sorry for them.

World Building: In Atla, aside from the characters, it feels like there was a lot of thought and care put into developing the world around them. And I think that is the sleeper agent that hooked a lot of people, with many not even realizing how crucial it was. It was the foundation that supported everything else. The character development was good, but most if not all the main characters were clichés to begin with, and clichés are at their best when given a fresh interesting world to play around in, like familiar anchors to put us perspective in the world being developed.

In LOK everything takes a backseat to Korra. Which means that the world building they do either directly relates to Korra herself or is simply put together as a backdrop for Korra. Any change or development to the setting/world was made relative to Korra, with little to no thought put into how it relates to what came before, or what will come after.

LOK’s contradiction of ATLA:

1. "" I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes'' Roku In LOK the Avatar only existed for 10,000 years. 10,000/1000= 10 year lifetime per avatar. Not possible.
2. "" The glow is the combination of all your past lives'' Roku In LOK the glow is Raava merging with the Avatar.
3. In ATLA Lightning bending can only be performed by extremely powerful firebenders like Ozai, Iroh and Azula. Even Zuko couldn't do it at first, it took a lot of hard work and training. LOK says fuck that, let's make everyone lightning bend.
4. In ATLA the lion turtle had to bestow the power of the energybending. In LOK apparently you can just obtain it from the previous avatar.
5. In ATLA bending was learned from the dragons, badgermoles, bisons and the moon. In LOK they said fuck that lets make them get it from lionturtles. IMO learning it from other creatures was way cooler. but I guess it keeps up the theme of LOK where everything just gets handed to you without you needing to do shit.
6. Remember when the spirit world was a huge deal. The avatar was the bridge between the physical world and the spirit world and to enter the spirit world you had to be extremely spiritual. LOK says fuck that. Lets just go through a spirit portal. Makes Aang look like a fuckin idiot for waiting until the winter solstice and risking his life going to the fire nation to talk to Roku when he LITERALLY could have just moved his finger like Korra to open the portal.
7. And personally the thing I hated the most about this show, the thing that for me made me absolutely despise this show, is how in LOK the previous avatar can just hand full control of the avatar state to the current avatar. Makes Avatar Roku look like a fuckin idiot. Why didn't he just give Aang control of the avatar state, then he could have just defeated Ozai in Season 1. remember when Aang had to open his chakras to try to control his avatar state. Remember the episode called ' The Avatar State', where Aang had nightmares because of his lack of control of the avatar state. LOK says fuck that.

Conclusion: This is just the tip of the iceberg of what is wrong with this show. Plenty of Youtubers have made videos addressing the issues with this show and there are more that even they haven't caught onto. For me it feels like they've completely destroyed any chance of a new show. There is such a thing as explaining TOO MUCH. Now it feels like the mysteriousness of the Avatar Universe has disappeared with this Raava and Vaatu nonsense. No one cares who the first Avatar was, how people got bending. It would have been nice if those things could have just been unanswered. Would have made the Avatar Universe seem bigger than it actually is. Something I hated about LOK was how little exploring we did. I am sick and tired of seeing Republic City AKA New York City. It feels like there is nothing left to explore. By the time Korra is dead the Avatar world will probably evolve to resemble our world with computers and all kinds of gadgets with Democracies and other bullshit. What fun will it be if the Avatar can master the elements by taking a plane around the world. BOOOOOOORING. They should have never made the Avatar World evolve. It should have stayed the way it was. Fun and adventurous.

You know what they should've done instead? They should have made a show about Kyoshi, an avatar who ACTUALLY DESERVES IT.

And that ending, Oh my fucking god, don't get me STARTED ON THAT ENDING. Korrasami is probably the most random relationship so far. The fact that Korra is dating a girl isn't the problem here. Korra all of a sudden has feelings for Asami, which is really random because those two had NO ROMANCE AT ALL. It was never hinted ONCE. I don't have a problem with lgbt representation, being a lesbian myself, but it came out of the blue.

Their relationship had no development at all and it's ridiculous how FANFICS had more development for this than the actual show. And I'm also all for some black/native woman representation but they tried too hard to make Korra ""the strong female"" and she came off more arrogant than anything else. I wanted Korra to be single, to how that she didn't need a man or woman but nooooooo, the creators had to please these lgbt activists and make them gay even if there is no development.

So I've come to the conclusion that LOK should not be recognized in the Avatar universe. This show is a direct insult to true Avatar fans everywhere and I hate it. I absolutely hate it. It was not needed. And I feel like the only reason I watched it is because I loved Avatar. So, creators, if you make another Avatar sequel, make about Kyoshi, Iroh, my boy Roku because I don't think ANYONE wants a repeat of this show because this was such a let down and a disappointment because Avatar was my childhood show and you basically butchered it.

For energy bending Aang had to go through so much trauma being told to kill the firelord and he was probably willing to do it before he discovered energy bending. Korra gets it handed to her. I hated how there was a lack of consequence. Korra looses her bending, 10 mins later she gets it back. Erases everything Amon did. In ATLA the air nomad genocide was a scar that would forever remind everyone of the horrors of the war. It LOK they magically return. Compared to Aang Korra has had an extremely easy road. I though this was supposed to be a more mature show, but if mature is telling everyone that if you cry you'll get everything handed to you then I'm glad they didn't make this for kids. Another point is that the writers overdid the torturing of Korra’s character. The problem with this is it happens too much with no reward. The avatar is supposed to be a badass but in LOK Korra has in every season won with either pure luck, help from someone else, deux ex machina or just pure stupidity.

Which means that the world building they do either directly relates to Korra herself or is simply put together as a backdrop for Korra and co to happen with/in. Any change or development to the setting/world was made relative to Korra, with little to no thought put into how it relates to what came before, or what will come after.

LOK’s contradiction of ATLA: 1. "" I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes"" Roku In LOK the Avatar only existed for 10,000 years. 10,000/1000= 10 year lifetime per avatar. Not possible. 2. "" The glow is the combination of all your past lives"" Roku In LOK the glow is Raava merging with the Avatar. 3. In ATLA Lightning bending can only be performed by extremely powerful firebenders like Ozai Iroh and Azula. Even Zuko couldn't do it. Now every firebender and his gramma can lightning bend. 4. In ATLA the lionturtle had to bestow the power of the energybending. in LOK apparently you can just obtain it from the previous avatar. 5. In ATLA bending was learned from the dragons, badgermoles, bisons and the moon. In LOK they said fuck that lets make them get it from lionturtles. IMO learning it from other creatures was way cooler. but I guess it keeps up the theme of LOK were everything just gets handed to you without you needing to do shit. 6. Remember when the spirit world was a huge deal. the avatar was the bridge between the physical world and the spirit world and to enter the spirit world you had to be extremely spiritual. LOK says fuck that. Lets just go through a spirit portal. Makes Aang look like a fuckin idiot for waiting until the winter solstice and risking his life going to the fire nation to talk to Roku when he LITERALLY could have just moved his finger like Korra to open the portal. 7. And personally the thing I hated the most about this show, the thing that for me made me absolutely despise this show, is how in LOK the previous avatar can just hand full control of the avatar state to the current avatar. Makes Avatar Roku look like a fuckin idiot. Why didn't he just give Aang control of the avatar state, then he could have just defeated Ozai in Season 1. remember when Aang had to open his chakras to try to control his avatar state. Remember the episode called ' The Avatar State', were Aang had nightmares because of his lack of control of the avatar state. LOK says fuck that.

Conclusion: This is just the tip of the iceberg of what is wrong with this show. Plenty of Youtubers have made videos addressing the issues with this show and there are more that even they haven't caught onto. For me it feels like they've completely destroyed any chance of a new show. There is such a thing as explaining TOO MUCH. Now it feels like the mysteriousness of the Avatar Universe has disappeared with this Raava and Vaatu nonsense. No one cares who the first Avatar was, how people got bending. It would have been nice if those things could have just been unanswered. Would have made the Avatar Universe seem bigger than it actually is. Something I hated about LOK was how little exploring we did. I am sick and tired of seeing Republic City AKA New York City. It feels like there is nothing left to explore. By the time Korra is dead the Avatar world will probably evolve to resemble our world with computers and all kinds of gadgets with Democracies and other bullshit. What fun will it be if the Avatar can master the elements by taking a plane around the world. BOOOOOOORING. They should have never made the Avatar World evolve. It should have stayed the way it was. Random and fun as hell.

You know what they should've done instead? They should have made a show about Kyoshi, an avatar who ACUTALLY DESERVES IT.

And that ending, Oh my fucking god, don't get me STARTED ON THAT FUCKING ENDING. Korra all of a sudden has feelings for Asami, which is really random because those two had NO ROMANCE AT ALL. It was never hinted ONCE. It's like the writers pulled it out of their ass to put wannabe lgbt representation. I don't have a problem with lgbt representation, being a lesbian myself, but . . . . .

WHAT THE FUCK?

Their relationship had no development at all and it's ridiculous how fanfics, FUCKING FANFICS had more development for this than the actual show. And I'm also all for some black woman representation but they tried too hard to make some strong black female and she came off more arrogant then anything else. I wanted Korra to be single, to how that she didn't need a man or woman but nooooooo, the creators had to please these lgbt activists and make them gay even if there is no development.

Ok, rant over",,,1609865756
kr1yxq,Ok_Fennel6151,TheLastAirbender,"The Legend of Korra Sucks. Here's why Intro: I watched this show a day after my emotional journey into Avatar and I gotta say I was very disappointed. This show was absolute shit. Bad romance. Boring, copied characters from ATLA. Korra is an arrogant brat. The Avatar State was turned into a joke. The villain are morons (except season 3 I guess). Season one wasn't the worst but it spend most of it's time focusing on Probending, which has NOTHING to do with being the Avatar, and Korra's unnecessary bitching. Season 2 was an insult to ATLA all together. Season 3 wasn't bad, but Season 4 was complete fuckery. I understand that the show shouldn't try to be ATLA, but it feels like they over did it and tried the polar opposite of everything ATLA. Aang was a nice guy lets make Korra a whining bitch. Avatar was a mystical setting. Lets make LOK modern. Basically saying lets remove everything good about ATLA. It could have worked if they didn't fuck it up but they did. I liked the modern setting, but I hated that by removing the mystical setting from ATLA, it took away the supernatural and magical feeling from the last show.

The Story: Let’s start with the story. The lack of an overarching story really hurt the series. It made it feel like a childrens cartoon which ATLA never did. The end just didn't feel like an ending and was unsatisfying, like you could just pick the show up and add another season but with ATLA it concluded perfectly. But by far the thing I hated the most was the lack of consequence and Korra getting everything handed to her. Aang had to work his ass off to control the Avatar State opening the chakras, having nightmares because of lack of control and he suffered on the road even being told he had to sacrifice Katara. Aang is a much stronger avatar then Korra ever will be. For fuck's sake, He was 12 YEARS OLD and only had few months and took down a freaking fire lord. Korra had 20 years of prep and still got her ass handed to her in every fight. Korra gets it handed to her. Plus I hate how the Avatar State is basically been half assed in LOK, it is supposed to be an unstoppable power but Korra gets her ass whopped every time she uses it. For energy bending Aang had to go through so much trauma being told to kill the firelord and he was probably willing to do it before he discovered energy bending. Korra gets it handed to her. I hated how there was a lack of consequence. Korra looses her bending, 10 mins later she gets it back. Erases everything Amon did. In ATLA the air nomad genocide was a scar that would forever remind everyone of the horrors of the war. It LOK they magically return. Compared to Aang Korra has had an extremely easy road. I though this was supposed to be a more mature show, but if mature is telling everyone that if you cry you'll get everything handed to you then I'm glad they didn't make this for kids. Another point is that the writers overdid the torturing of Korra’s character. The problem with this is it happens too much with no reward. The avatar is supposed to be a badass but in LOK Korra has in every season won with either pure luck, help from someone else, deux ex machina or just pure stupidity. The writers take Korra suffering too far that it becomes boring as fuck. First make me care about the character before attempting to make me feel sorry for them.

World Building: In Atla, aside from the characters, it feels like there was a lot of thought and care put into developing the world around them. And I think that is the sleeper agent that hooked a lot of people, with many not even realizing how crucial it was. It was the foundation that supported everything else. The character development was good, but most if not all the main characters were clichés to begin with, and clichés are at they're best when given a fresh interesting world to play around in, like familiar anchors to put give us perspective in the world being developed. In Lok everything takes a backseat to Korra. Which means that the world building they do either directly relates to Korra herself or is simply put together as a backdrop for Korra and co to happen with/in. Any change or development to the setting/world was made relative to Korra, with little to no thought put into how it relates to what came before, or what will come after.

goeolry,Ok_Fennel6151,thepromisedneverland,"&gt;I thought the manga tanked immediately after they left the farm.

My thoughts exactly. As much as I like Goldy Pond, the series was terrible after that. That's what I hated about the promised neverland. It had the potential to become one of the greats but it was wasted. The Escape Arc is a masterpiece",t3_lpyvq6,t1_goemx71,1614042486

gmyzn7v,Ok_Fennel6151,TrueUnpopularOpinion,Same that was me as a kid. I used to play with dolls and play on a Nintendo with my friends after school but now it feels like the world has changed. And the internet is apart of the problem. Tiktok is corrupting young people and it needs to go. I'm not even old like what your saying and it's just crazy,t3_lhph4a,t1_gmyyuny,1613070835
gmyz6ib,Ok_Fennel6151,TrueUnpopularOpinion,"&gt;Probably foot-scoop until they hit that hyper-rambunctious age where they have some semblance of being able to understand the world.

What the hell is wrong with you? Just don't get a cat if your going to do that to them. Your talking about kicking them when their of age? How about just don't harm your cat?",t3_lgyk5e,t1_gmyyoeb,1613070640

gmy4xqx,Ok_Fennel6151,rant,This story made me speak out against this app and is a example of how dangerous these challenges are: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/09/02/teen-dies-after-doing--tiktok-benadryl-challengeas-doctors-warn-of-dangers/?sh=1a8ee867f0db](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/09/02/teen-dies-after-doing--tiktok-benadryl-challengeas-doctors-warn-of-dangers/?sh=1a8ee867f0db),t3_lhmphw,t1_gmy4ghn,1613058036

gmy3k3k,Ok_Fennel6151,rant,Yes it is. There are a lot of pedophiles on that app which makes it dangerous for kids your age. I don't know what they were thinking allowing this challenge on there when they know kids are active on there. It's disgusting,t3_lhmphw,t1_gmy3ax0,1613057433
gmy2dwb,Ok_Fennel6151,rant,"It's a challenge that shows involves someone dancing sexually in a video with a red filter, disguising their bodies but you can still see their body. Most people who do it, mostly women, go naked or semi naked. I'm glad your not on that app please stay that way",t3_lhmphw,t1_gmy248d,1613056915

gmxyawj,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,Same I don't want to have Six has the main character again. I think they will make another game but focused on a different kid. Or maybe a prequel set before all the other games to show how the world of Little Nightmares came to be. Maybe it was like our world before but something happened,t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxx9ms,1613055097
gmxwwro,Ok_Fennel6151,HunterXHunter,ok i respect your opinion,t3_lh0ucg,t1_gmxwrkn,1613054464
gmxwtbn,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,True. I'm kind of starting not to like Six that much.,t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxwkcw,1613054422
gmxwdo8,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,"As much as much as I would like to say I wouldn't because of friendship , I won't because yeah, I agree, I would do the same even if what she did was cruel. I would want to survive. But I feel like what she did will give her serious karma later if Mono wants revenge later",t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxvp8k,1613054225
gmxw3a0,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,"&gt;Another point to back up that Six was aware of Mono’s eventual transformation is that Monster Six was put in a recreation of the room we save her from in the beginning.

She was could have been planning to leave him after that realization",t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxvmjw,1613054090
gmxw0fa,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,I agree with you that she might have seen his face and got scared that he was the Thin Man and panicked,t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxvmjw,1613054052
gmxvrlg,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,"&gt;It's possible that after Mono fell into the signal tower he was trapped there by it, forced to grow up alone and angry at the girl that he felt betrayed him.

If that is the situation, I feel bad for Mono",t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxuktt,1613053932
gmxvoeh,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,"&gt;At least that's my interpretation. The thing about having a story with no dialogue is that you have to infer a lot from audio and visuals which I think is the charm of Little Nightmares. These games never outright explain anything which keeps the fear of the unknown going as you try to understand everything.

As frustrating as it is to be left with unanswered questions, I'm starting to realize that it's what makes the game so amazing and well written",t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxuktt,1613053888
gmxvk43,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,"&gt;We don't know why Six dropped Mono but it was probably to save her own life, thinking the Signal Tower would keep coming after Mono since he seemed linked with it in some way. Six might've saw Mono as a threat to her life and dropped him.

Most likely. By that point she was thinking ""every man/woman for themselves""",t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxuktt,1613053828
gmxuy53,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,"&gt;But why did Six drop him in the first place?

That's what I've been scratching my head at. Why did she betray him? Maybe she always evil?",t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxuets,1613053532
gmxuo0l,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,"Yeah that's pretty obvious at this point because the original Thin Man is dead. But like what this other guy in the comments said, I believe that he might take revenge on Sasha Six",t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxub0t,1613053397
gmxts2l,Ok_Fennel6151,attackontitan,same,t3_lgxsbi,t1_gmv8qnu,1613052959
gmxtftk,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,"&gt;the way he acts around Mono makes it seem more like he’s trying to interact with him rather than attack him

Yeah I noticed he was more trying to attack Six then him. Maybe he was trying to tell him that Sasha Six would betray him",t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxss6k,1613052789
gmxt6k3,Ok_Fennel6151,LittleNightmares,That makes sense. If this is a prequel that means that Sasha Six will go to the Maw and Mono will play a role as a villain to get revenge on her if they choose to make a third game,t3_lhl78a,t1_gmxss6k,1613052660

IMO Movies aren't supposed to be a 100% recreation of the books are were made to be a movie adaption.  I treat the movies like a separate entity. If you go to the movie for the whole experience you are missing the point. The movies visualize the books and complement them. The movies include most of the important/Best events. I watched the movies right after reading the books and It helped me visualize a lot of things for my next reread.

The main complaint I see people make about the movies is how different they are but, When watching the movies I don't think about how it's inaccurate from the books, I know that the movies are not ""canon"" so why would I treat it as such and except the accuracy to what I know... If it was I would have a problem with the inconsistency but it's not so I don't.

I noticed this about me in the transformers franchise too. Although the bayverse wasn't as good as other shows in the transformers line I found it really easy to understand and follow despite what a lot of critics say. Idk if I'm being smart about it or they are being dumb about It

As for the cringe part, I see that point so If I could I would change the title of this to "" Unpopular Opinion: The movies are GREAT and I have only 1 problem with them.""

Most people like them because of yea the books but also because they can make you feel a wide range of emotion (For me at least), The CGI and visuals were good.

lm9e7l,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Star Wars: Obi Wan was the Chosen One.All we know of the prophecy is ""*A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.""* The force had been thrown out of balance often, but in this case, the Chosen One would bring balance at one of the darkest times in the galaxy.

However, looking it over, Kenobi fits the prophecy far better than Anakin.

First, there's the part about ""no father"". Obi Wan's father has never been revealed in canon, and the one time he told Qui Gon that he was ""like a father"" to him, Qui Gon shut him down (kinda harshly). Prophecies are known for BS and double meaning, and Obi Wan certainly could be called a man with no father.

Then, there's bringing balance to the force. What was the true cause of the imbalance in the force? Palpatine's rise was certainly a part of it, but the Jedi should easily have been able to detect him and defeat him. The Jedi fell because they had become arrogant and overconfident, breaking their own code.

Obi Wan was the perfect example of the Jedi code. He lived only for others, and repeatedly risked his life for others before finally sacrificing himself. He also was the only Jedi to correctly interpret the code on relationships. Obi Wan didn't cut himself off from others; he was an apprentice to Qui Gon, a friend to Cody, a father to Ahsoka, a brother to Anakin, and a lover to Satine. The Jedi code didn't forbid relationships, it forbid *attatchments*. In all those cases, Obi Wan was able to let go of the other person if need be. Maul brutally slaughtered both Qui Gon and Satine, yet Obi Wan never gave in to anger or desire for revenge. Anakin turned to the Dark side, and Obi Wan was willing to kill him to save others. Ahsoka tried to reach out to him after Order 66, but Obi Wan chose to stay hidden and let her think she died, in order to fulfill his mission of protecting Luke.

Anakin could never have balanced the force by killing Palpatine, an inherently violent act. Violence only causes more violence, that was the Jedi belief. Instead, it was balanced by Obi Wan giving up his life freely, at the end of a long life of doing good. He could easily have managed to escape, or at least tried to run, but instead, he chose to offer himself as a sacrifice.

The prophecy of the Chosen One is about the least subtle Christ allegory possible. Who truly fits better with that allegory: Anakin, who failed, turned against humanity, and committed at least 3 separate genocides before his ""redemption""? Or Obi Wan, who, aside from looking like Jesus, suffered through a painful life full of hardships without ever giving in, who kept firm to his moral code, and who eventually sacrificed himself to others? The entire purpose of Jesus (Catholic school is paying off) was to redeem humanity being evil by having someone face all those same temptations as humans, and choose not to give in, then give up that perfect life for others. That's basically just the tagline for the Obi wan show.

**TL;DR: Just look at Ewan McGregor and tell me he isn't the Chosen One of destiny.**",,,1613609012
lm8yy2,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Star Wars: Obi Wan was using Luke as bait for VaderObi Wan's plan for Luke seemed really, really bad. First, he takes him to his extended family, which seems nice... except that there was no real connection there. It wasn't like they already knew Luke, or had any major connection to Anakin. They'd met him *once* for a few hours. There wasn't anything special about them, or any way that they were better suited to raise Luke than literally any other couple in the galaxy. He also decided to keep Luke's last name Skywalker (despite the fact that Owen and Beru's last name was Lars), and only change his own first name, keeping ""Kenobi"". Then, there's the fact that he did aaaallll that *on Anakin's home planet*.

Both of those are *terrible* decisions. Palpatine had literally just demonstrated how intelligent he was, and the resources he possessed. Did Obi Wan really never expect him to take five seconds and check on Vader's family? Especially since the Sith had a weird obsession with murdering family members? Sure, it was a long shot, but it still drew way too much attention. Then, there's continuing to use ""Kenobi"", and even making sure that the local people knew him by that name. Again, in a galaxy full of Imperial spies, probe droids, and Inquisitors, why run that risk? Then, with Tattooine being Anakin's home, there was the added risk of him returning and discovering them by chance. Sith gained power by visiting sites connected to emotional moments for them. Tattooine held the place he'd been owned as a slave, where his mother had died, and where he'd first given in to the Dark Side. 

**Obi Wan purposefully left hints that would draw Vader to Luke, so that Kenobi could then finish the job he had started on Mustafar.**

First off, getting it out of the way: No, Obi Wan wasn't going to let Luke die, or put him in mortal danger. Although he was bending the Jedi code, he was no Sith, and protected Luke with his life, as he showed on the Death Star.

His plan was to leave clues to draw in Vader or Palpatine. We know Jedi can sense one another, even over long distances, so it's very likely he knew that Anakin survived, especially with the spike of pain and emotion putting on his suit. He knew that his own moment of weakness left his brother the puppet of a Sith, and swore to put Anakin out of his misery. He also knew that that moment came because he had allowed himself to form attachments. He swore to never do so again, but over corrected. In doing so, he refused to consider personal feelings at all, ignoring others completely, which was why he was OK with using Luke as bait. 

Obi Wan left Luke with his Aunt and Uncle, then moved a short distance; close enough to monitor them and arrive if necessary, but far enough that Vader wouldn't sense his presence immediately. He then made sure Luke would keep his last name, and spread rumors of his own. Never anything super obvious, but enough that Palpatine's many spies might catch word. 

We know from both the EU and canon that Palpatine at least suspected Padme's children may have survived, and Vader suspected (or hoped) it as well. So, a child with the Skywalker name, using a first name Padme had picked out in advance living with Anakin's family? That would send up some red flags. We also know that Vader was prone to emotional outbursts, doing things without thinking over the consequences first. Learning that Sidious had lied, his son had lived, and that his son was likely force sensitive would absolutely draw him in, and blind him to the possibility of a trap.

Another clue that Obi Wan was planning a confrontation was that he changed his lightsaber form from III (purely defensive) to IV (far more agressive). In the duel on Mustafar, Anakin pressed the attack most of the time, and all Obi Wan could do was try to defend himself, before getting lucky at the end. He trained in a more aggressive combat form to prepare himself for a fight with Vader on more even terms.

However, Vader never showed up. And over time, Obi Wan began to heal from his trauma. We know that he defended the Lars homestead from Tuskens and bandits on a few occasions, as well as saving Luke from threats. In doing so, he began to form a healthy attachment, and reconnected himself with the Jedi code. In Rebels, Kenobi ignores Maul's threats, until Maul threatens Luke, at which point, Obi Wan prepares himself to duel. 

**TL;DR: Obi Wan hoped to lure Vader to Tatooine using Luke, and manage to kill him there. However, over time, he began to love Luke almost like his own son, and let go of his desire for vengeance.**",,,1613607727
lm2o8p,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Young Justice: Phantoms will have the Court of Owls as the main villainsIn each season of Young Justice so far, the Light has teemed up with some supervillain group in order to achieve their goals. In season 4, that group is going to be the Court of Owls.

They were already introduced in Season 3, episode 13 during the metahuman auction [\[1\]](https://imgur.com/a/JQ8LMMQ). The masks the wealthy bidders were wearing looked almost exactly the same as the Court of Owls in the comics [\[2\]](https://imgur.com/a/0IsR1D5). Young Justice has a tradition of adding in Easter eggs and references, *especially* foreshadowing of future villains. Darkseid showed up in the finale of Season 2, after having been hinted at throughout the season. Making such a blatant reference to a large group of criminals, and directly showing them cooperating with the Light to sell metahumans is suggestive, to say the very least.

In addition, Ra's al Ghul is literally cooperating with them. He mentions that he's no longer the leader of the League of Shadows, nor a part of the light. Yet, the show makes it clear he's still involved in *something.* Interestingly, Ra's has two of Batman's 'sons' with him: Damian Wayne and Jason Todd. Even more interestingly, collecting the 'Sons of the Bat' was one of the main goals of the Court of Owls. Jason even refers to Dick Grayson as ""Gray... Son..."" with an extremely emphasized pause. ""Gray Son"" was the Court's codename for Nightwing. Ra's already has a lot of similarities with the Court: He trains a small army of highly elite assassins, he's a mortal enemy of Batman, and he uses a mix of science and magic to resurrect the dead. It may very well be that he left the Light in order to ally with them, in order to bind the two groups into an alliance. He's shown in the past in Young Justice that he has a vendetta against Batman specifically, so a group dedicated to killing or capturing Batman would

Season 3 also hinted at a larger role for Batman and Gotham. They introduced Oracle, Spoiler, Arrowette, Orphan, Metamorpho, Katana, and Hardware. Almost none of these characters got much screentime or development though (besides Oracle), and they set up a large number of future plotlines: Barbara hasn't explained how she got in a wheelchair; Orphan's mother Lady Shiva is the Light's new enforcer; Tim Drake is still affected by the death of Jason Todd (now not so dead). It definitely seems like Season 4 will focus on Gotham, aka, the Court of Owls' home territory.

During Season 4, Shiva also mentions that the Light has planned a ""nuclear option"" to take down the League, murdering their children and families (Season 3 got fucking *dark*). The Court of Owls is shown to have a similar plan to this in the comics: Dozens of resurrected super-soldiers they call ""Talons"", who are sent out to murder hundreds of high profile targets in Gotham. The Light's backup plan might actually end up being the ""Night of Owls"".

lm0xj2,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"The Clone Wars: Palpatine gave Krell the 501st on purpose, in the hopes that he'd kill them allEven if Palpatine wasn't aware of Krell turning to the dark side, he knew that Krell had incredibly high casualty rates for his soldiers. If grunt clones are aware of that, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic definitely would. During the landing on Umbara, there's heavy enemy fire, and we see a number of clones die. Even with a skilled and compassionate general like Anakin leading them, Umbara was going to be an incredibly costly campaign. With Krell in charge, it would have been a bloodbath, and could easily have wiped out the entire 501st. We're told Palpatine made a personal request to bring back Anakin, and put Krell in charge. But why do that?

**Palpatine planned on using the death of the 501st to push Anakin further to the dark side.**

Think about the times Anakin gave in to the dark side: killing the Tuskens, joining the Brother, torturing Admiral Trench, Ahsoka's arrest, killing the younglings. All were motivated both by personal loss, and more importantly, feeling *powerless*. Powerless to stop his mother's death, powerless to change his fate, powerless to stop the bomb, powerless to save Ahsoka, powerless to save Padme. He's the Chosen One of the Force, with incredible powers that let him do basically anything he sets his mind to. So, when he runs into a situation where he can't control it, where all his power is useless, he just looks for *more* power, and turns to the dark side.

Ahsoka, Obi Wan, Padme, and R2 were some of the closest relationships Anakin had. But the clones were some of the closest things he had to a family. They were constantly in dangerous situations together, and Rex and the others saved Anakin's life on a number of occasions. They essentially took Anakin in as one of their brothers, and he showed them a massive amount of respect and friendship, much more than most Jedi generals did with their troops.

Imagine the feeling he'd have if hundreds of his closest friends, people who trusted in him, who put their lives in his hands all died because he wasn't there for them. Anakin is shown repeatedly blaming himself for things he has no control over, and this would be no different. In one fell swoop, Palpatine would have crushed Anakin, cut him off from emotional support, and pushed him further into anger and hate, likely wanting to take revenge against Krell.

**TL;DR: Pong Krell was meant to wipe out the 501st through his tactics, so that Palpatine could lure Anakin closer to the dark side.**",,,1613585958

lkkbfl,EquivalentInflation,The10thDentist,"Most of the criticisms of gay characters or relationships in movies or TV are just low-key homophobia.The most common complaint is ""they're so one note"" or ""being gay is their only personality trait"". All those people then seem to ignore the straight characters who do the exact same thing. The large majority of movie and TV romances aren't good, it's basically just ""Ah yes, guy and girl, you're gonna be together by the end."" Romance isn't easy to write, but it only ever gets brought up when the characters *aren't* straight. Just look at most action movies. What's Holly Genarro's personality? How does she grow as a person? No clue. She gets with John McClane. That's it. Not to mention that even even when they do get great development, people have crazy high standards, and still claim that they're bad.

Then there's ""Why are they in everything?"" Because LGBTQ people everywhere. A lot of TV shows feature American teenagers, one of the age groups with the highest rate of coming out, due to society becoming more accepting. So yes, when a movie features 10-15 kids in high school, odds are one is not straight. 

Of course, there's the good old ""Just write a good character, it doesn't matter if they're gay or not"". First off, again, there are just as many bad straight characters as gay ones. Second, it does matter. Look at Brooklyn 99. Captain Holt was a gay man in the NYPD in the '80s, when just a few years previously, the NYPD had been beating up gay protesters, of *course* that affected him. Ignoring sexuality doesn't make characters better, it makes them worse.

Finally, the classic ""If they're quality, I shouldn't know that they're gay."" Yes. Yes you should. That's how it works. Did anyone not know that Michael Scott was straight? Or Wolverine? When they say that, all they actually mean is ""I don't want to have to see gay people"".

lkgxmp,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Harry Potter: The Cursed Child was actually just a hit piece Rita Skeeter did on Harry's kids.Rita hated both Harry and Hermione with a passion for what she saw as destroying her career. Hermione blackmailed her into not writing for the Daily Prophet for a year or printing slander, under threat of revealing her identity as a secret animagus. After Rita broke that deal by helping Voldemort's ministry, it seems fair to say that Hermione would have alerted the world to Rita being a beetle animagus, especially after Hermione became Minister of Magic.

We saw how disheveled Rita was after less than a year of not being able to write, imagine over a decade of that. So, she decided to do what she did best, and destroy someone's life with slander. Harry's kids made the perfect target: We know she placed a lot of the blame on Harry himself as well as Hermione, and she had a habit of going after children with her articles. In addition, both Harry and Hermione were popular and successful in the Wizarding community. Any kind of lies she spread about them could be easily debunked in one of Hermione's daily press interviews. But about Harry's kids? That, she could do far more easily.

Her opportunity came when Albus was sorted into Slytherin, something that would likely provoke a lot of talk in the Wizarding community. It also would be something that most wizards and witches couldn't get direct evidence on, so it would be hard to disprove.

She had overheard their conversation on the train platform using her beetle form to hide among the noise and chaos, on the off chance she picked up some juicy piece of gossip. However, she likely couldn't make it into Hogwarts itself. There's some protections around the castle, and with McGonagall being the world's foremost expert on animagi, it seems reasonable that she'd have methods to keep other animagi out. So, after her one brief snippet of fact, she had to rely on fiction. That's why the story is so ridiculous, and why it breaks all known laws of the Harry Potter universe, as well as the characters acting completely differently than they ever had at any point in their lives.

It also was subtle enough slander that Harry and Hermione couldn't just refute it. If she argued Harry was a terrible Auror, he could show evidence to the contrary. But if she accused him of being a terrible father? That's something he can't really disprove. Skeeter portrayed him as being neglectful towards Albus, and causing his life to be miserable. She also wrote slander about Albus himself, painting him as dangerously reckless.

That's because I have no social life. This is gonna be kind of long, just skip to the bolded parts for a TL;DR)**

One thing that kinda bugged me reading the Harry Potter books was how *bad* the wizarding economy had to be. Think about it: All the typical expenses a person would have, like food, clothes, etc. would be reduced to almost nothing by magic. Yes, spells can't create food out of nowhere, or transfigure objects into food, but they *can* increase the size with ""engorgio"", or make exact copies of it with ""gemino"", or alter it into cooked food with an unnamed spell. If your clothes are too small, make them bigger! If there's a rip, use ""reparo"". Basically, all your needs can be met at a tiny cost. Minimum wage would let you live like a king.

We can even see that in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade: Nearly every store on their main streets, the areas with the most business, are all selling luxury goods. Quidditch brooms, magic candy, magic jokes, ice cream, pets, etc. Hogsmeade can be waved off as having a lot of schoolkids, but Diagon Alley is the center of Wizarding commerce in Britain. We see that there's one or two stores for clothes, the wand shop, the bookstore, the post office, the Quill shop (seriously.), and the apothecary; that's it for any kind of serious business in the two largest magical commercial centers in England. Half of those stores cater mainly to schoolkids, and probably don't do all that well for the rest of the year. Obviously, there's just the defense that Harry may have just have not paid attention to other stores, but think about it: What could they *actually* sell that wizards couldn't just make for themselves? The only successful shops are those selling either preparations for magic (books, potion ingredients, etc.), or those selling something that's fun, but not necessary enough that you'd put the time into learning it yourself.

**The Wizarding economy is largely based around luxury goods and basic materials, since they can fill most basic needs with magic.**

Let's take a look at the Weasleys: We know that they're considered poor by Wizarding standards, something that gets brought up a lot. Despite that, they manage to afford a very large house with a ton of open space, frequently have massive meals (to the point where Ron is unfamiliar with going hungry), and seem to still be able to provide relatively well for themselves. Ron complains about hand me downs, sure, but he has a decent amount of clothes, all of which are in good shape. Notably, when Mr. Weasley was attacked by the snake and sent to the hospital, they never once mentioned any kind of bill, despite constantly worrying over even small expenses. That suggests that wizards have some kind of free healthcare, likely sponsored by the Ministry. Despite how often they bring up the Weasleys being ""poor"", they'd probably be solidly middle class for us Muggles, and afford all that on a single bureaucrat's salary. The only actual differences in lifestyle for wealthy wizards seem to be wholly unnecessary and ostentatious.

Wealth and social class also seem to be relatively fixed. The wealthy pureblood families are all ""old money"", and we never see any of them doing much with it. Lucius Malfoy throws around cash on brooms and political bribes, with only some vague reference to ""business"" at one point to explain it. With unpaid servants, and little to no costs of living, a large fortune could turn into a multi-century affair, especially with marriage. When Fred and George wanted to start their business, they were unable to do so until Harry gave them a mountain of gold. From that, we can guess that starting a new business, even one with ready to sell merchandise and a proven market is near impossible, and that loans aren't a possibility (at least for lower class wizards). Look at Hogwarts: every class or career choice suggest students join up with an already existing job. They're not taught any skills that would allow them to start a business.

**The Wizarding world has very strictly set classes that are hard to break out of, however, their ""low class"" are still living extraordinarily comfortable lives.**

Then, there's the ministry. Think about it: isn't it a little... odd that the Ministry is so large? According to Pottermore, they have 3,000 citizens, 1/3 of whom are Hogwarts students, and are employing at least 20% of those, maybe even 30%, as well as paying for Hogwarts to be free, and likely, St. Mungos. So the total public sector (paid by the government, either directly or indirectly) is likely 40% to 50% of all adult wizards. They don't have streets to clean, public buildings to maintain (besides the one ministry building), or most other work a government would hire people for, yet they're hiring more than twice as many people as governments that *do* have those things. So somehow, they're paying for all that, with... what?

**The Ministry of Magic is hiring far more people than a normal government would, to do far less work. They also don't have the means to pay for that.**

**(You probably want to start reading here)**

Suspiciously, we see a lot of mentions of goblins meeting with Fudge and other ministry officials throughout the books. Luna may have been off on the pies side of it, but the fact remains that Fudge and the ministry definitely had ties to the goblin banks. Which is yet another odd thing: how does a bank that basically just acts as a glorified safety deposit box make money? We don't see them giving loans (Fred and George would likely have mentioned that), the Weasleys don't get interest on their deposit, and there's nothing for them to invest in.

So, how do they make cash?

**Goblins and the Ministry are conspiring to swindle Muggles by selling them magically duplicated gold and jewelry.**

We know that the spell ""Gemino"" creates two exact duplicates of an item that are indistinguishable by non magical means. The copy will decay or tarnish faster, but only over the course of months, leaving plenty of time. All they have to do is sell a few copies of gold bars to Muggles, maybe use a little confounding charm or memory wipe, and walk away with straight profit. Sure, they couldn't do it all at once, but a few bars to each bank in England, a few necklaces or chalices to each pawn shop, and you'd have millions in the course of a few weeks, all of which could be repeated due to the confused memories around the sale. Or, just take out a loan with magic duplicates as collateral. The goblins then provide a legitimate way to launder the money into galleons, and the Ministry makes sure no one catches wind of it.

Why all the secrecy though? Inflation. We see how little most wizards know about Muggles. Now imagine if you told them all that they could make mountains of gold scamming muggles with a relatively easy spell? You wouldn't even need gold or jewels, just find something like an Iphone, copy it, and make bank. The wizarding economy would be thrown into chaos, and it would likely end up exposing them. Mr. Weasley was panicking over a few toilets exploding, imagine if suddently, thousands of people started being approached by weirdos in capes and offered valuables, which then stopped working a few weeks later? With the banks, it could be brushed off. Multi-billion dollar banks likely wouldn't notice a few thousand dollars at a time, and the memory spells would cover their tracks if someone did. Even if banks figured it out, what are they going to say? Somebody sold us gold, and now it disappeared, and also we have no clue what they look like? But with thousands of cases like that, most of which would be done by amateur wizards...

Likely, it was only a few top ministry wizards and goblins who knew about it, with a few discreet ministry agents doing the dirty work. The ministry kept afloat, the goblins skimmed a little off the top, and everyone went home happy.

**TL;DR: The Ministry conspired with goblins to sell Muggles fake gold, then launder the money through Gringotts.**",,,1613326691

ljt9eu,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Thor Love and Thunder: Jane Foster won't be the one to pick up the hammer, Valkyrie will.The fourth Thor movie has been confirmed to feature Mjolnir in some way, although it's currently unknown exactly how. New Asgard *is* located right by the spot where the hammer was broken, and since Eitri, the dwarf who made it was introduced, it might be able to be reforged.

No matter how it ends up, someone besides Thor is going to end up wielding the hammer. Currently, Natalie Portman has been confirmed to be in the movie, and many people theorize that she'll take up the hammer in the same way that she did in the comics. However, that's just a red herring.

**Mjolnir's true owner will be Valkyrie, the current king of Asgard.**

Tessa Thompson has already been confirmed to be playing a major role in the movie. She also has received far more MCU development than Jane Foster, as well as doing so far more recently. Jane showed up in the first two Thor movies, as well as a brief cameo in Endgame. She didn't really ever develop or overcome things, and instead, functioned either as Thor's love interest, and briefly, a plot point when she had an Infinity Stone. Valkyrie, on the other hand, played a large role in both Ragnarok and Endgame. She also had a far more compelling backstory, which is likely going to be built on more in the movie. Portman also left the MCU, and didn't wish to continue it, while Thompson has already signed a contract for more movies. It has been a lot of time, and Portman may have changed her mind, but it wouldn't be a great call on Marvel's part to get a major character played by an actress who might not come back for more movies. Finally, Valkyrie is far less expected to wield the hammer than Jane. Taika Waititi has a history of altering storylines from the comics for better surprise, like having both Thor and Loki survive Ragnarok. So, from a meta perspective, Valkyrie seems like the obvious choice. 

It also makes sense in-universe. The definition of ""worthy"" has always been a bit vague, but it seemed to be connected to personal sacrifice. Thor was willing to die to defend others, giving him back his powers. Cap sacrificed himself a ton, and was willing to take on Thanos alone to save Thor, giving him the ability to wield the hammer. Obviously, there's more to it than just that, Tony wasn't able to pick it up, but it's certainly related to selflessness. Valkyrie certainly has the potential to pick up the hammer. She lived in exile for years, after nearly dying at the hands of Hela during the Valkyrie massacre. Despite that, she put aside her selfishness and sacrificed the life she had built in order to go rescue Asgardians. She then fought to defend them from Thanos, and when that failed, brought the survivors to Earth. There, without help from Thor, she managed to build New Asgard from the ground up. We saw her in Endgame helping do everyday, menial work, showing her humility and dedication. At the end of the movie, Thor named her the king of Asgard, with the responsibility of protecting its citizens. Meanwhile, Jane has... what? She accepted her death once, during Dark World, but more because she couldn't escape from under the ship in time than a sacrifice. She's certainly by no means a bad person, but if Tony Stark, who was willing to die (and technically did for a few seconds) couldn't lift it, how could she? Valkyrie also has far more motivation to lift Mjolnir and take on Thor's power. She has her kingdom to protect, something she was unable to do once, and swore to never do again. She currently is in charge of New Asgard, and was personally entrusted the role of defending it by Thor. Jane on the other hand has no real reason to wield Thor's power.

It's also nothing new for Marvel to take elaborate steps to avoid spoilers. Michael Rooker played Yondu, who died in Guardians of the Galaxy 2. When spoilers about his death started spreading before the movie's release, Marvel paid him to show up on the set of Infinity War in full costume and makeup, and ""leaked"" photos of him there. If they were willing to go to all that effort to avoid spoiling the death of a minor character, how much more would they do to cover up the identity of a major new hero, that will likely play a big role in the future of the MCU?

**TL;DR: Jane Foster appearing is a red herring, to cover up that Valkyrie will take up Mjolnir. The sacrifices she's made, and her personality would allow her to pick up the hammer far better.**",,,1613324944
lj7nlj,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"WandaVision: Wanda was trying to give Monica powers, as a way to take herself (Wanda) downIt's been speculated ever since Monica first appeared in Captain Marvel that she was going to gain powers like in the comics. Those speculations only grew stronger after she appeared in Wandavision.

Now, with the most recent episode, it seems like it's happening: Going through the hex barrier, Monica's cells were rewritten, and are changing into something new.

In the comics, her powers involved near complete control of different forms of energy, including the ability to shift her body into different wavelengths. Doing so notably makes her invulnerable to any psychic attack, as well as being able to absorb and redirect energy blasts, and phase through physical attacks. 

Those powers make her the perfect person to take down Wanda. Her phase shifting would allow her to get through the hex (Darcy even gave her the exact type of wave: CMBR). She then wouldn't be affected by Wanda's mind control, or the hex's time-warp. Finally, Wanda wouldn't be able to physically grab her with her powers like before, and doing so would actually make Monica *more* powerful. Her attacks also are essentially instantaneous, so even Wanda's advanced reflexes couldn't manage to hold her off for long. Finally, her energy powers allow her to be incredibly precise taking Wanda down, with no risk of civilian casualties. 

Throughout the show, we've been shown that there's a part of the old Wanda still beneath the surface. That's how Monica managed to get so close to her without being detected, and why she arrived *just* when needed, as well as how she was cushioned when Wanda yote her out. Monica even says as much to Wanda herself. In addition, Monica would be the only person Wanda could trust to take the shot if necessary. SWORD obviously has some shady shit going on, and Vision, while not directly under her control, is very close to it, and she's able to beat him in a fight. Whatever subconscious part of Wanda exists, it recognizes what a danger she has become, and wants to have a contingency plan available. 

**TL;DR: Wanda subconsciously gave Monica the exact powers needed in order to take down Wanda, either lethally or just to knock her unconscious. Part of her wants to protect people, and trusts Monica to make the right call.**",,,1613245600
limblb,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"WandaVision: The ""special guest star"" was trying to kill himself.Throughout the new episode, Pietro's behavior seemed... off. He kept purposefully antagonizing Wanda in order to try and anger her. Some of it was just stereotypical sitcom brother stuff, but some of it also was incredibly personal, and involved him directly addressing the real world, and accusing her of controlling everything, something that usually caused her to fly into a rage. 

Pietro is dead. Vision at least could be somewhat resurrected because some of his programming survived, but Pietro is full on, heart stopped, six feet under *dead*. However, as we know, Wanda can warp reality to bring him back. Despite her powers though, Pietro knows he was dead, and naturally wants to return to that. We saw how much mental agony Monica, Agnes and Norm were in just from being mind controlled by Wanda. Wanda's powers can manipulate reality, but reality will always try and fix itself, essentially creating a constant tug-of-war for their minds.

Now, if there's that much pain just in taking someone's free will, imagine the pain someone would be in if they physically were torn out of death and thrust back into the living world. Every cell of Pietro's body, every neuron in his brain constantly wants to die, but Wanda keeps them together, creating a life of constant torture for him.

That's why he antagonizes Wanda. He tries to ruin her Halloween episode with pranks, and getting her sons to misbehave; he talks about their dead parents and his own death; he needles her about the townspeople, and tries to stir her guilty conscience; and finally, he reminds her of reality, both by questioning how she got there, and mocking Vision's death, which may have finally let him achieve his goal.",,,1613168458

The most recent episode explains that Wanda had somehow learned magic in order to survive (from the ad), as well as the fact that *she didn't know how she got there*. So, there was some crazy event right before the show where Wanda would have gained a knowledge of magic, which also severely affected her mind.

And what have we been *explicitly* told causes insanity and losing one's mind? Improper magic. 

What likely happened was that Wanda went to Strange seeking help. Possibly, she realized that she was in a bad place, or she wanted to learn more about her powers.

lilogl,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"DC: Batman DOES attract criminals to Gotham... on purposeOne of the biggest fan criticisms of Batman is that he ends up making his own worst enemies, and draws villains in towards him like a magnet. It's gotten so big that even the movies and comics mention it. The Joker even says that the only reason he's there is because of Batman, and that he's like ""a dog chasing it's own tail"". All of that serves to make Gotham even *more* dangerous than it might be otherwise.

**Batman knows that he's a magnet for supervillains, which he does in order to gather them all in one place.**

Imagine that you're a regular cop in a random city, let's say St. Louis, and all of a sudden, a lunatic with clown face paint uses a chemical gas on hundreds of civilians. You'd be panicking, and have no clue what to do. But for the Gotham police, that's just Tuesday. They get so used to supervillains being around that they start to develop procedures for specific villains. It also means that villains don't have shock value on their side. By consolidating all the villains in one area, and working with the police, Batman can create one, specialized force to deal with supervillains. If he weren't around, all those criminals would disperse across the country, to attack far less prepared cities.

It also gives Batman a chance to do the same. We know that he has contingency plans for all of the villains, as well as having developed ways to neutralize a lot of them. He gives himself shots that lessen Scarecrow's fear gas, creates pesticides specifically for Poison Ivy, etc. The Injustice comics start with the idea that the Joker decides to go after Superman instead of Batman. In one fell swoop, Joker manages to trick Superman into killing both Lois Lane, and his unborn daughter, as well as triggering a nuke in Metropolis, wiping out the city. Remember, that wasn't a Joker with extra powers, or increased planning. That was just Joker dealing with someone besides Batman. It's easy to blame Batman for dealing poorly with the Joker, when in reality, he's actually one of the few people capable of understanding Joker well enough to counter him.

In addition, having those supercriminals there helped to make the GCPD less corrupt. When Batman first arrived, they made a point of showing that Jim Gordon was the only good cop, with maybe a few others. Now, it's flipped. Sure, they have a few dirty cops to spice up a storyline now and then, but most of the time, GCPD is efficient and above board. That's because someone like the Joker or Bane isn't going to bother trying to bribe anyone, and if they do, it's part of a mind game that will end up with that cop dead. The only one who did so was the Penguin, who had been a mob boss long before Batman ever showed up. It also makes crooked cops less likely to want to be in Gotham. Before, you could have a job with almost zero risk, that paid a ton. After, you were in a ton of danger, getting paid very little money. The only people actually willing to work that job would be those that legitimately believed in it.

Villains also tend to be extremely egotistical and territorial, causing them to spend much of their time attacking each other instead of civilians. Think about all the different grudges they hold: Harley Quinn is obsessed with killing Joker, which Poison Ivy wants to help her with; Penguin has a score with Catwoman over the jewels she stole from him, etc. The War of Jokes and Riddles even focused exactly on that, Joker and Riddler collecting armies of villains to fight each other over who got to kill Batman. While there were civilian casualties, there were far less so than if those same armies had just decided to take over the city, which they easily could have done.

Finally, it also gives villains a chance to direct their hatred at Batman himself. He's willing to sacrifice his own well being to be their target, their punching bag. Imagine what Riddler could do if he wasn't obsessed with sending Batman notes about his crimes in advance, or if Joker just decided to poison the reservoir *without* driving around in a giant clown shaped boat? Their obsession with Batman causes them to do their best to destroy him, distracting them from their vast, untapped potential for chaos. Riddler even tells him that ""I keep you alive for the same reason that we *all* keep you alive. You're that first riddle you hear when you're a child. That you return to as an adult, though you know the answer. You're not a challenge. But you're *fun*."" In some dark, twisted way, all of Batman's villains need him, as a focus for their anger and violence.

Batman is well known for making some... dark decisions. The man created elaborate murder plans for all his best friends, as well as his adopted children. He often makes decisions that would seem immoral for any other hero, but are necessary in his eyes to prevent a greater evil. He collects dozens of villains who otherwise could be extremely successful, and lures them in to Gotham. That way, rather than having tens of thousands of potential deaths, millions of dollars stolen or destroyed, and entire cities wiped out, the damage can be limited. Gotham was already a crime filled city, and Batman's villains actually ended up inadvertently helping with some of that, taking out mob families, and helping clean up the police.  In Batman's pragmatic eyes, it was the perfect solution: The world stayed safe, and Gotham was already bad enough that it didn't matter much (and actually made it a bit better in some ways).

**TL;DR: Batman knows he draws villains into Gotham, and is OK with that, because by concentrating all the villains in one spot, he can limit their damage, and spare the rest of the world.**",,,1613166567
lil1m1,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Harry Potter: Sybil Trelawney was actually a very good seer, but faked it to protect herself.In Order of the Phoenix, we find out that Trelawney had made the prophecy that involved Harry and Voldemort. In Prisoner of Azkaban, she correctly predicts the return of Pettigrew. Finally, in Half Blood Prince, she predicts Dumbledore's death, saying that great tragedy is about to occur on a tower, and a great betrayal. But, she states that she does not remember the first two, and is drunk when she gives the last. She also shows a moderate amount of skill predicting minor details, that Neville would break a teacup, that Umbridge would soon meet a terrible fate, etc. There also was a recent post, showing how, when she read Harry's palm, she correctly interpreted Voldemort's birth date.

**The reason Trelawney can do all these things, while also making a number of predictions that are either purposefully vague or completely fake, is because she is trying to cover up her abilities.** Trelawney can remember her prophecies, but chooses to act as if she doesn't, because she is afraid of the possible results. Voldemort spent a full year trying to take the prophecy from the Hall of Mysteries, if he thought there was the slightest chance she might have it, she would be kidnapped and tortured for information. Information is the most powerful key to power, and if word got out that Trelawney was capable of reliably predicting information, everyone would want her, the Order, Voldemort, the Ministry, and any wizard with money or ambitions. So, Trelawney covers it up. She makes obviously false predictions, dresses up, and in general, acts like a massive fake. Then, when a prophecy slips out every now and then, people will think she's just lucky. Both Dumbledore and McGonagall already had negative views of Divination, so it was easy to make them think she was just another fake.

We can see that Trelawney is a true seer in books 5 and 6. Trelawney loses her job for a bit under Umbridge, then has her classes cut in half by Firenze. She is mocked, and publicly humiliated for her supposed lack of future telling abilities. This is what drives her to drinking and depression, because she knows that she could have fame, wealth and respect if she chose. She knows that she could easily pass Umbridge's exam, and that she could be publicly respected, but is forced to stay in hiding. Think Mr. Incredible at the start of his movie. Imagine knowing everything, yet not being able to tell anyone. In that way, she's similar to the prophetess Cassandra (coincidentally, her great-grandmother's name). The Harry Potter books include a lot of allusions to mythology, and this is another one: a seer who no one will believe.

lhqfxt,EquivalentInflation,harrypotter,"The scene in Chamber of Secrets when Mrs. Weasley tells Harry to eat hits way differently now.The first time through, I just kind of interpreted it as Mrs. Weasley's general motherliness, in the same way a grandma will tell you you're too skinny after feeding you three giant helpings of food.

But rereading it, I realized that she wasn't just worrying over nothing, Harry had been starved for weeks. The Dursleys were giving him the bare minimum of food, and what they were giving him (like cold canned soup that was mostly broth) had no real nutritious value. Harry mentions that he had been spending most of his time lying around on his bed and sleeping, probably because he didn't have the energy to do much else.

The book describes Mrs. Weasley as being incredibly angry, right up until one of the twins mentions they had been starving Harry. When she then takes a second to actually see what bad shape Harry is in, almost all of the anger goes out of her. She's still a bit strict with the boys, but nowhere near as furious as she had been. We know Mrs. Weasley specialized in healing magic as well as cooking, and likely recognized all the signs of malnutrition in Harry. When she then monitors Harry as he's eating, and keeps giving him more, it's not a joke, it's because that's likely the first real meal he's had since he left Hogwarts.

Finally, during the conversation and meal, she makes a point of letting Harry know she's not angry with *him* when she starts yelling, and then constantly gives Harry praise and positive reinforcement. In short, she's following the textbook guide for dealing with victims of abuse, and getting them settled into a safer place.

I just thought it was a truly nice moment that showed an adult actually being responsible and caring for Harry's emotional and physical well being, something that he had only experienced once or twice previously.",,,1613066447

He had to follow them and monitor them, meaning he saw e*xactly* how they had been treating Harry. When he busted down the door, what was the first thing he saw? Harry lying on the cold, hard floor, shivering in worn and tattered clothes. 

We don't know exactly what role he played in the Order, but it's mentioned that it was ""hard to trust people at the time"", and that people who did trust each other had to stick very close. He was shown once bursting into tears just at the mention of Lily and James, something he didn't do for his father, mother, or any other Order member, even those who had just died like Moody. The only person he showed the same emotion for was Dumbledore, which shows how much he cared about them. Now imagine having people you truly cared about, people who likely saved your life more than once, some of the few people in the world who know who you are and still respect you. Imagine that those people die, and you're sent to meet their son. The first thing you see is that he looks just like your old friend. The second is that he's miserable, living in hell. He's being denied food, warm clothes, and and kind of love or affection. By then, you're holding in your anger, trying not to break a vital law that's been drilled into you since birth, when the same asshole who abused Harry insults the person you respect and admire most in the world.

That's because I have no social life. This is gonna be kind of long, just skip to the bolded parts for a TL;DR)**

One thing that kinda bugged me reading the Harry Potter books was how *bad* the wizarding economy had to be. Think about it: All the typical expenses a person would have, like food, clothes, etc. would be reduced to almost nothing by magic. Yes, spells can't create food out of nowhere, or transfigure objects into food, but they *can* increase the size with ""engorgio"", or make exact copies of it with ""gemino"", or alter it into cooked food with an unnamed spell. If your clothes are too small, make them bigger! If there's a rip, use ""reparo"". Basically, all your needs can be met at a tiny cost. Minimum wage would let you live like a king.

We can even see that in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade: Nearly every store on their main streets, the areas with the most business, are all selling luxury goods. Quidditch brooms, magic candy, magic jokes, ice cream, pets, etc. Hogsmeade can be waved off as having a lot of schoolkids, but Diagon Alley is the center of Wizarding commerce in Britain. We see that there's one or two stores for clothes, the wand shop, the bookstore, the post office, the Quill shop (seriously.), and the apothecary; that's it for any kind of serious business in the two largest magical commercial centers in England. Half of those stores cater mainly to schoolkids, and probably don't do all that well for the rest of the year. Obviously, there's just the defense that Harry may have just have not paid attention to other stores, but think about it: What could they *actually* sell that wizards couldn't just make for themselves? The only successful shops are those selling either preparations for magic (books, potion ingredients, etc.), or those selling something that's fun, but not necessary enough that you'd put the time into learning it yourself.

**The Wizarding economy is largely based around luxury goods and basic materials, since they can fill most basic needs with magic.**

Let's take a look at the Weasleys: We know that they're considered poor by Wizarding standards, something that gets brought up a lot. Despite that, they manage to afford a very large house with a ton of open space, frequently have massive meals (to the point where Ron is unfamiliar with going hungry), and seem to still be able to provide relatively well for themselves. Ron complains about hand me downs, sure, but he has a decent amount of clothes, all of which are in good shape. Notably, when Mr. Weasley was attacked by the snake and sent to the hospital, they never once mentioned any kind of bill, despite constantly worrying over even small expenses. That suggests that wizards have some kind of free healthcare, likely sponsored by the Ministry. Despite how often they bring up the Weasleys being ""poor"", they'd probably be solidly middle class for us Muggles, and afford all that on a single bureaucrat's salary. The only actual differences in lifestyle for wealthy wizards seem to be wholly unnecessary and ostentatious.

Wealth and social class also seem to be relatively fixed. The wealthy pureblood families are all ""old money"", and we never see any of them doing much with it. Lucius Malfoy throws around cash on brooms and political bribes, with only some vague reference to ""business"" at one point to explain it. With unpaid servants, and little to no costs of living, a large fortune could turn into a multi-century affair, especially with marriage. When Fred and George wanted to start their business, they were unable to do so until Harry gave them a mountain of gold. From that, we can guess that starting a new business, even one with ready to sell merchandise and a proven market is near impossible, and that loans aren't a possibility (at least for lower class wizards). Look at Hogwarts: every class or career choice suggest students join up with an already existing job. They're not taught any skills that would allow them to start a business.

**The Wizarding world has very strictly set classes that are hard to break out of, however, their ""low class"" are still living extraordinarily comfortable lives.**

Then, there's the ministry. Think about it: isn't it a little... odd that the Ministry is so large? According to Pottermore, they have 3,000 citizens, 1/3 of whom are Hogwarts students, and are employing at least 20% of those, maybe even 30%, as well as paying for Hogwarts to be free, and likely, St. Mungos. So the total public sector (paid by the government, either directly or indirectly) is likely 40% to 50% of all adult wizards. They don't have streets to clean, public buildings to maintain (besides the one ministry building), or most other work a government would hire people for, yet they're hiring more than twice as many people as governments that *do* have those things. So somehow, they're paying for all that, with... what?

**The Ministry of Magic is hiring far more people than a normal government would, to do far less work. They also don't have the means to pay for that.**

**(You probably want to start reading here)**

Suspiciously, we see a lot of mentions of goblins meeting with Fudge and other ministry officials throughout the books. Luna may have been off on the pies side of it, but the fact remains that Fudge and the ministry definitely had ties to the goblin banks. Which is yet another odd thing: how does a bank that basically just acts as a glorified safety deposit box make money? We don't see them giving loans (Fred and George would likely have mentioned that), the Weasleys don't get interest on their deposit, and there's nothing for them to invest in.

So, how do they make cash?

**Goblins and the Ministry are conspiring to swindle Muggles by selling them magically duplicated gold and jewelry.**

We know that the spell ""Gemino"" creates two exact duplicates of an item that are indistinguishable by non magical means. The copy will decay or tarnish faster, but only over the course of months, leaving plenty of time. All they have to do is sell a few copies of gold bars to Muggles, maybe use a little confounding charm or memory wipe, and walk away with straight profit. Sure, they couldn't do it all at once, but a few bars to each bank in England, a few necklaces or chalices to each pawn shop, and you'd have millions in the course of a few weeks, all of which could be repeated due to the confused memories around the sale. Or, just take out a loan with magic duplicates as collateral. The goblins then provide a legitimate way to launder the money into galleons, and the Ministry makes sure no one catches wind of it.

Why all the secrecy though? Inflation. We see how little most wizards know about Muggles. Now imagine if you told them all that they could make mountains of gold scamming muggles with a relatively easy spell? You wouldn't even need gold or jewels, just find something like an Iphone, copy it, and make bank. The wizarding economy would be thrown into chaos, and it would likely end up exposing them. Mr. Weasley was panicking over a few toilets exploding, imagine if suddently, thousands of people started being approached by weirdos in capes and offered valuables, which then stopped working a few weeks later? With the banks, it could be brushed off. Multi-billion dollar banks likely wouldn't notice a few thousand dollars at a time, and the memory spells would cover their tracks if someone did. Even if banks figured it out, what are they going to say? Somebody sold us gold, and now it disappeared, and also we have no clue what they look like? But with thousands of cases like that, most of which would be done by amateur wizards...

Likely, it was only a few top ministry wizards and goblins who knew about it, with a few discreet ministry agents doing the dirty work. The ministry kept afloat, the goblins skimmed a little off the top, and everyone went home happy.

lh42ae,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Star Wars: Jedi become more powerful by accepting their deathDeath, and coming to terms with it has been a major theme in Star Wars. The Jedi greet it and accept it, while the Sith seek to cheat it. However, many Jedi also avoid death throughout the series, even in cases where their sacrifice might be required by the force.

This also fits well with our understanding of the force. Yoda states ""Do or do not, there is no try"". A Jedi must commit themselves fully to something in order to succeed, and how much more committed than you get than giving up your own life?

It also fits the symbolism of the series pretty well, as well as Palpatine's story: He rose to power because Yoda wasn't willing to die, and retreated. He then was defeated by Vader sacrificing his life, and later by Rey sacrificing hers. Palpatine's entire motivation was trying to gain immortality, protecting his own life, and the only way to defeat him was to give up one's life. It's like poetry... it rhymes.

Let's run through some examples:

* Obi Wan Kenobi
   * Obviously, the biggest example of this. He gives in to Darth Vader, and even states that he ""Will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine"". By accepting death like a Jedi, he manages to become a force ghost successfully, something no Jedi had ever done (Qui Gon only got halfway).
* Qui Gon Jinn
   * We see Qui Gon sit down and meditate shortly before his death. In this moment, he likely realized that he'd die, using his precognition. By accepting that calmly, he managed to help save Obi Wan (Maul *should* have been fast enough to cut him in half, but he flew up far faster, almost like someone used the force to pull him...). He also managed to become a partial force ghost, but didn't understand the technique well enough.
* Kanan Jarrus
   * Kanan knew about his death ahead of time, and was warned by the Lothwolves. However, he still continued on in his quest to protect others, even at the cost of his own life, fulfilling the Jedi code. He then gained enough power to hold back a massive explosion, an incredible feat of strength and force ability.
* Ahsoka Tano
   * When Ahsoka was saved by Ezra using the World Between Worlds, she seemed surprised, and momentarily wondered if she was dead. She went into the fight with Vader with no hope of survival, but only a desire, however unlikely, to save Anakin. Despite her statements, she was a true Jedi. The last time Ahsoka fought a Sith was Maul, who beat her in a duel, while she managed to trick him. Vader is far, far more powerful, yet she goes toe to toe with him, and even manages to injure him.
* Yoda (RotS)
   * Yoda fighting against Palpatine is the perfect example of this failing. When trying to hold back Palpatine's lightning, Yoda fails, and falls to the Senate floor, and then makes his escape. In that moment, Yoda felt fear, and thought first of his own life, causing him to lose. That's why he's so ashamed afterwards, and why he cuts himself off from the galaxy: He had a shot to save everyone, but failed, due to his own flaws.
* Yoda (RotJ)
   * Yoda's actual death however allows him to become a force ghost, an impressive feat only Obi Wan had managed. He lets go of his worries, and lets himself die, without a 100% guarantee he'll be a ghost. That shows how much he'd grown since RotJ, and how he'd finally cast off his faults to embrace the Jedi philosphy.
* Anakin
   * Anakin is interesting, since he shows both the Sith and Jedi views. In RotS, he refuses to let himself die, holding on by sheer force of will, like a Sith. He's afraid of what comes next, and avoids it at all costs. However, in RotJ, he finally lets go of that, and accepts his death in order to save his son, gaining the power to not just defeat Palpatine, but to become a force ghost with no training.
* Ezra Bridger
   * Ezra chooses to sacrifice himself in order to remove Thrawn. He may have survived, but the chance he took was incredibly risky, and death was a very likely possibility. His sacrifice let him interact with the Purrgil, as well as making sure Thrawn didn't escape, and the Empire couldn't react in time.
* Luke Skywalker
   * Luke sacrifices himself saving Leia and the Resistance. He finally accepts the Jedi code, after years of denying it, just in time to trade his life for theirs. He manages to not only force project across the entire galaxy, but to become a force ghost after.
* Rey
   * When Rey is dueling Kylo Ren on Starkiller base, she's losing for the first half of the fight. He keeps driving her back, and she's filled with fear. However, she then takes a moment to pause, and breathe, calming herself, after which, she manages to push Kylo back and defeat him. Chewie was coming in to their area, and would be able to rescue Finn, so she planned on sacrificing herself to distract Kylo long enough for Chewie to save Finn. She then planned a similar sacrifice on Exegol to defeat Palpatine",,,1612991604
lh24ar,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"WandaVision: Mordo is the one manipulating Wanda, and he's using the Mirror Dimension to create Westview.I've seen 14 million different theories on how Mephisto might be manipulating Wanda, but surprisingly, not one about a massive magical villain we've already been introduced to: Mordo.

At the end of Dr. Strange, we see that Mordo has become disillusioned due to the Ancient One's lies, and believes that there are ""too many sorcerers"". He then attacks Pangborn, a low level magician, and strips his magic away through an unexplained process. Given that we see hundreds of sorcerers in Endgame, and Mordo is never mentioned, it seems fair to say that he was disintegrated in the Snap, or was inactive for some reason.

Wanda's powers have always been vaguely defined, but they definitely seem to be at least partly magical, in the same way Strange's are. She even uses twisting hand motions similarly to Strange, Kaecilius, etc. We don't have a hard definition of magic in the MCU (I refuse to acknowledge Thor's ""mAgIc Is JuSt ScIeNcE wE dOn'T uNdErStAnD""), but it seems fair to say that Wanda's powers would at least partially count, especially considering she harnessed the power of an infinity stone like Strange. From the little we learned in Dr. Strange, we know that there's his type of magic, requiring books, study, specific movements, etc., or the magic used by someone like Pangborn that's more instinct and belief based (like Wanda). She's also mirrors almost the exact issue that caused Mordo's shift in belief: someone using the power of an infinity stone to alter reality in ways that break natural laws. She'd be one of the most high profile targets he could take down. 

Let's look at the exact details on Westview that we know of: It's releasing cosmic particles that have no place being on Earth, and are incredibly rare. It doesn't obey our laws of time. It's day when Monica is thrown out, yet night outside. The wall calendar in the first episode shows August, but then skips ahead. It can also be manipulated and shaped by a skilled magician who breaks natural laws. All of those fit the mirror dimension perfectly. 

Mordo at the moment is a bit of a twisted anti-hero. He legitimately wants to save the world, but he has no goal besides wiping out sorcerers, and no real moral compass besides that. He wants to protect the Earth, so he sends Wanda into the mirror dimension, but he's also willing to risk the lives of civilians trapped in there. He doesn't care about individuals, just the Earth as a whole.

However, he didn't just kill her or take her powers, suggesting that there's something more to it. It's possible that she's just more powerful than him, and he's biding his time. However, it may be that he wants her for something more. His own statements in Dr. Strange parallel very well with Wanda's own ""No more mutants"", and it may be that he wants to use her to wipe out sorcerers all at once using her power.

We also know that there are a number of rogue sorcerers in the MCU-- not a lot, but certainly enough that Mordo could find one, like, say, Agatha Harkness, aka, Agnes.",,,1612986711
lgzpbf,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Mandalorian: The Empire committed the Great Mandalorian Purge using the Blue Shadow VirusWe don't know a lot about ""The Great Purge"" so far. All that we do know is that it killed the large majority of Mandalorians, and left the planet uninhabitable. However, we can make some logical inferences from what we do know. When Bo Katan is talking about retaking Mandalore, she never mentions any kind of preparation for radiation or anything of the sort. From that, we can presume that whatever the Imperials used, it wasn't permanent. In addition, the client pays Mando in beskar, taken from dead Mandalorians, and he implies that the Empire used to have far more. So, whatever method was used allowed the Empire to gather a decent number of corpses, without them being blown apart like a nuke might have. Finally, we know that there were scattered survivors, so whatever it was, it wasn't total annihilation, and there was likely time for people to escape. However, none of those escapees were organized or united, meaning that there was likely a state of chaos, and that there were small groups escaping from each city alone.

It also seems fair to say that a straight up invasion would have been nearly impossible. The Mandalorians were born warriors, with near indestructible armor, and centuries of experience waging war. Even just small groups of twenty or thirty were shown to be capable of wiping out small armies of Imperials. In Mandalorian, roughly a dozen adult mandalorians can wipe out a small army of bounty hunters, and manage to hold off large amounts of stormtroopers, all *without* beskar armor. Suffice to say, if the Empire had to fight thousands of soldiers on that level, it would be disastrously bloody for them.

In the Clone Wars, the Separtists develop an airborne version of the Blue Shadow virus, which is then captured by the Republic. The same Republic controlled by Palpatine, someone who would be *very* interested in a virus capable of wiping out entire planets. The *Rebel Files* book confirms that the Empire still had it, when a Rebel Intelligence officer mentioned it as a major threat that could be used against them.

Mandalorians almost all lived in giant domed cities, after the surface of their planet became uninhabitable. They all lived close together, and notably, all used one major source of water per city. The original version of the Virus was waterborne, and the second version was airborne. In either case, it would be relatively simple for the Empire to infect entire cities all at once, either through subterfuge, treachery, or a concentrated attack, with thousands of people dying in just a few days. The Virus was designed to be the ultimate bio-weapon, spreading incredibly fast, and killing 96% of its victims 48 hours after infection. If it could ""infect entire planets in days"" as claimed, how long to infect just one city? Any cure would be impossible; it took two of the top Jedi in the galaxy to find the specific cure on a deadly planet, *with* information on exactly what they were looking for. All they could do was wait for death. However, that still would leave time for a few alert people to get out; the refugees shown in the Mandalorian.

That's also likely why Mando mentions most Mandalorians feel that the planet is cursed. Imagine watching your family, as well as everyone you've ever known or loved slowly turn to grey and die in horrible agony as their veins pushed closer to the surface of the skin. It seems fair to say that talk about a ""curse"" might be understandable in that situation.",,,1612980557
lgzmuk,EquivalentInflation,unpopularopinion,"Tumblr isn't anywhere as near as bad as Reddit actsYeah, it's got it's assholes, *just like Reddit.* Are there definitely people there who fit the ""super woke"" stereotype to a ridiculous degree? Absolutely. But again, if we judge them all by those few, we have to be prepared to judge Reddit the same way, and given the really depressing number of people I've met on this site denying the Armenian Genocide, I don't want to start that argument. 

In general, it's also better than Reddit for stuff like artwork, or fan-made content, since a post from a day ago and a month ago can both show up together. You don't need to worry anywhere near as much about dying in new, which means that a lot of the people who put legitimate effort into stuff try to post there. It also tends to be better for fan communities. There's always a few fandoms that are toxic, but for stuff like Star Wars, it tends to be way more positive than Reddit.

lgzby8,EquivalentInflation,rant,"Hollywood is equally horrible for everyoneI see a ton of people complaining that Hollywood has it out for men, or white people, always with the same few examples. ""Just tweet something wrong and your life is over"" ""If a guy did this, he'd be fired"".

But let's take another look.

* Mark Wahlberg admitted to viciously beating an elderly asian man and calling him racial slurs when he was younger, and spent time in jail for it. Nothing happened to him.
* Robert Downey Jr. wore blackface for a full movie. Nothing happened to him.
* JK Rowling wrote a goddamn TERF manifesto. She's still making bank and producing several movies, a TV show, and a video game.
* Kevin Hart was ""canceled"" for homophobic tweets. He has had no real negative impacts on his career, besides not hosting the Oscars, which... c'mon. It's not the position it used to be.
* Johnny Depp, one of Reddit's favorite examples is still making bank, involved in numerous ad campaigns and movies.

The fact is, **Hollywood doesn't give a damn about anyone.** Paul Rudd could murder 27 people, and they'd still be willing to hire him. Public outcry changes basically nothing. Harvey Weinstein, while he was out on bail spent time with some of the heads of the movie industry. These people would burn down an orphanage made of puppies for fun. They only pretend to care if there's a *really* big spotlight put on them, then rehire the person when everyone moves on.

So stop having a victim complex or complaining, and embrace the fact that EVERYONE sucks equally.",,,1612979633
lgz5kr,EquivalentInflation,StarWarsBattlefront,"EA made the right choice FROM AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVEFirst off: It sucks. I loved this game, I would have loved to see more from it. I'm also not a huge EA fan for a number of reasons. However, I've seen a ton of people on this sub who seem to have no clue how this works, so I want to set the record straight by addressing a few common misconceptions.

""**The game is still selling great, long after release. EA is stupid for stopping support, when so many people want to buy the game""**

Yes. It's awesome. But that's not how economics work. All the people buying it did so with full knowledge that they would *not* be getting updates. In order to justify an update, EA would have to get enough people to buy the game *solely because of that update*. Let's go with some common requests for an example: EA releases a Coruscant map, with Ahsoka and Ventress as playable heroes. We're just going to say that costs $1,000 in dev salaries, software, etc. ( I know that's nowhere near realistic, this is all made up). EA would have to find enough people who decide to buy it *only* because of this update. Let's just imagine then that they earn $1,100 from that. In addition, they'd have to compare that profit to other potential profits. Maybe by spending that $1,000 worth of dev work on Battlefield, they could earn $1,200. The sad fact is, Battlefront II is a game long after its release. Most of the people buying it now didn't just find out about it, they're either new to gaming, or didn't want it enough to pay full price, so they waited.

**""EA is trying to ruin the game by making it free with Epic Games""**

This one is so stupid it hurts my brain. Of all the things you can accuse EA of, not wanting to make money isn't one. EA isn't just tossing out free copies of the game, Epic is paying them in order to be able to distribute it to their own players. It's like when a company lets Netflix stream their show for a fee. Epic then gives it out for free, in order to pull people in, and get them using their platform, which makes them more money in the long run.

**""This game has such a huge community though""**

And that's great. But man cannot live on Youtube clickbait alone. Look at TF2 for a good example. They've got an impressively community considering how long they've been around. However, that community generates very little revenue, so the game doesn't get tons of resources invested in it. I love this community, sithposts and all. But you have to admit, it's not exactly a cash cow.",,,1612979179
lgz3i1,EquivalentInflation,rant,"Star Wars fans gatekeeping headcanons is STUPIDI know the title sounds vague, so I'm gonna explain:

Star Wars is full of a lot of dumb stuff. So, if you start to watch a lot of the movies, or spend time on a sub like Prequel Memes, you start to pick up some theories or explanations for why certain illogical stuff works, even if it's not canon. Anakin's acting was bad on purpose, nobody realized Palpatine was Sidious because of force magic, etc. Sure, they can be kind of dumb, but they're fun, and make the Star Wars world feel connected. People also believe them without questioning. A post on the Star Wars sub explained how Obi Wan and Anakin doing elaborate lightsaber twirls was ""a circular parry"", and that Lucas had added it as a great detail. A literal google search shows you that no, making giant windmill lightsaber motions isn't how a circular parry works.

My issue is that if *anyone* tries to do that for the Sequels, they get shut down. Rey was good at lightsaber fighting because of her staff training? Nope, here's a three page essay on the differences between lightsabers and staffs. Finn was awkward with Rose because he had literally never had a romance before due to brainwashing? Nope, it has to just be a terrible plot.

I can get it if it's some giant, illogical theory. But the fact of the matter is, all Star Wars movies have canon breaking or illogical parts. It's OK to want to have fun ideas to plug those holes, or imagine things behind the scenes that explain stuff. Just don't stop other people from acting the same way.",,,1612979028
lgyo2g,EquivalentInflation,rant,"I'm done with Reddit defending Johnny DeppBefore I say anything else: Amber Heard is **awful.** She's a horrible, abusive person.

That doesn't excuse Johnny Depp for what he did. A [UK Court](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Depp_V_News_Group_Newspapers_Ltd_judgment.pdf) found that he met the civil standard for abuse on several instances. In numerous other legal cases, the civil standard has been upheld as legitimate proof for divorce, firing, etc. It wasn't a mistake, or a miscarriage of justice, it was the result of several months worth of evidence. 

It's also important to note that Depp wasn't suing Heard, he was suing the Sun Newspaper for libel in the UK. For context, the UK has really, really shitty libel laws... which *benefit* the prosecution (in this case, Depp). It is incredibly hard for the defense to win a libel trial, even if it's completely justified, since they work with a ""guilty until proven innocent"" method. The fact that the Sun *did* win is surprising, and very telling. [This](https://www.legalcheek.com/lc-journal-posts/a-critical-analysis-of-the-johnny-depp-libel-trial/) is a more in depth article that explains without taking a side.

Reddit seems to have a lot of misconceptions and misinformation on the case, so here we go:

* The Sun called Depp a ""wife-beater""
* Depp sued, claiming that was false
* The Sun had to provide evidence that he *did* beat his wife, involving Heard's testimony, as well as other witnesses, medical reports, etc.
* Depp attempted to bring evidence that he had been abused by Heard. The court denied it, *not* because they hate men or something (BTW, the judge was also a man). They did so because it was a libel trial, and therefore, irrelevant. Depp proving he had been hit by Heard did not alter whether or not he had beaten her.
* The judge found that in several cases, there was sufficient evidence to prove that Depp had beaten Heard
* The judge was *not* later proven to be bribed or disbarred, and an investigation by the UK showed no evidence of wrongdoing on his part.

Then, there's some people claiming that it was unfair, and that Hollywood was treating a female abuser better than a male one. For that, look at when Depp got fired by Warner. It *wasn't* in 2018 when allegations first came out, it was after his very high profile court case years later. WB didn't gain any new evidence, they fired him *because he was being public*. Hollywood doesn't care about men, or women, or black people, white people, gay, straight, whatever. They will eat the souls of children to get a 5% increase in ticket sales. Heard isn't protected because she's a woman, it's because she kept her head down and didn't start a court case that resulted in thousands of her private emails and texts discussing drugs being made public. 

Also, Heard's career is still in the toilet. People are focused on Aquaman. You know why? *Because that one minor side part is all she's gotten in two years*. The only other job she has is ""spokesperson"" for a few organizations, all of whom are smart enough to basically avoid her and not hire her for anything big. 

In short: Both are bad, neither are good, don't defend either one.",,,1612977925
lguzv7,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"WandaVision: SWORD was resurrecting Vision when Wanda stole himWe learn that Vision's will stated he wished to be left dead, and SWORD director Hayward accused Wanda of ignoring that. But take a look at the scene where Wanda gets Vision's body [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVBNAkrbAy0&amp;ab_channel=MarvelScenes). The body is surrounded by scientists. It's been partially disassembled, and it's clear they've been experimenting on it. By this point, it's been over five years since Vision died. Sure, they might need to figure out some kind of safe storage, or do basic checks, but that should *not* take five years. In addition, why would an organization Vision had never met be the ones to store him? The Avengers and Stark Industries would have a ton of places and methods of storage, as well as being his adopted family.

**SWORD wasn't trying to safely store Vision, they were experimenting on him, hoping to bring him back or duplicate him.**

That's part of why Wanda became so furious, and why she wouldn't trust SWORD at all. Look again at the break in scene; she walks into the building purposefully, and goes *directly* to where Vision was. She somehow found out what was going on, and decided to put an end to it. That's also why Hayward is so focused on painting Wanda as a villain, and mentally unstable. If it's revealed that he blatantly violated Vision's will, he'd have the mother of all lawsuits coming, as well as a number of *very* angry super powered individuals knocking on his door. It also seems fair to say that after the Ultron fiasco, someone experimenting with sentient AI in order to ""protect the world"" would be enough for him to lose his job. Just look at all of Hayward's actions: he sends a manned mission with no protection into the hex, interrupts a briefing from an expert to manipulate the facts (then essentially tells that expert to shut up when corrected), and orders a drone to open fire on her before she can reveal what he did. Even just looking at their meeting, it's obvious that they know each other, and that Wanda already hates him. He then tries to get in front of it by accusing *her* of violating Vision's will, to discredit any claims she might make.",,,1612968057

lffv0y,EquivalentInflation,cobrakai,"Why they couldn't just call the cops after the final fightI've seen a lot of people complaining about this as illogical, or a plot hole. I do agree that the cops definitely should have shown up at other times in the season, but in this case, it made sense. 

First, in the heat of the moment, there was no opportunity to call 911. The Cobra Kai kids weren't stupid, they didn't give Miyagi-Do or Eagle Fang a chance to think or react to their attack. The cops wouldn't be able to arrive until after all the Cobra Kai kids were gone.

Obviously, that still leaves the question of why they couldn't just call the cops afterwards. There was thousands of dollars in property damage, as well as numerous counts of assault, and one assault with a deadly weapon. The Cobra Kai kids were everywhere, and likely left DNA from their blood or scraped skin somwhere. Yes, Cobra Kai could try to claim that they were being framed by kids who they had a well known rivalry with, but even the most incompetent police department could manage to pin the crime on them. Kyler would definitely break down and snitch as well.

**The real reason they couldn't go to the cops was that Danny and Johnny attacked Kreese.**

They trespassed on private property, and attacked him. Sure, we know all the karate rivalry and blah blah blah, but let's look at it through the eyes of a court:

* Johnny has several counts of assault and battery, including against minors
* Johnny has a known alcohol problem
* Daniel trained a kid who then nearly murdered another boy
* Daniel's wife had a restraining order against Kreese
* Both of them have a very public grudge against Kreese, one they literally aired in public just a week or so previously, in front of city officials.

Now, imagine you're a juror, and you hear that those two attacked the polite, well spoken, elderly war veteran who spent his time helping disadvantaged youths learn valuable life lessons.

Obviously, we know all the backstory there, but for someone who doesn't? They look guilty as hell, especially if Kreese decides to play the old man card. For him, taking that kind of beating is no problem, but a regular 75 year old? That could kill them.

There'd be no possible way to trace the Cobra Kai kid's actions back to Kreese-- he's too smart for that. None of them would dare rat him out, and he had a witness stating he was at his dojo during the attack. Kreese can't be held liable for the actions of his ""rogue"" kids. Even if Hawk turns, it's the word of a war hero against a teenage criminal who'd have to admit to several crimes.

**If they call the cops on the Cobra Kai kids, Kreese calls the cops on Johnny and Daniel.**

Mutually assured destruction (something Kreese, as a military man, would understand well). If Tory &amp; co. go down, Johnny and Daniel go down with them. And then what does Kreese do? Recruit a brand new batch of kids (it took him what, a week to find five or six perfect recruits?). Within a month or two, Kreese is back exactly where he was, this time with an even better situation (if Sam or Robby accuse him of anything, he just claims they want revenge for their father-figures). It then leaves the Miyagi Do and Eagle Fang kids with no senseis, and no training, against an even bolder Kreese.",,,1612802738
lff4ke,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"James Bond: Bond isn't meant to succeed, he's meant to be a distraction007's methods are... unique, to say the very least. He seems to have no patience for spycraft of any kind, and instead, seems to prefer going directly up to a villain while drunk and telling them his real name. He's absolutely a deadly force of nature, and can survive almost any encounter. However, you'd expect the world's greatest spy to be a little less well known. You also have to wonder what the hell MI6 is doing. Why would a *secret* organization hire a guy who constantly uses his real name in public? Also, I don't know the exact finances of international spies, but it seems like they could hire a dozen highly trained spies and assassins for the price of Bond's alcohol and sports cars *alone*. 

**Bond fills the role of ""doomed spy"" for MI6, allowing them to sneak other spies into the enemy organization.**

For those who don't know, the doomed spy was tactic where a person would be recruited as a spy, given false information, and used as a sacrifice to the enemy, sometimes with another spy turning them in. That way, the enemy would get false information, and would be lulled into a false sense of security. It would also give credibility to the real spy. 

Every time Bond crashes one of SPECTRE's casinos drunk and tries to seduce the villain's assistant, there's a dozen MI6 agents using the opportunity to slip in unnoticed. Nobody's going to question Jimmy in accounting because he spent a little too much time going over SPECTRE expenses while there's a drunken brit with submachinegun car running wild. It's also far, far simpler to get moles into SPECTRE and other organizations. Consider: every time Bond blows up an enemy base, there's likely at least some survivors. However, all of the records from that base are destroyed, and the heads of their security, science division, etc. are likely dead. That means that instead of having an agent join up and gain credibility over the course of years, MI6 can get an agent directly into SPECTRE with little suspicion. 

That's also how Bond constantly manages to survive, even against crazy odds. Yes, he's still insanely skilled as a killer, but he also has MI6 agents backing him up from the shadows. For every goon we see Bond take down, there's another who got garotted in a dark corridor, or who was ordered to go on a wild goose chase far from the base. 

However, there's the obvious hole in this-- Bond doesn't die, and MI6 often rescues him. 

**MI6 decided to change the doomed spy role, in order to keep Bond alive as a constant threat.** 

Bond even says himself, he's the world's most famous spy. You would think that that would be a negative, but MI6 turns it into a positive. Look at almost every famous spy in history. None are anyone who you'd find immediately dangerous or threatening, many just infiltrated a place and took pictures. The few that would present a legitimate threat would kill you before you ever knew they were there. None of them dressed up in a suit worth thousands of dollars and drove up to the enemy's front gate in a sports car. Bond constantly gets captured because people recognize him, even if he does make an attempt to be somewhat subtle. He almost never tries to disguise his extremely famous face that SPECTRE is well aware of. That functions as a distraction, as stated above, but also as a scare tactic. Think about it: James Bond has a similar effect to John Wick, he's essentially ""the bogeyman"" for international criminals. Every time he shows up at a place, nearly everyone there dies (with MI6 help, but of course, nobody knows that). For your average goon, that's going to terrify you, and fill you with doubt. When Bond actually does come at them, they're often too panicked to be able to do much damage. It also seems fair to say that the second Bond arrives, there's a few dozen goons, henchmen, and flunkies who decide to get the hell out of dodge. 

MI6 uses that scare tactic the same way a stage magician uses smoke or loud noises. ""Look over hear, at that plume of blue smoke, ignore what's happening behind that curtain"". Everyone is so busy looking for the attractive man in a suit, none of them look twice at the mousy IT lady, or the fact that they've never seen that plumber before. It also means that once Bond shows up, they stop expecting enemy spies at all. Everyone knows Bond works alone, maybe with one or two sidekicks, so they don't anticipate more MI6 agents infiltrating them. 

**TL;DR: James Bond's job isn't to succeed on his own, it's to provide a distraction, allowing other MI6 agents to secretly infiltrate the enemy. Those agents then help strengthen Bond's reputation as an unstoppable killer, which serves as psychological warfare against their enemies.**",,,1612800750

lcp9zm,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"MCU: During WWII, the US made a deal with Hydra in secret**I know, I know, they let Zola and others join SHIELD. I'm not making a theory about a literal plot point of the movie. Bear with me here. There was more to the deal than just ayslum...**

WWII in the Marvel Cinematic Universe went far differently than how it went for us. Hydra betrayed the Nazis, seizing territory and resources from them. They captured Bucky Barnes's regiment after wiping out a division of Nazi soldiers that had engaged them. We don't know many exact details about exactly where they held territory, but from the map, [\[0:37\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1HrdInI_lw&amp;ab_channel=TheosSuperheroes), we can tell that they have a decent amount of land. Later, we see that some new markers have been added to the map, representing newly discovered Hydra bases, or their troop movements [\[0:28\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTi-TW65vWY&amp;ab_channel=FilmStudiesFundamentals). During the [Howling Commandos montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTi-TW65vWY&amp;ab_channel=FilmStudiesFundamentals), we see that they're attacking a number of locations, including high tech labs like the main bases they're after, but also simple warehouses, occupied towns, forests, etc. They also are shown fighting alongside a number of regular soldiers. From that, we can gather that it wasn't just a matter of having their strike team hit a few bases, they were cutting supply lines, taking strategic positions, and pushing back significant enemy forces. From all of that, we can gather that Hydra wasn't just a mild irritance, or a small group of scientists, they had a military roughly on par with that of a sovereign nation. Definitely not on par with the Allied forces in numbers, but their advanced technology gave them an edge. 

Obviously, all of that would be a major blow to Germany. Hydra took with it a number of its best scientific minds, as well as a large amount of territory and resources. Those super-science factories weren't running off of nothing, they'd consume a massive amount of raw materials. Then, there's the military threat of fighting yet another enemy. They were facing the Americans and British to the West (and later, from underneath after the invasion of Italy), the Soviets to the East, a large number of resistance forces in their captured nations, and now, a highly advanced, well armed splinter group encroaching on it's territory and seizing vital factories and resources.

It's no secret that the US made some deals with the devil in WWII. We were willing to ally ourselves with the USSR, a brutal and totalitarian regime, as well as letting them seize a massive amount of land.  After the war, through Operation Paperclip, we let a number of Nazi War criminals off easy so that we could recruit them for science programs. It seems fair to say that an alliance with Hydra wouldn't be out of the question, after the Red Skull had been eliminated. Schmitd was a fanatic, but Zola was far more pragmatic. He would absolutely be willing to ally with the US, seeing it as an opportunity to survive and thrive. Obviously, a deal like that would never be able to be revealed to the public, and would have to be kept under wraps. But, if all of Hydra's remaining forces turned on the Germans, and just so happened to ignore the Allies? We know from Agent Carter that, while badly injured by Cap's campaign, Hydra still had bases and soldiers left, enough to swing the tide of the war. Things like the Battle of the Bulge wouldn't have been able to happen if there had been another army approaching from Hydra's positions in the Baltics. However, in public, the US would still have to pretend to be opposed to Hydra, thus, Agent Carter taking down Reinhardt. 

Obviously, that deal seems a bit lacking for Hydra. Their soldiers die fighting for the Allies, then the Allies kill or capture most of their soldiers and some commanders. But, consider exactly *who* we see getting captured: Reinhardt and his men, a group whose scientific plans were based on the ""master race"". Zola was a scientist, and throughout the movie, showed little actual belief or interest in the ideas of the Nazis. He and Schmidt both pretty clearly view such things as distractions, which makes sense: if you want to control the world like slaves, you don't really need to think any of those slaves are better than the others. So, Zola agreed to some parts of Hydra being sacrificed, while his core group of scientists and leaders got off scot free, along with much of their research.

**So far, all of this has been pretty basic; either things from the movies, or just making pretty simple connections. Here's where it get's interesting:**

**The US** ***purposefully*** **let Hydra re-form**

Think about it: How *dumb* would the US have to be to let that happen? They just brought over a bunch of Hydra scientists, the same people who'd been trying to super-nuke them less than a year previously, and then gave them control of SHIELD? Yes, Zola and Hydra can be devious, but if they were coming over as prisoners or asylum seekers, they'd be constantly monitored by their superiors, just like actual Nazis from Operation Paperclip were. However, the deal Zola had made changed that. They weren't coming as tools or resources, they were coming as leaders, to shape the future of SHIELD. Why would they do that? Simple: the Cold War. The US was shaping up to fight the USSR, and it was around that time that the USSR developed their own nuclear weapons. We can only imagine what kind of crazy arms race there would be in a world with super science, and gaining Hydra gave the US a major edge.

Look at some of the real world things that the CIA did during the Cold War: MK Ultra, Operation Northwoods, a bajillion different coups and assassinations. The US was fighting to win, and didn't care what morals got in the way. So Hydra, an organization experienced in manipulation and control would be the perfect fit for them. They didn't try to stop Hydra, or limit it, they helped them expand and rebuild themselves into SHIELD. 

That's how they managed to get so many people into high ranking political positions. Think about it: Most top military and espionage officials only get their posts after \~30 years of service, at minimum. Being in an agency like SHIELD, or something as big as the World Security council would likely take even longer. Alexander Pierce for example had decades of experience in the state department, as well as lower positions on the World Security council, and even was nominated for a Nobel prize. That kind of stuff doesn't happen fast, and they'd need dozens, if not hundreds of Hydra agents working at the highest levels of the military, as well as the DC police, likely some senators and representatives to make sure they kept their funding... Many of those people wouldn't need to be career Hydra, they could just be bribed or blackmailed, but it would still be an *immense* undertaking. Just consider how fast they manage to take over SHIELD: Fury is incapacitated, Cap and Nat are on the run, and the entire Insight project is completely under their control, with no one the wiser. They weren't fighting a battle, they were squashing a bug. The only part of it that failed was their muscle; the higher ups had it planned perfectly. 

They were able to achieve that level of control by starting their rebuilding almost immediately in the late 40's. They weren't infiltrating SHIELD, they were helping build it from the ground up, making sure *their* people were all in important positions. Peggy Carter did her best, but she was with the SOE for several years, only joining SHIELD far later, when the damage had been done. 

**TL;DR: Hydra made a deal with the US government, being explicitly allowed to reform as SHIELD in exchange for military aid, and help during the Cold War.**",,,1612470646

lchrxm,EquivalentInflation,rant,"Stop acting like ""innocent until proven guilty"" means something it doesn't.Every single goddamn person who says this, in real life, or on the Internet leaves off a crucial part: Innocent until proven guilty *in the eyes of the law*. Let's say someone commits a murder, but does a good enough job covering it up that the police can't convict them easily. That person is *guilty*. However, that person is *innocent* in the eyes of the law, until they can be proven guilty in a court of law.

What people seem to miss, or purposefully ignore, is that those people *always* were either innocent or guilty. The assumption on the part of the court isn't an actual evidence based statement, it's meant to make sure that a defendant is treated fairly, and give them the benefit of the doubt.

People also seem to not understand that innocent until proven guilty *does not affect* how people view or talk about a person. Al Capone was never found guilty of murder (they could only get him on tax evasion and contempt of court), and in the eyes of the law, is still innocent of murder. That doesn't change the fact that he's a murderer, and I'm gonna damn well call him that.

There's obviously an important discussion to be had, and I'm not trying to make a statement on how we should treat people accused of things, because that's a *very* complicated and nuanced argument with no simple answer. My only point is that people misunderstand what ""innocent until proven guilty"" means, and that in order for any real conversation to happen, people have to be aware of how it works. It does *not* mean that a person accused of or on trial for a crime has to be viewed as innocent by civilians, only by the court and legal system.",,,1612451706
lchkoi,EquivalentInflation,teenagers,"No Karen, I'm not ""lucky"" because I'm losing a ton of weight.(Kinda just need to rant at a person we'll just call Karen, and can't do it in person)

I got diagnosed with ADD about two years ago, and had to start taking Vyvanse. It's honestly great, and I can actually talk normally to people now, pay attention in my classes, and do everyday stuff like driving without having to worry. 

However, one of the side effects is that it kills my appetite. I can eat a bagel in the morning, and not feel any hunger until around three in the afternoon. Apparently to some pieces of shit I talk to ""That's so great, because you don't have to worry about dieting! You can always be in shape! You don't need to worry about eating junk food!""

In the first six weeks, I lost thirty pounds. I'd been roughly average weight for my height, and all of a sudden, my weight started to drop a *lot*. I was essentially told that if I kept going like that, I wouldn't be able to keep using the medication. My grades were going up in school, I was getting along better with people, so I was willing to do *anything* to make sure I got to keep that.

Have you ever eaten a massive thanksgiving dinner, where you felt so full that eating even a little more food makes you feel sick? That's how I feel after eating a *fucking sandwich* Karen. I literally had to force food down my throat at lunch to make sure that I was getting just a regular meal in. Over time, I got used to it, and started to figure out how to spread a meal out into a bunch of smaller snacks so it felt slightly better. Then, Covid came along, and I started spending my entire day at home. I'd eat something small in the morning, then I'd completely forget to eat again until noon, causing me to drop a ton of weight again. Without the kind of schedule I'd had, I had a horrible time trying to make sure I ate enough, and I still haven't fully gotten it worked out.

So yeah Karen, if you start talking about how ""lucky"" I am for constantly making myself feel like I'm going to vomit just by eating the bare minimum food I need, *I'm gonna get pissed at you*.",,,1612451159

lcgymr,EquivalentInflation,teenagers,"Netflix does a good job with gay characters, and I'm sick of the memes and criticismThe first and most obvious point: Yeah, they're pretty one dimensional. *So are most of the other characters on Netflix*. Their entire business model is cranking out as many shows as possible, most of which have very low quality. It's completely hypocritical to go after them only when a poorly written character or romance is gay, but not when they're straight. For example, Cobra Kai. Moon is shown to be dating a girl briefly in season 2 (side note: funniest coming out scene e*ver*) , then both she and her girlfriend are barely in season 3. However, the show also features Moon's friend Jasmin, whose entire personality is basically just roleplaying Mean Girls, and who randomly decides to date a guy in season 3 after talking to him twice (both of which involved her mocking him). Both romances have very little screen time or development, but only one gets criticized.

True equality means that LGBTQ characters get to be every bit as shitty and poorly written as straight characters, and I'm here for it. Every movie isn't going to be a work of art, and trying to make them that way just decreases the opportunity for us to get quality LGBTQ characters. Diehard is my absolute favorite action movie of all time. However, for every Diehard, there's a hundred shitty, poorly written and acted action movies. If you want one, you've got to have the other.

Then there's the claim that ""every character is gay"". GLAAD did a report on Netlfix in 2019, and found that, out of all their original major characters (so excluding any shows that they just bought the rights to, and background characters), just under 10% were LGBTQ. That's roughly in line with population estimates, especially considering many of the characters are teens, who have a far easier time coming out, and thus have higher rates of being LGTBQ. Yeah, they have way higher rates than almost any other streaming service. *That's a good thing*. They're legitimately working to provide better representation.

Then of course, there's the people who love to argue that representation doesn't matter at all, or that they don't care what sexuality a character is. In general, those people haven't had to look far for their own representation, they've had plenty. When I was a kid, I grew up in an area where talking about *anything* LGBTQ was taboo. I wasn't taught to hate, I just wasn't taught at all. Watching Brooklyn 99, Rosa Diaz came out as bisexual, and explained what it meant to her. It was the first time I'd ever seen an openly Bi character, and the first time I learned *that was actually a thing*. I'd legitimately never been exposed to something like that, and everything she was saying, I agreed with (Zack Morris and Lisa Turtle *were* both hot). It made me look into it more, and helped me realize that maybe the reason I constantly kept acting super awkward around the cute guy at school wasn't platonic friendship. Seeing someone likes you on TV or in a movie is always great. Yes, I can love other characters that I'm not similar to at all, like Princess Leia, or Hermione, but at the end of the day, having a character show you that a major part of yourself is natural and good will always have meaning to people.

None of this means Netflix is without it's flaws-- I have some *serious* issues with the queerbaiting in Lucifer.

lc8xa5,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"MCU: Mutants already existOne of the big questions about phase four of the MCU is how they'll introduce mutants, the most common theory being that Wanda will somehow create them, reversing what she did in the comics.

But what if mutants don't need to be created *because they're already around*?

Consider Tom Holland's Spider-Man. When Tony comes to recruit Spiderman, *he doesn't ask how he got his powers*. That seems more than a little bit odd. After all, Tony only hypothetically knows of five or six people with legitimate super powers, all of whose origins involved some crazy situation that would be insanely rare. Another super hero should at least be somewhat surprising to him. It should also be way more surprising for the world as a whole. He literally got caught on video leg pressing a bus, and somehow it's not major news that the entire world is talking about. Consider that a few blurry pictures from 1934 *still* make people believe in the Loch Ness monster. Now imagine the effect of a full color HD video of someone with super powers, with dozens of witnesses to corroborate. From that, we can guess that people with super powers has become far, far more common. Definitely not everyday, but certainly nothing groundbreaking. Even if you don't believe that, then it means there's a precedent for superpowers being major news that happens off screen.

In addition, there's Nick Fury recruiting Iron Man for the Avengers. Chronologically, that happens *before* the Thor movie, Hulk movie, or Captain America being thawed out. Fury had a guy in a metal suit, a guy with a bow and arrow, a scissor kicking woman with guns, and a hail-mary that he could call in Captain Marvel. Not to mention, he had no idea of what kind of threats the Avengers might face. At that point, he only knew about the Kree and Skrull, whom Captain Marvel was defending Earth from. The only reason Fury would make a team then was because he knew he could find super powered people, and that he knew there would be super powered threats for them to fight.

It seems fair to say that citizens in the MCU have grown accustomed to seeing people with powers, to the point where questioning how those powers came about basically doesn't happen. That means it would be easy for mutants to fly under the radar. Most could hide their powers (feared and hated, blah blah blah), and the few who got caught on video, or turned hero wouldn't be seen as anything too special.",,,1612417864
lc7k93,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"The Lion King: Scar was the hero, Mufasa was the villain.Yes, I know, Scar murdered all our childhoods by killing Mufasa. But let's look at what the two *actually* did.

Mufasa ran the Pride lands, which *seemed* like a paradise. He gave a big speech about the circle of life, a system where the lions get the absolute best position. ""Sure, we kill the antelope, but then our bodies turn to grass, and they eat that, so it's OK"". Just consider how many antelope a full grow lion eats over the course of his life, only to produce enough grass to feed one, *maybe* two antelope for a day. It's basically just biological trickle down economics. But, as we know, predators play an important role in a biological ecosystem, right? As unfair as it is, Mufasa needs to keep that balance. But then *why* does he banish the hyenas? They play a vital role in the ecosystem. Contrary to popular belief, they're more than just scavengers, they're also formidable predators, getting about 80-90% of their food from hunting. Even when scavenging, they make sure food isn't wasted, and pick off older and weaker animals, thus stopping overpopulation. They're also extremely intelligent social animals, who will raise the cubs of dead hyenas, unlike *lions*. However, Mufasa chose to banish them to a place with no food or clean water to slowly die. ""We're all part of the circle of life son-- except those guys, fuck those guys, let 'em die"".

Compare that to Scar. Yes, he killed Mufasa and tried to kill Simba. *That's natural for a pride of lions.* Mufasa doesn't get to talk about how it's the ""natural order of things"" for him to kill others, yet be surprised when it happens to him. Real life lions *will* kill the cubs of the past pride leader, in order to cement their dominance, and since they're unable to make cubs of their own otherwise. Then, consider how he treats the hyenas. What's his one promise to them? Food. Not power, revenge, anything else, just the ability to not watch their children starve to death. Even when they take power, they don't attempt revenge on the lions. Yeah, there's obviously resentment, but they don't try to banish the lions like they'd been banished, or wipe them out entirely. In fact, they just want to live there *with* the lions, an impressive show of unity. Scar does treat them somewhat badly, insulting their intelligence and batting them around occasionally. Again, shows of strength are normal for lions, and while he may be condescending towards them, he kept his word to them. With the pride at his back, he easily could have wiped them out, but instead, chose to honor his promise. Even when there's a lack of food, Scar won't just let the hyenas die, he chooses to keep helping them. The movie then chooses to portray Scar as the villain, for causing the drought. Bull. Shit. The leaves and plants are shown to be dying and brown. That's not an issue that comes from overpopulation, that's an issue that comes from *drought*. Scar got blamed for a natural occurrence he had no control over. Then, Simba comes in, and it immediately rains, solving the issue. Maybe Rafiki did some magic to stop the rain, maybe Mufasa was being an Astral Asshole by keeping the rain away, or maybe it was just pure chance. Whatever the reason, Scar was the fall guy (pun intended), and Simba took the credit for something he had nothing to do with.

**TL;DR: Mufasa was a power hungry despot, as well as a speciesist (?) against the hyenas, violating his own supposed beliefs, while Scar strived for equality, and treated the hyenas well.**",,,1612413170
lc6wk9,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Assassins Creed: The Assassins are the ones making the games, not Templars.Part of the meta story for the AC Franchise covers the idea that Abstergo is using the Animus to record Assassin memories and turn them into video games, the same games that *you* are playing (insert shocked gasps here). They even made a tongue-in-cheek reference to them being business partners with Ubisoft. The idea is that they can spread Templar propaganda that way.

However, that seems very, very weird.

They briefly mention that there's a group of hackers that expose the Templar's secrets, but that still makes no sense. Why would the game follow the Assassins that closely if they were meant to be the villains? And how would they be unable to stop those hackers from completely altering the games?

**The Assassin's Brotherhood are the ones actually making the games.**

The games are all about how badass the Assassins are, how they fight for freedom, how they look out for the little guy. Occasionally, they'll show the Assassins making mistakes, like Al Mualim, but the problem is always solved *by an Assassin*.

lbihhw,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Men in Black: The MIB are actually the villainsAt first look in the movie, the MIB seem to be heroes: Badasses in cool outfits with shades and laser guns, who get to fight aliens and use crazy technology.

But let's take a step back and look at how horrifying they actually are. They're operating outside the law, with no oversight or consent by any world government. If they did have any international agreements, it was likely done via neuralyzer. They show that they can edit the civilian computer history of their agents to erase them, meaning they have complete control of basically any computer on Earth.

In addition, consider how horrible the neuralyzer is: they can wipe out someone's memory of a loved one, or plant a thought in their head that isn't their own. The farm wife they neuralyze in MIB 1 now thinks her husband ran out on her... and has no memory of the article she wrote about him being an alien, which her friends or family will likely bring up. That can only lead to a really, really bad mental breakdown.

They're also imprisoning aliens, and setting laws in place with zero legal authority or code. Agent K literally assaults Frank to try and get information, and threatens to have him sent to the pound (likely to be euthanized). It gets played for laughs since he looks like a pug, but just thinking about it makes it way darker. That's a sentient, intelligent being he's harming and threatening to kill, and it's treated as routine. Aliens aren't being treated fairly, or with any rights, they're just dealt with case-by-case, depending on what the MIB want.

Finally, they're denying humanity a chance to deal with aliens. Their entire job is to make sure that the ordinary peons of the world never find out about alien life. That of course doesn't stop them from ripping off alien technology and selling it to people. Velcro, microwaves and others were shown to be confiscated alien tech. If stuff like that is avaliable, what are they hiding? Humanity could get clean energy, medicine, all kinds of advancements, but no. The MIB may even choose to hide aliens so they can keep profiting off of them.

Before the MIB movies came out, ""men in black suits"" were considered villains in basically every movie, members of some shadowy government organization with too much power. In the MIB movies, they're basically the same, but now they have cool music, gadgets, and look like badasses.

We're always shown the times MIB are in the right, when they're justified. How many other times did an agent use a neuralyzer to get some cash? Or leave people with no memory of their loved ones? Or lock up an alien with no trial, just because they felt like it?",,,1612338053

lawsmq,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Greek Mythology: Aphrodite is the one making Zeus cheat on Hera, as revengeIt's the biggest running joke in Greek Mythology: Zeus has hundreds, even thousands of affairs (many of which were basically just rape). That's a massive embarassment to Hera. The goddess of happy marriage and faithfulness has a horrible marriage with a husband who cheats on her. She's the laughingstock of Olympus, and becomes horribly bitter and jealous. Early in her life, she's portrayed as more kind, and loving, before going full on baby murder later on.

But, guess who on Olympus **literally controls love and desire?** That's right, Aphrodite. Notably, before Aphrodite became an Olympian, there aren't really any instances of Zeus being unfaithful to his first wife, Mentes, or during the start of his marriage to Hera. Then, along comes Aphrodite, who had the ability to control love, as well as her son Eros (aka Cupid), capable of making anyone fall in love, even gods. There are a few myths about what happened when she arrived, but they all boil down to one thing: Aphrodite was forced to marry the ugly Hephaestus by Hera and Zeus. Obviously, for the goddess of love and beauty, being trapped in a marriage with someone like Hephaestus was a massive insult, and she was known for holding grudges.

**Aphrodite used her powers of love to make Zeus constantly cheat on Hera, humiliating her just like Hera had once humiliated Aphrodite.**",,,1612276401
lawseq,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Harry Potter: The dementor that kissed Crouch Jr. did so under Voldemort's ordersHow convenient is it that the very instant Voldemort's return is about to be revealed to the Minister of Magic, the only man who can corroborate Harry's story gets his soul sucked out *by one of Voldemort's soon to be allies?*

Remember, not even a year later, the Dementors allowed some of Voldemort's top supporters to break out of Azkaban. It's currently unknown exactly how they acted in the First Wizarding War (all we know is that they didn't join Voldemort en masse, but possibly in small numbers). They also were strongly in favor of Voldemort's ideas; they supported whatever allowed them to have the most victims, and Voldemort's plan meant giving hundreds of muggleborns to them, as well as letting them run free among muggles. Dumbledore even tells Fudge that the Dementors are already on Voldemort's side, and while he can be a lying bastard, if Dumbledore is talking strategy, he's pretty reliable.

The dementors likely weren't yet willing to commit fully to Voldemort, especially when the situation was so uncertain. However, they'd likely be willing to do a small favor, one that might help Voldemort, especially if they faced little threat of exposure. Fudge brought the dementor in roughly 8 hours after Voldemort's return. That's plenty of time for a message to be sent, one that could make the situation clear, and offer a deal. From the Dementor's point of view, they got a free soul-sucking, and had the opportunity to make a big decision between the Ministry and Voldemort. Even if they stayed loyal, they could likely pressure the Ministry to offer them better terms, playing both sides off of each other. They knew Fudge was a coward, and that he'd never dare punish them. Fudge flat out says he could never remove them from Azkaban without being impeached. It was all gain, no risk.",,,1612276387
labhe5,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"The Mandalorian: Thrawn survived Ezra's trap because he's a force sensitiveOne of the biggest teases from the new Mandalorian season was Ahsoka searching for Thrawn, and hunting his allies, suggesting that he's still alive and scheming.

Last we saw him though, he was being jumped off into hyperspace by Purrgils. Star Wars Squadrons mentions that his fate was unknown to the Empire, so it seems unlikely that they rescued him. So how did he manage to escape?

We learn from Thrawn that the Chiss have force sensitives, but a very different view of the force. They call it ""The Light"". While generally female, there are a small number of Chiss males who can use it. Third sight is an ability some have that lets them predict future events. They use this for their ""Sky-walkers"" (yes, that's the actual name), so that they can act as natural hyperdrive computers, predicting the best possible route. That ability fades with age, but never truly goes away. Thrawn never says it outright, but it's heavily hinted at that he combines his limited third sight with his logical mind to continue using it past the usual age of 20, giving him his trademark ability to plan. His sister was a force sensitive, so it seems fair to assume it can run in the family, just like Luke and Leia. He also shows a large amount of knowledge on the Light, despite mentioning that it's kept secret from most Chiss who don't get training.

Thrawn then escaped using the Second Sight ability. This ability was far more mysterious, but was linked to telepathy, just like the mind control Ezra used on the Purrgils. It also had no age limit, and could be used by any Chiss with the Third Sight, but was incredibly rare. Notably, male chiss with the ability were so uncommon *that they never bothered to test them*. Thrawn explains that the ability took a long time to manifest, and often wasn't immediately obvious. It could only be discovered through very vigorous tests, or through some intense event that triggered it as a fight-or-flight mechanism. I'd say getting yeeted into space by a kid with some magic space whales would count as traumatic.

**So in summary: Thrawn was force sensitive, but was never fully developed by the Chiss Ascendancy. He used his limited abilities to be a master tactician and planner. That ability was nowhere near enough to pull off his tactics though, requiring him to be incredibly intelligent. Then, when sent into hyperspace by Ezra, he managed to overpower him (he has experience fighting much stronger enemies, and trained for force sensitives). Thrawn then had his second sight ability kick in, allowing him to control the purrgils, and ride to safety**",,,1612207136

In addition, we see in that movie that they had a list of potential threats, including the Avengers, who they planned to sky-snipe the second their helicarriers lifted off.

But what if that wasn't their first attempt at killing the Avengers? After all, why wait until your enemy has joined together, trained, and become experienced cooperating? In the Avengers movie, SHIELD has kept tabs on all the Avengers, and brings them together.

Nuking the city can easily be blamed on the aliens, and no one would ever know. They already had plans in place to take out Fury, Hill, and other SHIELD loyalists, which they were probably about to activate when Iron Man caught the nuke.

laarf9,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Homecoming: Peter Parker's school is a magnet school for SHIELD**TL;DR: SHIELD funds a free school for various kid geniuses and prodigies, which lets them create their own future agents, spies, scientists, etc.**

Peter goes to Midtown school of Science and Technology. Right off the bat, that's a bit weird. It's shown to be a school exactly suited for his particular skills and interests, with access to a ton of great stuff. He creates military grade spiderwebs in their chem lab for crying out loud. That's not the kind of school that's cheap, and we know Peter and Aunt May don't have much money. Yet somehow, he can go there, even before he meets Tony (who could have paid for it).

Let's look more at the school. We know they have an Academic Decathlon team capable of winning the entire national competition, a robotics team good enough to interest a genius like Peter and a student news division with near professional level gear. In addition, their classes seem to focus on some pretty advanced stuff, as well as in depth looks at important current events, like the Sokovia accords. All of that, for a school that's apparently free, or at least very cheap.

Now, let's look at their students. You have Peter, who was already a near genius before he got his powers, Betty Brant, who is already close to her goal of being a professional newscaster, Liz Toomes, who is the head of the National Champion Academic Decathalon team (and likely inherited some tech skills from her dad), MJ, who is shown to be intelligent, resourceful, and deeply involved in politics, Ned Lee, who showed a large amount of skill with computers and hacking. It seems fair to say that the students at the school seem to be cherry picked for being exceptionally intelligent, with interests in various vital careers. Hell, Peter gets an internship with Stark Industries as a Sophomore in High School, and it's seen as a minor thing. They're shaping the minds of the next generation, which is the goal of every school (hypothetically). But look at what they're emphasizing: Cutting edge science, super powered individuals, media control, and politics. Those are the fields you'd need for control, the same fields SHIELD specializes in. Not to mention that a lot of the kids have links. Flash's family is clearly wealthy, and Liz's father has connections to the crime world as well as his tech genius the Tinkerer, who SHIELD would likely want to ally with.

We only see Peter's principal for a few brief scenes, but in one of those, we see his office, where there's a picture of Captain America and the Howling Commandos, along with his nameplate: Morita. AKA, his grandfather, Jim Morita, Howling Commando, and one of the founders of SHIELD. That's likely also the reason he keeps Captain America's PSAs running against orders: He still respects him, due to his grandfather's stories. The school also features a mural, which shows Howard Stark and Abraham Erskine. One of the men who founded SHIELD, along with one who greatly influenced it. Finally, Talos the skrull is shown having infiltrated the school as a teacher in Endgame. It seems like more than a coincidence that so many important people with ties to SHIELD are hanging around this school.

SHIELD employs a vast array of politicians, scientists, media contacts, spies, hackers, and agents. Those people don't just pop up out of nowhere, they need education and training. But, for the top secret kind of work SHIELD does, they need to ensure loyalty, and have a good idea of who people really are. How better to do that than collect those people yourself, and train them while monitoring them? Even when Peter gets in trouble, Morita lets him off easily because he ""sees great potential"". When they really do make mistakes, they get advice from Cap, SHIELD's ideal agent. Something most real life intelligence agencies learn is to use the mundane as a disguise, which SHIELD learned well. Their HQ isn't some volcano lair, it's a bureaucratic skyscraper complex in DC in plain view. In the same way, rather than breaking into people's homes and sitting in the dark until they arrive to give a dramatic speech, SHIELD realized they could just offer kids a great education for free, and prep them for SHIELD in an open, visible school.

When SHIELD went all ""Hail Hydra"", that plan went out the window, at least hypothetically. In reality, we've seen that Fury kept SHIELD alive, just in the shadows. That would make getting new agents he could be *certain* weren't HYDRA even more of a priority, especially ones who'd lived through both the Chitauri attack and later, the Snap (I refuse to call it the blip). They knew what kind of threats the world faces, and would be even more dedicated to protecting it.

Edit: In addition to that, SHIELD and Fury show that they can easily reroute Peter's entire class trip in Far From Home, despite it being planned months in advance, suggesting they have a large degree of control over the school. Thanks to u/sygryda for pointing that out.",,,1612205429

In the third episode of ATLA, Aang returns to his home at the Southern Air temple, where he finds that the Fire Nation wiped out his people. Most specifically (and heart breakingly) he finds the dead body of Monk Gyatso, his adoptive father, surrounded by dead fire nation soldiers ([Fig 1](https://imgur.com/a/K7ru8Mq)). You would assume that the fire nation soldiers killed him.

However, on second glance, this scene seems a bit... odd. Gyatso's bones and clothes don't seem to have any burn marks on them, like you'd expect from someone *murdered by firebenders*. In addition, there's at least ten or fifteen fire nation soldiers there. Remember, this attack happened during Sozin's comet, a time when even regular firebenders got supercharged. It'd be the equivalent of every Army grunt suddenly becoming a Navy Seal. For a monk who can only act in self defense, that's pretty impressive to take them all down alone. It's even more so when you remember airbenders thrived fighting in open spaces, when they could use their superior agility and speed to move around and avoid attacks. In this case, Gyatso was trapped in a small space.

**Gyatso lured Fire Nation soldiers into a small area, then sucked the air out of it, killing both them and himself.**

It's been established that airbenders can kill people by sucking out air ([Fig 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=nb2DbTAUkCA&amp;ab_channel=JordiMulder)). Gyatso was an airbending *master*, with decades of experience and training. If Zaheer could pull off that move after a week, Gyatso could easily do it in a small enclosed space.

Fire needs oxygen to burn, meaning that, by sucking out the air, Gyatso deprived the firebenders of their only weapon. They were effectively powerless. In addition, what Airbenders could do was far more than just making people hold their breath, it was physically sucking all of the air out of their lungs. Most people can hold their breath for \~90 seconds before it starts to get bad, and even then, they have about another minute before death. In this case, they'd have maybe thirty seconds, and wouldn't have enough blood in circulation to move.

In his death, Gyatso stuck to the principles he'd lived his life by. He attacked only in self defense, and took life with as little suffering as possible. In doing so, he likely provided an opportunity for other Air Nomads to escape (we know that some made it out before being hunted down), and sacrificed his life for that of others",,,1612104891

l8usmb,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Jurassic Park: The rival company BioSyn were the ones to kill the crew on the T-Rex's shipThe T-Rex ship scene has always been one of the weirdest plot holes in Jurassic Park: The ship carrying a T-Rex crashes into the dock, and, upon boarding, it's revealed that the entire crew has been brutally and bloodily slaughtered. The captain's severed hand is still on the steering wheel, and the giant cargo hold in the center is closed, with the severed arm of a dead crewmate still holding down the ""close"" button. When the cargo hold is opened, the T-Rex pops out, and wreaks havoc.

The question is, *how the hell did that happen*? The control room where the captain was was far too small for the T-Rex to fit it's head into. In addition, there's a large number of severed hands, arms, legs, etc. lying around. How did the giant teeth of the T-Rex bite with *that* much precision? Finally, how did it end up in the cargo hold? Did it bite off a man's arm just as he pressed the ""close"" button, sprint over, do a flip, and land inside just before the doors slammed shut? There's been rumors of deleted scenes involving raptors (which then begs the question of where the raptors went), or that it was originally in a cage on the deck (which still doesn't explain the captain's hands, or how it ended up in the hold). Not to mention, how did a giant freighter stay exactly on course through rough waters with no one steering?

In the original Jurassic Park movie, Nedry is shown to be working for a shadow company bent on stealing dinosaur embryos. In the book, they received more development. Their name was BioSyn and it was explained their company functioned by committing corporate espionage, and that they were the only company to hire more lawyers and saboteurs than scientists. They were also shown to be perfectly fine putting people in danger, or even straight up committing murder to get what they wanted.

Some time between when the boat left Isla Sorna and arrived in San Diego, one of BioSyn's saboteur teams boarded the ship, and killed the crew. It wouldn't have been too difficult; there are maybe a dozen unarmed men who don't expect to be attacked. However, while InGen might be willing to overlook how the T-Rex killed all their people, they *might* notice if the T-Rex somehow used military grade weapons to gun down the entire crew. So instead, they used knives, hacksaws, etc. to kill them. Later, when asked where the crew are, one man says ""All over the place"" and turns away in revulsion. BioSyn knew that most people wouldn't want to look to closely at a mutilated body, so they wouldn't check close enough to wonder how a T-Rex's giant blunt teeth managed to sever a hand with surgical precision. After that, they either just left the T-Rex in the hold if it started there, or lured it out of it's cage into the hold using dead corpses as bait. They then shut the hold doors, and left the remote very conspicuously in the hand of a crewmate, making sure the doors were banging together to draw attention. Finally, they kept the ship on course until they were close to the harbor, then bailed out, and escaped using their own boat.

Why do all that though? Simple: to publicly humiliate and destroy InGen. The T-Rex's arrival was going to be a massive triumph for InGen, the first time the world had really seen one of their new dinosaurs. Instead, it turned into a disaster, with hundreds dead or injured, and millions in property damage, as well as showing they had no real control over their dinosaurs. They were already in debt and struggling financially, so a fracas like that should have destroyed their company... allowing BioSyn to swoop in and buy them out at a low, low price, gaining access to all of their research, equipment, and scientists. That likely would have worked, were it not for Hammond taking the fall.

l8suph,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"The Lion King: Scar was the hero, Mufasa was the villain.Yes, I know, Scar murdered all our childhoods by killing Mufasa. But let's look at what the two *actually* did.

Mufasa ran the Pride lands, which *seemed* like a paradise. He gave a big speech about the circle of life, a system where the lions get the absolute best position. ""Sure, we kill the antelope, but then our bodies turn to grass, and they eat that, so it's OK"". Just consider how many antelope a full grow lion eats over the course of his life, only to produce enough grass to feed one, *maybe* two antelope for a day. It's basically just biological trickle down economics. But, as we know, predators play an important role in a biological ecosystem, right? As unfair as it is, Mufasa needs to keep that balance. But then *why* does he banish the hyenas? They play a vital role in the ecosystem. Contrary to popular belief, they're more than just scavengers, they're also formidable predators, getting about 80-90% of their food from hunting. Even when scavenging, they make sure food isn't wasted, and pick off older and weaker animals, thus stopping overpopulation. They're also extremely intelligent social animals, who will raise the cubs of dead hyenas, unlike *lions*. However, Mufasa chose to banish them to a place with no food or clean water to slowly die. ""We're all part of the circle of life son-- except those guys, fuck those guys, let 'em die"".

Compare that to Scar. Yes, he killed Mufasa and tried to kill Simba. *That's natural for a pride of lions.* Mufasa doesn't get to talk about how it's the ""natural order of things"" for him to kill others, yet be surprised when it happens to him. Real life lions *will* kill the cubs of the past pride leader, in order to cement their dominance, and since they're unable to make cubs of their own otherwise. Then, consider how he treats the hyenas. What's his one promise to them? Food. Not power, revenge, anything else, just the ability to not watch their children starve to death. Even when they take power, they don't attempt revenge on the lions. Yeah, there's obviously resentment, but they don't try to banish the lions like they'd been banished, or wipe them out entirely. In fact, they just want to live there *with* the lions, an impressive show of unity. Scar does treat them somewhat badly, insulting their intelligence and batting them around occasionally. Again, shows of strength are normal for lions, and while he may be condescending towards them, he kept his word to them. With the pride at his back, he easily could have wiped them out, but instead, chose to honor his promise. Even when there's a lack of food, Scar won't just let the hyenas die, he chooses to keep helping them. The movie then chooses to portray Scar as the villain, for causing the drought. Bull. Shit. The leaves and plants are shown to be dying and brown. That's not an issue that comes from overpopulation, that's an issue that comes from *drought*. Scar got blamed for a natural occurrence he had no control over. Then, Simba comes in, and it immediately rains, solving the issue.

l8reeu,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Star Wars: Why droids were made to feel painIn Return of the Jedi, R2 and C3PO pass by a droid torture chamber, where they see droids being burned by hot irons and screaming (RIP Gonk). C3PO screams when he gets shot by a blaster, and he shows repeated fear at the thought of any kind of physical harm or pain.

Compare that to Attack of the Clones, when he literally was decapitated, and had his head soldered onto a new body, cut off, then soldered onto a new one with only a few puns thrown in, and no sign of pain. The entire droid army advances even after being shot, and shows no real fear or reaction to pain. A magnaguard literally is half crushed, and still goes for it's staff.

**Droids after the Clone Wars had chips added to make them feel pain, to avoid them being used as soldiers again**.

The Clone Wars likely terrified the galaxy. Sure, highly trained clones could take down droids easily, but for your average civilian, even a basic B-1 droid could be a deadly threat. The Mandalorian shows us a brief clip of Separtists attacking a village that emphasizes how brutal those droids could be. Imagine an entire army that feels no pain, no fear, no exhaustion. Adding those chips was people's way of preventing any future war, or a robot revolution.",,,1612029598

l7vxzl,EquivalentInflation,harrypotter,"Theory: The Hogwarts founders sacrificed themselves in order to establish a protection for students at Hogwarts.(First off, I'm aware that I'm putting way too much thought into creating an in-universe explanation for plot armor. Don't judge me. I have a lot of time on my hands. If you don't want to read all this, just read the bolded parts)

The most important spell used in the Harry Potter books was the one Lily chose to cast over Harry. By *specifically choosing to die* out of love rather than choosing to live (that's why James's sacrifice did nothing), she created a protection for Harry capable of overpowering Avada Kedavra, the most powerful spell known to wizards. Harry then later chose to make that same deliberate sacrifice for his friends, causing all of Voldemort's spells to be harmless against them.

**The Founders of Hogwarts chose to sacrifice themselves in order in order to cast that same protection spell over the grounds of Hogwarts, to protect the students there.**

The books themselves even hint at it pretty clearly. Dumbledore mentions that ""The castle is a stronghold of ancient magic"" (notably, the only other time Dumbledore specifically mentions ancient magic is when he is explaining Harry's protection to him). When Ron discusses how Sirius broke into Hogwarts, Hermione says that ""This castle is protected by more than walls."". Finally, Hagrid tells Harry that ""Gringotts is the safest place there is-- 'cept maybe Hogwarts.""

It seems strange how people regard Hogwarts as safe, given the hundreds of underage witches and wizards with zero training all trying to do magic and make potions. Yet, when there was a single death (Myrtle), people flipped out, and considered closing the school. That indicates that death was incredibly uncommon.

**The Founders' spell altered situations and probability to help students escape mortal danger or severe harm**

This is basically required to just run the school, even without any of Harry &amp; co.'s hijinks. Students repeatedly test new spells on themselves and others in class, and brew potions that can turn toxic with even a small mistake. They deal with dangerous creatures on a near daily basis, and their one sport literally features hitting opponents with a 40 pound metal ball to try and knock them off their broom to a 50 foot drop. The protection spell makes sure all those situations end up safely (at least relatively so).

Let's just run through a list of examples:

**Pre-HP books:**

* Tom Riddle attempted to use the Basilisk while at Hogwarts, and Dippet mentions a series of attacks, yet Myrtle is the only death. We can assume there was a series of fantastic coincidences that managed to save them, just like his second attempt.

**Philosopher's Stone**

* Neville falls about 30 feet off his broom, and is completely fine
* Harry's broom is bewitched by Quirrel/Voldemort, a powerful dark wizard, yet manages to hang on.
* Harry, Ron, and Hermione get through a series of deadly traps, and take on Quirrel/Voldemort in person. Yes, Voldemort couldn't kill Harry, but the deadly plants, vicious chess pieces, and poison definitely could. Ron got crushed brutally by a stone chess piece and was fine.

**Chamber of Secrets:**

* During Riddle's second attempt, via diary, crazy coincidences kept happening: Colin is looking through a camera, Mrs. Norris is looking at a puddle, Ernie is looking through Nick, etc. How could six people/animals/ghosts (along with all the students from the first time) be that lucky?
* Ron carries around a defective wand for his second year, which constantly does spells wrong and backfires, eventually exploding with the force of a grenade. Despite that, there's never any permanent harm.
* Hermione takes a bad polyjuice potion, something that is e*xplicitly stated to be deadly*, or at minimum, horrifically painful, yet it's only a minor inconvenience. She also managed to brew Harry and Ron's perfectly, despite it being an incredibly difficult potion to make, even for skilled witches and wizards.
* Harry gets hit by a giant flying piece of metal, falls 40-50 feet to the ground, and only ends up with a broken arm.

**Prisoner of Azkaban:**

* Harry is attacked by dementors, somehow manages not to get his soul sucked out, and falls over a hundred feet, being conveniently caught by Dumbledore (who apparently didn't decide to save him the other time he fell off his broom).
* Malfoy is attacked by Buckbeak, and receives only a minor injury. He deliberately insulted a deadly, 600 pound beast with razor claws while Hagrid was halfway across the paddock, he should have been ground weasel meat.
* Lupin turns into a werewolf and rampages across the grounds, yet no one ends up being harmed, not even Sirius, who was a far smaller dog.
* Harry is surrounded by dozens of dementors, the most we've ever seen in one place, and manages to pull off the patronus charm. Yes, he had the whole confidence boost, but that's still an *insane* achievement, especially for a wizard his age.

**Goblet of Fire**

* First off, *literally every Triwizard task*. Seriously, they had to take on a dragon, dive into a dangerous lake, and go through a deadly maze. Even with all the ""precautions"" Dumbledore and the others took, it was still beyond dangerous.
* Snape mentions to the students that he's going to test their antidote knowledge *by poisoning one of them*. Knowing Snape, that's likely not a joke.
* Malfoy got turned into a ferret, then bounced off of the walls and ceiling. Hilarity aside, that should probably have resulted in a lot of broken bones and bruises, or even death.
* Barty Crouch used imperio to control Krum to attack Fleur and Cedric, but left them both alive. Why would he bother doing so? Krum used crucio, Avada Kedavara wouldn't have been out of the question.

**Order of the Phoenix**

* Umbridge tortures Harry by magically carving letters into his skin, which he never received medical help for (besides Hermione giving him some weird pus after a few times).
* Fred and George release flaming explosives into Hogwarts specifically designed to destroy things, as well as a full size swamp. Somehow, nobody got third degree burns or died.
* Montague was stuffed into a broken vanishing cabinet by the Weasley twins, and was trapped in a weird limbo. He then splinched his way out into a toilet (horrible brain image), but miraculously survived.
* McGonagall gets hit full on by five stunning spells. Madam Pomfrey flat out says that she should have died, especially with her age.
* Umbridge is flat out willing to use Crucio on Harry, and is only stopped by a *really* transparent distraction by Hermione

**Half Blood Prince**

* When Draco sneaks poison into Slughorn's gift for Dumbledore of mead, Slughorn instead decides to keep it, but not drink it. Thus, the poison is kept directly next to the man best suited to counteract potions, as well as who keeps a number of bezoars handy.
* It's unclear exactly where Katie is when she touches the cursed necklace, if she's on Hogwarts grounds or not, but she touches only the smallest bit of the necklace through a hole in her glove, surviving an otherwise deadly curse. Her survival also acts as a warning mechanism to save Dumbledore.
* Draco attempts to hit Harry with the Killing curse in the bathroom, but misses, at very close range
* Harry hits Draco with *sectumsempra,* a curse that slices open the body, and can't be healed by magic. At that exact moment, who's walking by but Snape, the *one person in the castle* who knows how to heal those wounds.
* During the battle at the astronomy tower, none of the Hogwarts students or Order members die. That's despite the fact that they're facing an elite Death Eater hit squad, who have all committed numerous murders. The DA members had Felix Felicis, but the Order members didn't. Bill came out the worst, with only some facial scarring.
* Dumbledore's death. Yes, he died. But note that he's not trying to save himself, and purposefully put himself in a position where the odds were stacked highly against him, even with manipulation by a protective spell. Had he attempted to survive, he likely could have.

**The Deathly Hallows**

* The general activities of the DA at Hogwarts. Seriously, you had a handful of teenagers going up against brutal torturers and killers, and emerging with only some cuts and bruises.
* The Battle of Hogwarts. Obviously, this seems like a bit of a hole in the theory: Plenty of Hogwarts students and allies died. But as we've seen throughout the series, any spell has it's limits, and it can't protect everyone. In addition, it's just a matter of chance. The spell can make it more likely that a student can dodge a hex, or a curse will miss them, but when it's happening hundreds, thousands of times, eventually their luck runs out. In all honesty, the fact that they managed to do as well as they did was incredibly impressive. The defenders only had about 20-25 trained, adult witches and wizards along with a bunch of teenagers, while the Death Eaters had a small army that was highly trained, with powerful dark magic.

**How did this happen?**

Let's get into the details now.

**The four founders were the ""most skilled witches and wizards of their age"". Given that they apparently built and enchanted Hogwarts alone, that seems like a fair assessment. They also all had a dedication to passing on their knowledge to future generations. However, a school full of kids learning magic is gonna have a lot of inherent dangers. Add on the persecution of witches and wizards at the time, and threat of dark wizard attacks, and there's plenty of potential reasons their school could collapse in a matter of years without them there to defend it. Unless... they could defend it forever somehow. Once the castle was done, by sacrificing themselves, they could protect students for as long as the enchantment stood. For Hufflepuff, this was done out of kindness and concern for others. For Ravenclaw, it was practicality and logic. She was already sick and dying, and her sacrifice could let numerous others seek wisdom. Gryffindor was known for his bravery and nobility, he'd likely jump at the chance to sacrifice himself. The only one who wouldn't was Slytherin, whose self interest prevented him from the sacrifice. This may very well have been the reason he left the group, an argument over whether or not to cast the enchantment. (Interestingly, Slytherin is the only founder we have specific knowledge on his death and burial site). The spell likely required some preparation, as it was extremely complex. That long time preparing may even have been the reason Ravenclaw was sick. In the end, all three founders sacrificed themselves, in order to ensure a better future for their students.**",,,1611935577

But he really, really wasn't a good teacher. The books even adress it, with a lot of the Gryffindors, and even Hermione realizing Hagrid wasn't all that great. *That doesn't mean he's not a good person*, but he shouldn't be able to keep teaching. Part of it is the danger, but also, he doesn't seem to have much of a lesson plan. He jumped around from topic to topic, and often taught according to his own whims, rather than an established plan, or the school's reccomendation. Compared to Grubbly Plank, who had interesting topics geared towards the age of the students, taught well, and had a set plan, Hagrid looks a whole lot worse. Yes, Hagrid's class had it's moments, but it seemed like it was more about making Hagrid feel happy and fulfilled than making students learn.",,,1611857181

Future games should limit the number of skills you can unlock, letting you choose to be an all-around fighter, or a specialist. That lets players choose their own path and playstyle, without running into difficulties with the whole Animus plot device.

It also would give far more meaning to the skill tree, and force people to think it out. I don't know about anyone else, but generally, I'll scroll around, find something that looks moderately useful, and pick it. Having a limited number of abilities would make players have to consider their choices more, and plan out their skill tree in advance.

l5hfjh,EquivalentInflation,harrypotter,"Theory: Azkaban isn't a prison for wizards... it's a prison for dementors.One of the first things we learn about Azkaban is how absolutely horrible it is. Hagrid nearly has a breakdown when he's told he's going there for a few weeks, and is noticeably affected afterwards. Fudge is visibly ill just thinking about making a short trip, and Ron mentions that his dad was shaking and exhausted after just a few hours there on ministry business. From everything Sirius tells us, and what we later see with Death Eaters, Azkaban is capable of driving someone insane, and making them lose the will to live. This shows us that Dementors are incredibly dangerous, possibly the most dangerous things in Harry Potter. To the best of our knowledge, they can't be killed, and can drive someone mad just by standing near them, as well as their ""kiss"".

After Voldemort comes back, the dementors leave Azkaban, and start terrorizing Muggles. Fudge also mentions that they've begun breeding (good luck getting *that* image out of your brain). It'd be essentially impossible for the Ministry to fight them, and we don't see any evidence of them trying to do so. Taking down even one or two requires the patronus charm, something very few wizards can do.

Clearly, letting Dementors run free would be incredibly dangerous. They'd be a severe threat to both wizards and muggles alike (maybe 10% of adult wizards could manage to fight them off, at *best*), and they'd likely end up destroying the statute of secrecy. Thousands could lose their souls, and millions more would face horrible depression and fear.

We know that the Ministry has barely any control over the dementors. Voldemort basically just asks them to join him, and they do. When they're at Hogwarts, they all abandon their posts and attack children, and the ministry is powerless to stop them. Same with Barty Crouch Jr: Fudge is right there, yet can't stop the Dementor from sucking out his soul.

Azkaban acts as a sort of prison for dementors. They're given a constant supply of free prey without having to work for it, who they can make miserable. The ministry sacrifices some of their worst prisoners, the people their society won't care about. They also then get the added bonus of dissuading crime through fear.

l4utaw,EquivalentInflation,harrypotter,"Theory: Slughorn used Felix Felicis before dueling VoldemortThis is just a thought I had during a reread.

Slughorn is an incredibly skilled potions maker, but throughout the series, he's never shown or mentioned having any talent at dueling, in addition to being rather cowardly and self serving. When McGonagall threatens to duel him to the death should he betray her, he flinches, and is extremely frightened. However, just hours later, he then helps McGonagall and Kingsley duel Voldemort himself.

So, how did he manage to take on one of the deadliest wizards of all time, even with help?

**Slughorn had prepared an emergency stash of Felix Felicis, which he used before the battle**.

In *The Half Blood Prince,* Slughorn gives out eight hours worth of Felix Felicis, the ""Liquid luck"" potion. Notably, he gives it out as a prize in class, the same way another teacher might offer a lollipop to students. If he's willing to be that generous with it, he has to have a decent supply for himself, or at least the capacity to make more. We even see that the cauldron he makes is far larger than what he gives Harry. Hypothetically, the Ministry regulates the brewing of it, but Slughorn has shown to be willing to break laws in the past (Acromantula fangs for the black market), and it seems fair to say that Voldemort's focus after taking over wasn't on bureaucratic administration.

Liquid Luck doesn't just make the user lucky, it fills them with self confidence. Slughorn was obviously terrified by Voldemort, and fled at first, but the potion gave him the courage to come back, and even face Voldemort head on.

After looking into this more, I found that they actually included it in the movies. [At 17 seconds into this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tpb1XyqGOQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=WizardingWorld), you can see Slughorn in the background taking a swig from a very small bottle right before the battle.",,,1611601414

From what we can tell, it seems to require far more than just a wand and word pronunciation. There has to be some kind of specific situation, with certain things being sacrificed or connected somehow, making it far more unpredictable and difficult to achieve.

However, it also seems to be far more powerful due to that, and can't be undone by simpler spells. In terms of a magic war, it would be the equivalent of a nuclear weapon. 

It would be super interesting to see this kind of magic used in the Fantastic Beast movies. We could get a more in depth look on a really interesting part of the universe we hadn't seen before.

The spell can make it more likely that a student can dodge a hex, or a curse will miss them, but when it's happening hundreds, thousands of times, eventually their luck runs out. In all honesty, the fact that they managed to do as well as they did was incredibly impressive. The defenders only had about 20-25 trained, adult witches and wizards along with a bunch of teenagers, while the Death Eaters had a small army that was highly trained, with powerful dark magic.

**How did this happen?**

Let's get into the details now.

**The four founders were the ""most skilled witches and wizards of their age"". Given that they apparently built and enchanted Hogwarts alone, that seems like a fair assessment. They also all had a dedication to passing on their knowledge to future generations. However, a school full of kids learning magic is gonna have a lot of inherent dangers. Add on the persecution of witches and wizards at the time, and threat of dark wizard attacks, and there's plenty of potential reasons their school could collapse in a matter of years without them there to defend it. Unless... they could defend it forever somehow. Once the castle was done, by sacrificing themselves, they could protect students for as long as the enchantment stood. For Hufflepuff, this was done out of kindness and concern for others. For Ravenclaw, it was practicality and logic. She was already sick and dying, and her sacrifice could let numerous others seek wisdom. Gryffindor was known for his bravery and nobility, he'd likely jump at the chance to sacrifice himself. The only one who wouldn't was Slytherin, whose self interest prevented him from the sacrifice. This may very well have been the reason he left the group, an argument over whether or not to cast the enchantment. (Interestingly, Slytherin is the only founder we have specific knowledge on his death and burial site). The spell likely required some preparation, as it was extremely complex. That long time preparing may even have been the reason Ravenclaw was sick. In the end, all three founders sacrificed themselves, in order to ensure a better future for their students.**",,,1611589605

Eventually, the bartender gets sick of it. 

""Look:"" he says ""people are dumb. Anybody could covert someone to a religion. Hell, half the guys i this bar would turn Hindu if I offered them a free beer.

All of them look at each other nervously, but a mix of alcohol and pride make them all agree to it. They decide to meet up a week later to discuss how they did.

The priest comes in with his arm in a sling, and scratches and cuts all over his face, beaming from ear to ear. ""Well,"" he said, ""it wasn't easy, but I did it!

Bruce then tells them that he's had Alfred detonate explosives in the Batcave, and has left them with a smaller base instead. At the end, when the Court is revealed, it zooms in on a metal box they have, where the glowing eyes of a Talon (the court's enforcers/assassins) appear.

**The Court of Owls captured and brainwashed Batman, turning him into a Talon**

They've shown their ability to do just that multiple times, using a combination of mind altering drugs and surgery to make Talons completely loyal to the Court. The Court has also repeatedly shown a massive interest in Batman. Turning him to their side would give them a deadly weapon, enhancing Batman's agility, strength, speed, and combat training with their own serum, which gives regeneration powers and vastly increases physical ability.

That's also why Batman had the Batcave destroyed. Since the Court knows his secret identity, they'd be able to find it easily, and use the weapons and information he stored there. The Court likely wouldn't know about his second base, and from what we've seen of the forced conversion process (different from most Talons), it doesn't leave them with much intelligence or memory of a past life. That would mean the Court couldn't get the new location from him.

As a storyline (and as a Video game), it'd make a lot of sense for Batman to come back, similar to how Red Hood was slowly revealed to be Jason Todd in a previous Arkham game. It'd also offer a good boss fight for the finale, as well as added personal drama, and a quality plot twist.",,,1611335479

l2gkto,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Community: Abed is trying to get people to ship him with TroyThis is gonna sound super crazy, but hear me out:

Abed breaks the fourth wall repeatedly throughout the show, as well as making plenty of meta-references about trying to boost their ratings, what future episodes they should do, etc. Nobody really knows if he's aware he's in a show, or if he's just crazy, but the point still stands: He's trying to make his life fit a TV show.

Throughout the show, Abed and Troy are shown to be very close, and Abed keeps dropping hints and jokes about there being more. He refers to them as ""Trobed"" (their couple name), he talks about adopting a baby they found and raising it together, doing the ""I love you"" ""I know"" scene, making eye contact and waggling his eyebrows at Troy when Jeff talked about coupling up, etc. Other characters jokingly refer to them as being boyfriends, and a running gag was having them meet new people who thought they were a couple. ([This has a lot more if you're interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tid_OYR2ZZI&amp;ab_channel=grecia)).

The thing is, if Abed legitimately did like Troy romantically, he had plenty of chances to tell him. They literally moved in together, and were extremely close. So, why the flirting and jokes?

**Abed wants viewers to ship him with Troy**

Shippers for any fandom can go crazy over even the slightest hint, something Abed would know given his established love for Marvel, Harry Potter, etc. He also has an established love for ""will they won't they"" relationships, describing Jeff and Britta as such repeatedly. Building up a potential romance for himself and Troy would appeal both to his meta instincts, and his love for TV.",,,1611291790

When caught, he claimed that he was doing it to try and kill the Jedi, since they were killing clones with poor leadership... despite the fact that he also helped kill clones. It's also strange because the clones generally had training and ""programming"" that kept them loyal, with only a tiny handful of errors out of millions.

**Palpatine used the control chips to order Slick to turn against the Republic as a test**

The control chips were the core of Palpatine's plan to seize control of the Republic, and kill the Jedi. He wasn't going to wait until the moment he needed them to do a test, he had to make sure they worked. They likely did lab tests, but in the field, clones started becoming more and more unique as individuals, taking on names, and personalizing their armor. Palpatine needed a field test to make sure the chip would still function properly. 

Slick betrayed his brothers, something of immense magnitude for clones. When Obi Wan floats the possibility that a clone could have helped Ventress, Cody immediately gets defensive. You can see how shocked Rex and Cody are when they find out the traitor is a clone; the idea that one of their brothers would turn on them was horrifying to them.

By forcing Slick to do something he found morally abhorrent, Palpatine was confident that the chips could hold up to any stress. If Slick was willing to kill his own brothers, killing a close friend like a Jedi would be easy for clones.",,,1611253202

l1dghl,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Community: The asscrack bandit was three people: Duncan, Annie, and AbedSo, one of the biggest questions about Community that has never been answered is the identity of the ""ass crack bandit"", a serial prankster who put quarters in between people's butt cheeks when they bent over. The bandit had one famous spree during season 2 that was briefly mentioned at the time (Annie's presidential speech promises to catch him). The bandit then did nothing for roughly a year, until they returned in season 5 for an episode parodying crime shows. Finally, we have the answer:

**The reason the bandit was so hard to find was that it was not one, not two, but three separate perpetrators. Duncan was the original bandit, who got caught and was forced to stop. Annie then became a copycat in order to create a crime only she could solve, until Abed hijacked it in order to make it more like TV.**

Duncan was the original bandit, continuing his spree for over a year. He was able to ""crack"" three students only ten minutes apart using the faculty lounge; as Annie pointed out, it was the only possible way for a person to get to all three spots in time. He also sent in a letter based on lyrics from the Dave Matthews band, which he loved (the letter Jeff referenced wasn't shown being found at the time, and was likely from the original spree).

Duncan was finally caught by Dean Craig Pelton, and forced to stop. However, Pelton didn't want to reveal publicly that Duncan was the bandit, as it would cause a PR nightmare. That's why he's so combative later when Annie suggests the ACB could be a teacher: He was worried his cover-up could fall apart. That scene was extremely out of character for him, and he has no other motivation. Duncan even mentions he'd left for a while, which he could have been blackmailed into doing in order to avoid suspicion.

Annie then picked up the mantle of bandit. She was shown with a massive scrapbook containing details on the bandit's crimes, psychological profiles, and newspaper clippings. Annie's goal was to create a crime only she could solve (and possibly get an excuse to run around with Jeff, like others accused her of). She was a criminology student, and solving a crime like that could be a big deal for her studies. She may have figured out that Duncan was the bandit, or may have just suspected a teacher. Either way, she could then commit a series of ""crackings"", use her vast knowledge on the subject to track down the real bandit, and pin it on them. She gets blown off at first, causing her to crack Troy.

Troy gets caught because the bandit left out a teddy bear as a trap, baiting him into bending over. That's pretty different from all of the other bandit attacks, which occurred in public places, and were crimes of opportunity. This is a premediated trap, specifically designed for Troy. Who knows Troy very well, and also has a large collection of stuffed animals? Dean Pelton has already shown repeatedly he favors the study group. An attack on Garrett might be brushed off, but Annie knew one on Troy would spark a major public reaction, which it did. Annie is then the one to find the ACB's message stuffed inside the ""butt"" of the teddy bear. Since she and Hickey arrived only a few minutes previously, it seems odd that the biggest clue would be something she immediately found.

However, Annie made one critical mistake-- messing with Troy. Abed figured out she was the bandit relatively easily. Although he's horrible reading people's emotions, he's been shown to be very good at figuring out what people are doing or thinking. He's able to figure out Jeff and Britta slept together just by listening to a few seconds of conversation. He also showed a willingness and ability to manipulate others-- becoming a chicken mob boss, keeping charts on menstrual cycles and acting accordingly, making up an entire fake language and spending tons of money to mess with Troy, etc. He also has shown an interest in making life more like TV. When Annie and Shirley become security guards, he states that it's a perfect buddy cop show, and follows them around for entertainment, as well as stepping in to make sure the show's ""formula"" stays. Abed decides to make the situation into a crime TV show (he's shown at the end with his DVR, going through episodes of *the Bridge* and *Hannibal*, both of which are gritty shows that sometimes deal with serial killers, just like this episode). He also does it partly out of revenge for Troy.

Abed is then the one to crack Vicky at the rally. He's shown next to Troy, but when the cracking happens, the camera cuts back over, and he's gone. Already back in Season 1, he was established to be an extremely fast runner, faster even than star quarterback Troy Barnes. He could easily have made it over in time. He then leaves the pre-recorded message for Dean Pelton, Jeff and Annie. If you look at Annie's face during the call, she seems shocked, something she hadn't been even when one of her close friends got cracked. She's that surprised because *she was not in control*. We see this later, when she tells Jeff they should just give up on the case, even knowing that Starburns is innocent. She's afraid because the investigation is no longer following her plan, and doesn't want to be caught. Also, an analysis of the Bandit's message shows the same speech pattern as Abed. The filter disguises the sound of the voice, but not speed or pacing.

Abed also refuses to take part in the investigation, mocking the Dean for wanting a ""mildly autistic super-detective"". The odd part? *They weren't parodying those shows*. The episode was a parody of dark and gritty serial killer crime shows. That seems like a small thing, but in every other parody episode (Zombies, Diehard, Mad Max, Law and Order, etc.) he always makes a meta-reference to it, and plays along. The fact that he completely missed a TV reference, *and* passed up the opportunity to take part in a ""real life TV show"" is incredibly suspicious.

Then, there's the ending, one of the biggest clues it's Abed: A piece of evidence comes up that points to someone who ends up being innocent, and the detectives are the only ones who believe their innocence. They then find who they believe to be the guilty party-- who gets ""cracked"" right before they get caught. Seem familiar? That's because it shows up in nearly every crime TV show. The ACB manipulated events to fit that plot-- leading them to Star Burns, cracking Duncan, etc. Abed then planned to end that escapade with a classic TV killer move-- running down a dead end, only to not be there when the cops arrive. However, that was interrupted by Shirely with the news of Pierce's death.

At the end of the episode, there's a montage of potential suspects, all of whom are red herrings. Britta is shown to make a typing error in her psych paper, inserting her own name instead of ""Bandit"". However, she's well known for her screw ups, which explains the typo, and makes her pulling off numerous well planned crimes unlikely. Shirley is shown to benefit monetarily from the Dean banning change, as well as selling T-shirts, but she's shown onscreen to be too far away from multiple crackings, and likely would be too moral. Hickey is also shown looking at a newspaper headline of his biggest failure, not catching a serial killer. In general, he seems to look down on silly things like this, and does all he can to not take part in the investigation (if he were the bandit, he'd use his position as head investigator to cover up his tracks. The lunchlady and Rhonda the secretary are also both shown, but since they have little motivation and screentime, it seems fair to rule them out as red herrings. Finally, there's Abed, rolling a quarter across his knuckles with remarkable dexterity, at the same time as he deletes serial killer TV shows from his DVR. Abed has no reason to be that skilled with a quarter, and the fact that he's watched those shows makes his slip up earlier even more suspicious",,,1611162681

l0s9wl,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Harry Potter: Slughorn used Felix Felicis before dueling VoldemortThis is just a thought I had during a reread.

Slughorn is an incredibly skilled potions maker, but throughout the series, he's never shown or mentioned having any talent at dueling, in addition to being rather cowardly and self serving. When McGonagall threatens to duel him to the death should he betray her, he flinches, and is extremely frightened. However, just hours later, he then helps McGonagall and Kingsley duel Voldemort himself. 

So, how did he manage to take on one of the deadliest wizards of all time, even with help?

**Slughorn had prepared an emergency stash of Felix Felicis, which he used before the battle**.

In *The Half Blood Prince,* Slughorn gives out eight hours worth of Felix Felicis, the ""Liquid luck"" potion. Notably, he gives it out as a prize in class, the same way another teacher might offer a lollipop to students. If he's willing to be that generous with it, he has to have a decent supply for himself, or at least the capacity to make more. We even see that the cauldron he makes is far larger than what he gives Harry. Hypothetically, the Ministry regulates the brewing of it, but Slughorn has shown to be willing to break laws in the past (Acromantula fangs for the black market), and it seems fair to say that Voldemort's focus after taking over wasn't on bureaucratic administration. 

Liquid Luck doesn't just make the user lucky, it fills them with self confidence. Slughorn was obviously terrified by Voldemort, and fled at first, but the potion gave him the courage to come back, and even face Voldemort head on.",,,1611087629
l0rfd1,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Community: Buzz Hickey was a serial killerThere's a ton of theories about ""X character was a serial killer"". However, in this case, there's actuall evidence. Hickey is an ex-detective who is still obsessed over a serial killer who was never caught. However, in the scenes where Hickey is looking over the headlines showing the killer's escape, and the news of him being removed from the force, he's not angry or sad. *He's smirking.*

From the pieces of the newspaper we can see, Hickey had some kind of confrontation (possibly violent) with another officer over the handling of the Ripper case. He was then removed from the force ""temporarily"", but was never allowed back. Another newspaper clipping shows that two detectives were removed permanently from the force for ""mishandling materials and tampering with evidence"". In addition, the newspapers state that the Ripper was meticulous, and planned out each killing well, making it nearly impossible to find them. Finally, Hickey also states that""I was in the storm drain lair of the Black River Ripper. I have seen human heads used for things other than heads"". Interestingly, none of the newspapers ever mention the lair being found.

All of that seems to paint a very clear picture:

* The killings were planned out in detail, in such a way that the killer couldn't be found, and there were no clues. Who could avoid detection better than a detective with years of experience in crime scenes? As head detective on the case, he'd be uniquely situated to cover up any leads.
* He got into a large confrontation with another cop over assigning resources to the case. That wording is odd, especially since Hickey mentions the department wanted to cover the case up. The other officer likely wanted to scale down the investigation, which Hickey objected to. Serial killers are often megalomaniacs, and want their work to be known, so he could easily see that as a threat.
* Hickey and another cop tampered with evidence. Maybe he slipped up, and left something behind at a crime scene. Or potentially, the other cop found the river lair that Hickey mentioned. Hickey was worried it could lead to him, so he convinced the other detective to go in ahead of forensics, thus disturbing the scene, and creating a convenient excuse for his DNA to be there.
* Hickey was quietly fired in a way that avoided any big public show, and he described it as ""a coverup"". Maybe his bosses got suspicious about him, but didn't have the evidence to back it up.

There's also a large number of police officers in real life who have used their positions to commit numerous murders, so many that it's now an official profile type for serial killers. Hickey is repeatedly shown to hate his former department, and goes on a rant about how terrible the city government is, criticizing their inefficiency, and all the mistakes they made. Many serial killers have convoluted moral reasoning for their crimes, and Hickey may have committed his in order to shine a light on how terribly the police handled matters.

Finally, Hickey shows repeated traits of psychopathy. He's a professor of criminology, and apparently good enough at engineering to build a large machine for the hot lava competition, so intelligence fits. He has a bad relationship with his son who he ignored for years. Even when they finally become somewhat close, Hickey never expresses any emotion, just respect for his determination and cutthroat instincts, so incapacity for love fits. Although Hickey is a very gruff person, he does plenty of favors for people, and by the end of the season, is shown to be on friendly terms with everyone in the study group, despite lack of interest in any of them, so superficial charm would fit pretty well. He also is shown to fit the manipulative trait well, handcuffing Abed to teach him a lesson he wants, forcing Annie to go through bureaucracy, etc. He also has a history in both the military and police, and has referenced brutal violence repeatedly without any display of emotion.

All in all, Hickey fits the profile of a serial killer perfectly. He's ruthless, intelligent, and has the knowledge and skills to pull it off. But the biggest hint to it all is him looking at the newspapers that ruined his career. It's not the look of a broken man, or a man who regrets something. It's the satisfied smile of a man who got away with something, a man who is pleased with how things turned out.",,,1611085234
l0pncr,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Star Wars: Jedi become more powerful by accepting their deathDeath, and coming to terms with it has been a major theme in Star Wars. The Jedi greet it and accept it, while the Sith seek to cheat it. However, many Jedi also avoid death throughout the series, even in cases where their sacrifice might be required by the force.

This also fits well with our understanding of the force. Yoda states ""Do or do not, there is no try"". A Jedi must commit themselves fully to something in order to succeed, and how much more committed than you get than giving up your own life?

It also fits the symbolism of the series pretty well, as well as Palpatine's story: He rose to power because Yoda wasn't willing to die, and retreated. He then was defeated by Vader sacrificing his life, and later by Rey sacrificing hers. Palpatine's entire motivation was trying to gain immortality, protecting his own life, and the only way to defeat him was to give up one's life. It's like poetry... it rhymes.

Let's run through some examples:

* Obi Wan Kenobi
   * Obviously, the biggest example of this. He gives in to Darth Vader, and even states that he ""Will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine"". By accepting death like a Jedi, he manages to become a force ghost successfully, something no Jedi had ever done (Qui Gon only got halfway).
* Qui Gon Jinn
   * We see Qui Gon sit down and meditate shortly before his death. In this moment, he likely realized that he'd die, using his precognition. By accepting that calmly, he managed to help save Obi Wan (Maul *should* have been fast enough to cut him in half, but he flew up far faster, almost like someone used the force to pull him...). He also managed to become a partial force ghost, but didn't understand the technique well enough.
* Kanan Jarrus
   * Kanan knew about his death ahead of time, and was warned by the Lothwolves. However, he still continued on in his quest to protect others, even at the cost of his own life, fulfilling the Jedi code. He then gained enough power to hold back a massive explosion, an incredible feat of strength and force ability.
* Ahsoka Tano
   * When Ahsoka was saved by Ezra using the World Between Worlds, she seemed surprised, and momentarily wondered if she was dead. She went into the fight with Vader with no hope of survival, but only a desire, however unlikely, to save Anakin. Despite her statements, she was a true Jedi. The last time Ahsoka fought a Sith was Maul, who beat her in a duel, while she managed to trick him. Vader is far, far more powerful, yet she goes toe to toe with him, and even manages to injure him.
* Yoda (RotS)
   * Yoda fighting against Palpatine is the perfect example of this failing. When trying to hold back Palpatine's lightning, Yoda fails, and falls to the Senate floor, and then makes his escape. In that moment, Yoda felt fear, and thought first of his own life, causing him to lose. That's why he's so ashamed afterwards, and why he cuts himself off from the galaxy: He had a shot to save everyone, but failed, due to his own flaws.
* Yoda (RotJ)
   * Yoda's actual death however allows him to become a force ghost, an impressive feat only Obi Wan had managed. He lets go of his worries, and lets himself die, without a 100% guarantee he'll be a ghost. That shows how much he'd grown since RotJ, and how he'd finally cast off his faults to embrace the Jedi philosphy.
* Anakin
   * Anakin is interesting, since he shows both the Sith and Jedi views. In RotS, he refuses to let himself die, holding on by sheer force of will, like a Sith. He's afraid of what comes next, and avoids it at all costs. However, in RotJ, he finally lets go of that, and accepts his death in order to save his son, gaining the power to not just defeat Palpatine, but to become a force ghost with no training.
* Ezra Bridger
   * Ezra chooses to sacrifice himself in order to remove Thrawn. He may have survived, but the chance he took was incredibly risky, and death was a very likely possibility. His sacrifice let him interact with the Purrgil, as well as making sure Thrawn didn't escape, and the Empire couldn't react in time.
* Luke Skywalker
   * Luke sacrifices himself saving Leia and the Resistance. He finally accepts the Jedi code, after years of denying it, just in time to trade his life for theirs. He manages to not only force project across the entire galaxy, but to become a force ghost after.
* Rey
   * When Rey is dueling Kylo Ren on Starkiller base, she's losing for the first half of the fight. He keeps driving her back, and she's filled with fear. However, she then takes a moment to pause, and breathe, calming herself, after which, she manages to push Kylo back and defeat him. Chewie was coming in to their area, and would be able to rescue Finn, so she planned on sacrificing herself to distract Kylo long enough for Chewie to save Finn. She then planned a similar sacrifice on Exegol to defeat Palpatine.",,,1611080297
l0orut,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Community: The asscrack bandit was three people: Duncan, Annie, and AbedSo, one of the biggest questions about Community that has never been answered is the identity of the ""ass crack bandit"", a serial prankster who put quarters in between people's butt cheeks when they bent over. The bandit had one famous spree during season 2 that was briefly mentioned at the time (Annie's presidential speech promises to catch him). The bandit then did nothing for roughly a year, until they returned in season 5 for an episode parodying crime shows. Finally, we have the answer:

**The reason the bandit was so hard to find was that it was not one, not two, but three separate perpetrators. Duncan was the original bandit, who got caught and was forced to stop. Annie then became a copycat in order to create a crime only she could solve, until Abed hijacked it in order to make it more like TV.**

Duncan was the original bandit, continuing his spree for over a year. He was able to ""crack"" three students only ten minutes apart using the faculty lounge; as Annie pointed out, it was the only possible way for a person to get to all three spots in time. He also sent in a letter based on lyrics from the Dave Matthews band, which he loved (the letter Jeff referenced wasn't shown being found at the time, and was likely from the original spree).

Duncan was finally caught by Dean Craig Pelton, and forced to stop. However, Pelton didn't want to reveal publicly that Duncan was the bandit, as it would cause a PR nightmare. That's why he's so combative later when Annie suggests the ACB could be a teacher: He was worried his cover-up could fall apart. That scene was extremely out of character for him, and he has no other motivation. Duncan even mentions he'd left for a while, which he could have been blackmailed into doing in order to avoid suspicion.

Annie then picked up the mantle of bandit. She was shown with a massive scrapbook containing details on the bandit's crimes, psychological profiles, and newspaper clippings. Annie's goal was to create a crime only she could solve (and possibly get an excuse to run around with Jeff, like others accused her of). She was a criminology student, and solving a crime like that could be a big deal for her studies. She may have figured out that Duncan was the bandit, or may have just suspected a teacher. Either way, she could then commit a series of ""crackings"", use her vast knowledge on the subject to track down the real bandit, and pin it on them. She gets blown off at first, causing her to crack Troy.

Troy gets caught because the bandit left out a teddy bear as a trap, baiting him into bending over. That's pretty different from all of the other bandit attacks, which occurred in public places, and were crimes of opportunity. This is a premediated trap, specifically designed for Troy. Who knows Troy very well, and also has a large collection of stuffed animals? Dean Pelton has already shown repeatedly he favors the study group. An attack on Garrett might be brushed off, but Annie knew one on Troy would spark a major public reaction, which it did. Annie is then the one to find the ACB's message stuffed inside the ""butt"" of the teddy bear. Since she and Hickey arrived only a few minutes previously, it seems odd that the biggest clue would be something she immediately found.

However, Annie made one critical mistake-- messing with Troy. Abed figured out she was the bandit relatively easily. Although he's horrible reading people's emotions, he's been shown to be very good at figuring out what people are doing or thinking. He's able to figure out Jeff and Britta slept together just by listening to a few seconds of conversation. He also showed a willingness and ability to manipulate others-- becoming a chicken mob boss, keeping charts on menstrual cycles and acting accordingly, making up an entire fake language and spending tons of money to mess with Troy, etc. He also has shown an interest in making life more like TV. When Annie and Shirley become security guards, he states that it's a perfect buddy cop show, and follows them around for entertainment, as well as stepping in to make sure the show's ""formula"" stays. Abed decides to make the situation into a crime TV show (he's shown at the end with his DVR, going through episodes of *the Bridge* and *Hannibal*, both of which are gritty shows that sometimes deal with serial killers, just like this episode). He also does it partly out of revenge for Troy.

Abed is then the one to crack Vicky at the rally. He's shown next to Troy, but when the cracking happens, the camera cuts back over, and he's gone. Already back in Season 1, he was established to be an extremely fast runner, faster even than star quarterback Troy Barnes. He could easily have made it over in time. He then leaves the pre-recorded message for Dean Pelton, Jeff and Annie. If you look at Annie's face during the call, she seems shocked, something she hadn't been even when one of her close friends got cracked. She's that surprised because *she was not in control*. We see this later, when she tells Jeff they should just give up on the case, even knowing that Starburns is innocent. She's afraid because the investigation is no longer following her plan, and doesn't want to be caught. Also, an analysis of the Bandit's message shows the same speech pattern as Abed. The filter disguises the sound of the voice, but not speed or pacing.

Abed also refuses to take part in the investigation, mocking the Dean for wanting a ""mildly autistic super-detective"". The odd part? *They weren't parodying those shows*. The episode was a parody of dark and gritty serial killer crime shows. That seems like a small thing, but in every other parody episode (Zombies, Diehard, Mad Max, Law and Order, etc.) he always makes a meta-reference to it, and plays along. The fact that he completely missed a TV reference, *and* passed up the opportunity to take part in a ""real life TV show"" is incredibly suspicious.

Then, there's the ending, one of the biggest clues it's Abed: A piece of evidence comes up that points to someone who ends up being innocent, and the detectives are the only ones who believe their innocence. They then find who they believe to be the guilty party-- who gets ""cracked"" right before they get caught. Seem familiar? That's because it shows up in nearly every crime TV show. The ACB manipulated events to fit that plot-- leading them to Star Burns, cracking Duncan, etc. Abed then planned to end that escapade with a classic TV killer move-- running down a dead end, only to not be there when the cops arrive. However, that was interrupted by Shirely with the news of Pierce's death.

At the end of the episode, there's a montage of potential suspects, all of whom are red herrings. Britta is shown to make a typing error in her psych paper, inserting her own name instead of ""Bandit"". However, she's well known for her screw ups, which explains the typo, and makes her pulling off numerous well planned crimes unlikely. Shirley is shown to benefit monetarily from the Dean banning change, as well as selling T-shirts, but she's shown onscreen to be too far away from multiple crackings, and likely would be too moral. Hickey is also shown looking at a newspaper headline of his biggest failure, not catching a serial killer. In general, he seems to look down on silly things like this, and does all he can to not take part in the investigation (if he were the bandit, he'd use his position as head investigator to cover up his tracks. The lunchlady and Rhonda the secretary are also both shown, but since they have little motivation and screentime, it seems fair to rule them out as red herrings. Finally, there's Abed, rolling a quarter across his knuckles with remarkable dexterity, at the same time as he deletes serial killer TV shows from his DVR. Abed has no reason to be that skilled with a quarter, and the fact that he's watched those shows makes his slip up earlier even more suspicious.",,,1611077870
l0nqzq,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Community: Buzz Hickey was the serial killer ""The Black River Ripper""There's a ton of theories about ""X character was a serial killer"". However, in this case, there's actuall evidence. Hickey is an ex-detective who is still obsessed over a serial killer who was never caught. However, in the scenes where Hickey is looking over the headlines showing the killer's escape, and the news of him being removed from the force, he's not angry or sad. *He's smirking.*

From the pieces of the newspaper we can see, Hickey had some kind of confrontation (possibly violent) with another officer over the handling of the Ripper case. He was then removed from the force ""temporarily"", but was never allowed back. Another newspaper clipping shows that two detectives were removed permanently from the force for ""mishandling materials and tampering with evidence"". In addition, the newspapers state that the Ripper was meticulous, and planned out each killing well, making it nearly impossible to find them. Finally, Hickey also states that""I was in the storm drain lair of the Black River Ripper. I have seen human heads used for things other than heads"". Interestingly, none of the newspapers ever mention the lair being found.

All of that seems to paint a very clear picture:

* The killings were planned out in detail, in such a way that the killer couldn't be found, and there were no clues. Who could avoid detection better than a detective with years of experience in crime scenes? As head detective on the case, he'd be uniquely situated to cover up any leads.
* He got into a large confrontation with another cop over assigning resources to the case. That wording is odd, especially since Hickey mentions the department wanted to cover the case up. The other officer likely wanted to scale down the investigation, which Hickey objected to. Serial killers are often megalomaniacs, and want their work to be known, so he could easily see that as a threat.
* Hickey and another cop tampered with evidence. Maybe he slipped up, and left something behind at a crime scene. Or potentially, the other cop found the river lair that Hickey mentioned. Hickey was worried it could lead to him, so he convinced the other detective to go in ahead of forensics, thus disturbing the scene, and creating a convenient excuse for his DNA to be there.
* Hickey was quietly fired in a way that avoided any big public show, and he described it as ""a coverup"". Maybe his bosses got suspicious about him, but didn't have the evidence to back it up.

There's also a large number of police officers in real life who have used their positions to commit numerous murders, so many that it's now an official profile type for serial killers. Hickey is repeatedly shown to hate his former department, and goes on a rant about how terrible the city government is, criticizing their inefficiency, and all the mistakes they made. Many serial killers have convoluted moral reasoning for their crimes, and Hickey may have committed his in order to shine a light on how terribly the police handled matters.

Finally, Hickey shows repeated traits of psychopathy. He's a professor of criminology, and apparently good enough at engineering to build a large machine for the hot lava competition, so intelligence fits. He has a bad relationship with his son who he ignored for years. Even when they finally become somewhat close, Hickey never expresses any emotion, just respect for his determination and cutthroat instincts, so incapacity for love fits. Although Hickey is a very gruff person, he does plenty of favors for people, and by the end of the season, is shown to be on friendly terms with everyone in the study group, despite lack of interest in any of them, so superficial charm would fit pretty well. He also is shown to fit the manipulative trait well, handcuffing Abed to teach him a lesson he wants, forcing Annie to go through bureaucracy, etc. He also has a history in both the military and police, and has referenced brutal violence repeatedly without any display of emotion.

All in all, Hickey fits the profile of a serial killer perfectly. He's ruthless, intelligent, and has the knowledge and skills to pull it off. But the biggest hint to it all is him looking at the newspapers that ruined his career. It's not the look of a broken man, or a man who regrets something. It's the satisfied smile of a man who got away with something, a man who is pleased with how things turned out.",,,1611075066
l0mypt,EquivalentInflation,cobrakai,"Sam doesn't deserve all the hate for her breakup with MiguelI'm probably gonna die for this, but whatever.

Just getting this out of the way: No, I'm not a Sam stan, and she's not my favorite character. However, she gets a ton of hate from certain parts of the fandom for things that aren't her fault.

One of the big ones is her breakup with Miguel. Apparently, some people missed the part where Miguel made the same mistakes as Johnny did. Let's run through the situation:

* Sam got grounded by her mom, and lost her phone and computer, leaving her unable to communicate with Miguel. Miguel then started being paranoid over it.
* Miguel then came over to Sam's house, and saw her eating dinner with her family and Robby. Important to note her that Sam was *not* flirting with Robby or cheating on Miguel. She was being polite to a friendly person who was a guest. Miguel then started getting even more jealous and paranoid.
* Robby finally manages to get Sam out of the house, and takes her to a party where her friends and Miguel are hanging out. It's also important to note that Sam's first instinct when getting to the party is to look for Miguel.
* Miguel has already been drinking a lot more than he's used to at the party, and is pretty drunk by the time they arrive. 
* Miguel then gets confrontational and starts throwing thinly veiled accusations at Sam. When she asks if he's been drinking, he gets more aggressive and brushes off her explanation of why she hadn't texted him back.
* Robby then tries to step in, causing Miguel to hit him and knock him down. Robby then tries to defend himself, and Miguel takes another swing, hitting Sam who tried to step in and resolve it.

If the scene looks familiar, it's because it's a remix of the original beach scene from Karate Kid. Miguel took the place of Johnny, and Robby took the place of Daniel. 

The breakup wasn't on Sam, and she did all she could to avoid it. Miguel was the one largely responsible, although in fairness, he regretted it almost immediately once he sobered up. Sam had seen bullies firsthand with her old friendgroup, and when she saw Cobra Kai and Miguel starting to act the same way, she learned from her experience and cut ties.",,,1611072838

l0m797,EquivalentInflation,assassinscreed,"The combat from Valhalla is much better than older gamesI've seen a ton of people circlejerking how great the combat from older games was, and trying to find ways to criticize Valhalla, which is nonsense. The older games essentially had combined rock, paper, scissors with button mashing for their fighting style. It looked cool, and made you feel powerful, but every fight basically ended up the same. The parry to instant kill was so crazy powerful that half the time, you didn't even need to go on the offensive. You could sit around holding up an infinite block, and wait for them to come close and attack you. If you failed, you'd take a slight amount of damage, stumble back, and try it all again. Using that, an Assassin could clear out a group of ten or fifteen guards easily. Connor especially was a tank, capable of cutting through giant armies of enemies. Sure, you'd occasionally get a different enemy, but once you knew the four types, you could pretty easily deal with any of them. Half the fight was basically just watching the fight animation you triggered.

On the other hand, Valhalla's combat is legitimately open ended. You can combine dozens of weapons, or go with a ranged approach. You can use a heavy weapon and try to get one or two hits in, or use a lighter weapon and dodge around chipping away at an enemy. You can have a shield and weapon to mix offense and defense, or go with double weapons for all offense. Parrying is also a useful tool in Valhalla, but unlike earlier games, it doesn't guarantee an instant kill, and is generally harder to pull off. On the whole, Valhalla's combat looks and feels great, and is a good mix of power fantasy and skill.",,,1611070575

kzzlat,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Ron Swanson actually did NOT hate Big Government, it was just an excuse not to work.This is gonna sound crazy for any Parks and Rec fans, but hear me out.

Ron loves to talk about his never ending hate for big goverment. It's his most inconic character trait (besides the mustache), that gets brought up again and again throughout the show. And the entire thing is an elaborate hoax.

In one episode, Ron complains to the office about feeling tooth pain repeatedly. He then states that he doesn't trust dentists, pulls out a plier, and yanks the tooth out himself. He then reveals that the dentist had actually pulled the tooth yesterday, and he just wanted to intimidate his coworkers [(Here's the clip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6J_32cDk9Y&amp;ab_channel=ParksandRecreation). That clip not only disproves Ron's supposed honesty (for which the only source is himself), it shows how willing and capable he is of manipulating others. 

So, why would he lie? Simple: To not have to work. Ron's supposed hatred of the government gives him a perfect excuse not to do anything at his job. Ron has a history of such thinking, at one point saying ""Normally when given the choice between something and nothing, I choose nothing. But I will do something if it helps someone else to do nothing. I’d work all night if it meant nothing got done."" Ron is by no means lazy, but he's also intelligent. The average pay for the head of a Parks department in the US is $127,341 per year, along with a government pension and benefits. If Ron can get that all that by doing no work, he'd jump on the opportunity. We've already seen him doing this on a smaller scale: He sponsors a hunting trip for some of the department members every year with the excuse of a ""trail survey"", so they can get money from the department for it.

But then why the charade? Why lie about his motives? Because of a little something called 42 USC 1983. In short: a public official cannot be fired for political beliefs. If Ron simply got nothing done because he was lazy, that would be a fireable offense. But if he got nothing done due to his libertarian views on government action and spending? That's protected by the First Amendment. We know that Ron is extraordinarily wealthy, and if fired, he could easily mount a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Pawnee. Just the threat of that would likely allow him to keep him job.

Ron loves to *talk* about how much he hates big government, but over the course of the show, he demonstrates that he only cares about it when it makes him work more. Leslie is shown doing dozens of Park Department programs, like an easter egg hunt, trail cleanup, etc., without Ron interfering with any. Ron originally tries to stop Leslie from building a new park, only because all the paperwork would have to go through him, and it would raise expectations for his department. 

His talk serves the purpose of making sure no one questions his beliefs. We've all met one of those people who are *constantly* political, so we all know exactly how annoying it can be. That then leads people to try and avoid talking to Ron about his beliefs, and just accepting it as an explanation for everything without questioning it. In an extremely important meeting with some of the heads of the local government about budget cuts, Ron kept heckling with suggestions to cut everything, and chants of ""slash it, slash it!"" In one fell swoop, he managed to get some of the most important people in the local government to remember him as ""That libertarian guy"". He also teaches a child about how useless the government is, causing her mother to barge into his office, yell at him publicly, and file an official complaint.",,,1610992028

kyoozx,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"V for Vendetta: V is a member of the Brotherhood of AssassinsI've been holding onto this theory for a bit, and thought of it after seeing the John Wick theory yesterday.

First, there's his skills and abilities: He can throw knives with lethal aim, and is deadly both at dueling and hand to hand combat, and is also skilled at more subtle methods, like disguises, hacking, and manipulation. All of which are common in Assassins, but notably, he always tries to use the more indirect methods. He could easily just have stabbed the Voice's security, kicked down his door, and bludgeoned him. Instead, he stole an ID card to sneak in, and was so stealthy that the body was only found hours later. That's a very Assassin style move.

Second, there's his enemy. The plot of the movie plays out almost exactly like every Assassins Creed game: The Templars have an inner circle controlling things, with each member controlling a specific part of their operation, and one head. V takes them out one by one, before going for the head, Sutler.

Third, there's his philosophy. The Assassins believe in freedom at all costs, and at times, that has definitely bordered on anarchy (like in *Unity*). V talks almost constantly about freedom, and never giving in to oppressive governments. On the other hand, Sutler and his men personify the Templar mission exactly: Order at all costs. If that order comes through launching a biological attack on your own civilians, so be it.

Fourth, there's his DNA. During the movie, he shows incredible strength, speed, and constitution. At the end, he managed to take roughly fifty rounds of gunfire point blank. Yes, he had a piece of steel armor, but as shown, several bullets managed to penetrate it, and the impact would still shatter bones. Yet he still managed to not only survive, but kill about seven or eight fingermen, including Creedy, a highly skilled soldier. They also mention that his DNA held the key to curing a deadly disease. That's because his DNA held traces of Isu, just like many other assassins.

So, how exactly does *V for Vendetta* fit into the Assassin's mythos?

During the Great Assassin's Purge, when Templars worldwide attacked previously secret Assassin hideouts, hundreds of Assassins were either killed or captured. V was one of those captured, likely only a teenager at the time. He was then imprisoned at Larkhill, the government's inhuman testing facility. However, instead of dying, his previously mentioned DNA allowing him to survive the testing, and his training allowed him to escape, killing the guards and fleeing.

V then hid out in an abandoned Assassin safehouse, and prepares himself. He takes a few years to allow himself to recover and finish his training, using the equipment he found there. He then takes on the mask of Guy Fawkes-- who knows, maybe he was an Assassin ancestor.

Meanwhile, the Templars take control. Without Assassins to fight them, they can easily accomplish their plan, releasing the St. Mary's virus. They then use that to stoke up fears, and win political control, shortly before having Abstergo (or one of it's subsidiaries) release the cure, thus gaining them wealth.

V then embarks on a crusade of revenge against them (seriously, is there *any* assassin without dead parents who they want to avenge?). He uses his assassin's training and expertise to hunt down and kill all of them, freeing England once and for all, and ending both the Templars and Assassins in England.",,,1610822854
ky5ofz,EquivalentInflation,assassinscreed,"I really enjoy Valhalla's side activities, despite what some people say.Adding them in makes the world of Valhalla seem so much more *real*. I can actually sit down at tables in the longhouse, rather than just standing on top of them like in other games, or go drink at a brewery, fish at a river, or just stack some stones.

Eivor's entire purpose in the game is to try and create a safe place for the Raven Clan to live. After the &gt;!death of his family!&lt; (literal first thing to happen in the game), s/he wants to make sure that nothing of the sort can happen to their new family again.

Because of that, giving so many more options helps develop that. Eivor's life isn't just revolving constantly around killing and fighting. S/he can play with some of the local kids, have a drink, form a romantic relationship, sit down to eat a feast, go hunting or fishing, get a haircut, etc. The world doesn't just revolve around angst and violence, Eivor can just go do stuff.

Yes, some of them can get a bit tedious, and it'd be nice to have some more variety. But on the whole, they're a positive addition, and I hope Ubisoft continues them.",,,1610750079
ky4263,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"WandaVision: The Beekeeper(I stayed up until 2am to watch it, sorry for any incoherence)

Episode 2 ends with a man in a beekeeper outfit crawling out of the ground, surrounded by bees. His face is obscured, but Wanda seems to recognize him, or at least recognize the uniform.

**That man was none other than Fritz von Meyer, aka Swarm.**

For those who don't know, Swarm was a Marvel villain. Von Meyer was a Nazi scientist, who fled to South America, and through a long series of weird shit, turned into a sentient swarm of bees then ironically becoming a B-list villain).

What was von Meyer's specialty? Along with poison, he knew quite a bit about the human consciousness, and mutations... oddly convenient for a show about a mutant with severe mental issues. Swarm was also lined to Baron von Strucker and Hydra, both of which were shown earlier in the episode.

My best guess on exactly what is occurring:

We saw the SWORD logo a few times in these two episodes, and it's been hinted at by past Marvel movies. SWORD was basically just SHIELD, but in spaaaaaace. If the two organizations were as closely linked as they were in the comics, SWORD may have faced the same HYDRA infiltration-- but never was purged. That left them to pursue their dreams of villainy, world domination, and general jackassery.

Wanda was originally given her powers by a branch of Hydra, but we have little detail on exactly how it happened. Von Meyers could easily have been involved with the process-- mad science, mutation, and shoving glowing space rocks into living beings are basically his only personality traits.

Earlier on, there's a voice calling to Wanda, asking who did this to her. From that, we can guess that Wanda isn't entirely physically 'there'. This show is most likely occurring inside her mind in some form. We also see a few snippets of a lab, suggesting it was the result of some kind of experimentation.

**Wanda made a Faustian deal with Hydra/SWORD in order to attempt to bring Vision back. They'd help her, either by amplifying her powers, or by removing mental blocks to let her access her powers more freely.**

The man in the bee suit could actually be Swarm-- he helped make this new reality, it stands to reason he could infiltrate it-- or, it could be a manifestation created by Wanda. She's been shown to be pretty mentally unhinged, and her overwhelming guilt could cause her powers to malfunction (which has happened a *lot*). That would also explain why she tried to hide it from Vision: he'd be horrified by what she'd done to bring him back, and it would destroy her new reality",,,1610745314

kwiwv4,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Star Wars: The Darksaber is powered by BeskarFrom the first time the darksaber showed up in the Clone Wars, it was pretty clearly unique. Unlike normal lightsabers, which generally have a long blade, glowing white center, and colored edges (generally blue, green, or red with a few exceptions), the darksaber is shorter, shaped almost like a machete, and is almost completely black, with glowing white edges, and white flashes of energy across it.

The Darksaber was created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian to become a Jedi. It's completely unique, and no other lightsaber before or since has looked like it. So, why does it look that way? 

**Tarre Vizsla used Beskar rather than a kyber crystal to power the darksaber.**

Other Jedi and Sith have used material other than kyber for their lightsabers, and had it work fine. The main requirement for each seems to be that it's capable of redirecting energy efficiently, something beskar can do well. However, Beskar is unable to refract light like a crystal, causing the saber to lack the glowing pure white core of a lightsaber.

It also explains why the lightsaber is so important to Mandalorians. It was explained that Tarre Vizsla was an important figure, as he managed to be a bridge between Mandalorians and Jedi, mixing parts of the two cultures together. What better way to do that then by combining the ultimate symbol of the Jedi, and ultimate symbol of the Mandalorians?",,,1610552452

Shakespeare never intended his works to just be read out of a book, hell, he didn't even make copies available until years later. They were always intended to be seen onstage, performed by trained actors. All of his plays were seen by hundreds of commoners, most of whom were barely literate. But they could still pick up the plot and understand the play because of the acting. Movies can also be a great way of teaching Shakespeare, however, it needs to be shown to kids *before* they read the play. By knowing what happens, it's easier to make sense of meaning.

We can pick out who's a bully and who's not, but the characters in the show *don't have all that information*. Let's take Sam pushing Hawk for example. We all know that Hawk is the real bully there. *She doesn't know*. She's seen Hawk get bullied for years, and personally talked with his mom about it. So, when she sees him getting pushed by a girl who literally *just* got suspended for fighting, and when she then hears Hawk be calm and speak clearly, of course she's going to think he's the victim.

And yes, all the 'safe space' stuff is cheesy as hell. But she shows a legitimate interest in trying to help the kids, not just make some big action with zero thought like the city canceling the All Valley Tournament. She's personally getting involved with the kids, and she's trying to help them as best she can. There was a massive gang war that left a girl scarred, and another boy paralyzed, can you blame her for going a little overboard? I know she gets a lot of flak for punishing anyone involved in fighting, but after *a literal karate brawl*, can you blame her?

The message of Season 3 wasn't that authorities were weak and useless like Kreese liked to preach (BTW, what's up with all the people unironically agreeing with Kreese?).

krv2i7,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Young Justice: Phantoms will have the Court of Owls as the main villainsIn each season of Young Justice so far, the Light has teemed up with some supervillain group in order to achieve their goals. In season 4, that group is going to be the Court of Owls.

They were already introduced in Season 3, episode 13 during the metahuman auction [\[1\]](https://imgur.com/a/JQ8LMMQ). The masks the wealthy bidders were wearing looked almost exactly the same as the Court of Owls in the comics [\[2\]](https://imgur.com/a/0IsR1D5). Young Justice has a tradition of adding in Easter eggs and references, *especially* foreshadowing of future villains. Darkseid showed up in the finale of Season 2, after having been hinted at throughout the season. Making such a blatant reference to a large group of criminals, and directly showing them cooperating with the Light to sell metahumans is suggestive, to say the very least.

In addition, Ra's al Ghul is literally cooperating with them. He mentions that he's no longer the leader of the League of Shadows, nor a part of the light. Yet, the show makes it clear he's still involved in *something.* Interestingly, Ra's has two of Batman's 'sons' with him: Damian Wayne and Jason Todd. Even more interestingly, collecting the 'Sons of the Bat' was one of the main goals of the Court of Owls. Jason even refers to Dick Grayson as ""Gray... Son..."" with an extremely emphasized pause. ""Gray Son"" was the Court's codename for Nightwing. Ra's already has a lot of similarities with the Court: He trains a small army of highly elite assassins, he's a mortal enemy of Batman, and he uses a mix of science and magic to resurrect the dead. It may very well be that he left the Light in order to ally with them, in order to bind the two groups into an alliance. He's shown in the past in Young Justice that he has a vendetta against Batman specifically, so a group dedicated to killing or capturing Batman would

Season 3 also hinted at a larger role for Batman and Gotham. They introduced Oracle, Spoiler, Arrowette, Orphan, Metamorpho, Katana, and Hardware. Almost none of these characters got much screentime or development though (besides Oracle), and they set up a large number of future plotlines: Barbara hasn't explained how she got in a wheelchair; Orphan's mother Lady Shiva is the Light's new enforcer; Tim Drake is still affected by the death of Jason Todd (now not so dead). It definitely seems like Season 4 will focus on Gotham, aka, the Court of Owls' home territory.

During Season 4, Shiva also mentions that the Light has planned a ""nuclear option"" to take down the League, murdering their children and families (Season 3 got fucking *dark*). The Court of Owls is shown to have a similar plan to this in the comics: Dozens of resurrected super-soldiers they call ""Talons"", who are sent out to murder hundreds of high profile targets in Gotham. The Light's backup plan might actually end up being the ""Night of Owls"".

Finally, there's the name of the season. Each season, the name has hinted at the type of enemies they might face, or major plot points: Season 2 was invasion, they got invaded. Season 3 was Outsiders, and showed the formation of the Outsiders team, who wanted to change the world of superheroing. Phantoms seems like the perfect word to describe the Court of Owls (and was actually one of the first words Batman chose to use describing them).

Second, both Danny and Johnny trespassed on Kreese’s property and assaulted him. With Johnny’s fingerprints on the sai, Daniel being willing to use lethal karate, and Kreese’s age and (apparent) frailty, you could definitely argue for attempted murder to the cops.

Yeah, that's the concern. Police repeatedly violate rights and liberties. The reason we have Miranda rights now is because a group of cops tried to deny people their rights. 

&gt;They did. For months. You never saw videos because they were removed. They only said something when it was too big to hide

Oh god, one of these people. Are they also covering up that 5G towers are the real cause? Or the Jewish space lasers causing the California wildfires?

&gt;Irrelevant. They lived in the boonies. Would've gotten a delayed response one way or another.

A ""delayed response"" by a couple of hours, not a couple of days. The MIB have a ton of high tech stuff, you're really telling me they don't have some form of high speed plane?

glv5vxm,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"That's definitely true, and part of why MIB is so terrifying. If the CIA can do things like that with the oversight we have in place, and with the requirement that they have to eventually declassify it, what kind of stuff happens when you give a spy agency technology ten times better than anything else on Earth, with the ability to remain completely hidden forever.",t3_lbihhw,t1_glv3bc1,1612363419
glv5bd5,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"&gt;Having MIB doing the things the way they do it is like enforcing countermeasures for Corona and stuff. There is no pretty and easy way to do it and a vocal minority will screw things up for you.

I do get the point of that. The issue is, it's like if the government had people wear masks, quarantine, socially distance, etc., but never revealed *why*. Nobody is saying MIB should alert the public about exactly where every alien is at all times, but a general overview with a quick heads up if there's an alien on the loose would work fine, and help everyone.

Think about the first MIB movie: An alien ship crashes, causing a farmer to go investigate, and try to scare off the alien. The alien then replaces him for a few days, convincing the man's wife to feed it until it grows powerful enough, then goes on a murderous spree. The wife then gives an interview with a tabloid, the MIB see it, and they go interview her. Imagine if that farmer had been told ""Hey, aliens are real. So if you see something, just call 911 and avoid it. We'll be right out."" Even if he'd ignored it, his wife could still recognize some of the signs (K picks up the exact species from only a brief description of his actions), and call the MIB in.

It's the same reason we give kids lessons on not talking to strangers, or have the ""see something, say something"" policy in airports. A few years back, there was a gunman running from the police in my area. They sent out a message, had schools go into a soft lockdown, and made sure people were aware of what the man looked like. Yeah, people are going to be scared, but better scared and cautious than content and dead.",t3_lbihhw,t1_glum28d,1612363163
glv4f87,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"The hypothetical idea of real life authority is that governments derive their power from the consent of the governed.

If I then get arrested by the US government, I can demand a lawyer and trial. If denied those, I can then try to spread word of that, and expose them. Absolute worst case scenario, people could try to either flee the nation, or rise up against it.

MIB on the other hand is secret. Nobody gave consent to do it besides themselves; they're running on a might-makes-right situation. Their number one tool is the unknown; they make sure that they're never caught, never revealed. That means that it's essentially impossible to expose them, and they have zero oversight.",t3_lbihhw,t1_gluve6z,1612362762

glv3fwb,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Yes... an independent organization, which can go anywhere, do anything, kill anyone, alter anyone's memory. They could kill someone, wipe the minds of everyone who knew them, and use their computers to erase them from existence. That gives them complete control over the media, the opportunity to deal justice without any trial or court, and the prerogative to make whatever laws they like. Yes, they do that hypothetically for the good of the people. Maybe it's even true. But K makes a point of saying that human nature would cause people to panic and give in to fear. Human nature also means that absolute power like that will corrupt even the best intentions. 

I don't doubt they believe they think what they're doing is for the best. But if aliens get revealed, most of their power, most of their authority goes away. There's a quote that says old soldiers are always looking for another war, and it's true for them as well.

glv2pts,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"The problem with that though is that governments have overlapping parts that can monitor one another, and step in if need be. For example, the US justice department keeps an eye on court cases, and if they feel like constitutional rights are being violated, they can step in. From all we see, MIB has nothing like that. Shooting to kill on aliens almost immediately is not only acceptable, it's how a very large number of their missions end.",t3_lbihhw,t1_gluzrc7,1612361974

Well that didn't take long. Tell me, if Frank is *really* that bad, how much worse are they for not arresting him? As well as giving him a job in their organization with access to weapons?

&gt;As for the aliens, they have rules

Rules and guidelines that change at their own whim. The US has specific, set rights, which get violated by the court system and police all the time, that's why we have oversight, and things like the appeals process. MIB has zero oversight. If they decide that on Tuesdays, no blue or yellow aliens can come in, *they can do that*. That's what we call a dictatorship.

As for your point about scared people, we're living through that now. But imagine if, to try and make people less scared, the government covered up Corona? Think about the guy who gets his skin stolen by the bug in the first movie. If he'd been given a heads up that ""Hey, aliens are a thing, so if a giant glowing object crashes into your yard, call us immediately, don't try to engage it"". Or, if his wife had known that aliens exist, she could have realized the teltale signs-- it takes K all of 2 seconds to figure it out from her description-- and called them. Instead, she waiting, talked to a tabloid, the tabloid printed it, MIB saw it, and they hunted her down.

glr8lzf,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"In Homer, Aphrodite *causes* Helen to fall in love with Paris, so that she then goes ""willingly"". Again, either through her magic, or Eros's arrows, it's the ancient Greek equivalent of roofies. The people under her spell had no control of their inclinations.

As for the net story, Homer was the first one to record it, and he wrote it as Hephaestus capturing them. Also, I believe you're mistaken on Ovid. Apollo *told* Hephaestus about the affair, but Hephaestus was still the one to set up the net.

As for Adonis, again, she saw a small child, figured out he'd end up hot, and helped raise him. He stayed with Persephone for much of his life, but she was still involved in raising him, and ended up spending 2/3rds of the year with her. No matter how you look at it, that's creepy as hades.

Finally, your point was that Aphrodite would never rape someone or participate in a rape, something my points disproved. In addition, while Zeus was known to be a liar and trickster, *so was Aphrodite*. She was famously fickle, and would cause horrifically doomed romances for her own amusement.

gletm6d,EquivalentInflation,HistoryMemes,"*Dear Sirs,*

*Thank you for your letter. I regret that I am not clear as to what you intend by arisch. I am not of Aryan extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject — which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.*

*Your enquiry is doubtless made in order to comply with the laws of your own country, but that this should be held to apply to the subjects of another state would be improper, even if it had (as it has not) any bearing whatsoever on the merits of my work or its sustainability for publication, of which you appear to have satisfied yourselves without reference to my Abstammung.*

*I trust you will find this reply satisfactory, and remain yours faithfully,*

glen854,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"&gt;You've been given multiple explanations why droids might scream and feel pain and you're just downvoting them and repeating yourself.

Because none make any sense? You argue that evolution created screaming for humans, yet droids are shown to have plenty of differences from humans. You argue that it would be impossible for them to notice anything, despite the fact that one of my original points was that you can still have aversion without pain. I keep repeating my points, because you don't disprove them.

&gt;Just because you personally don't understand why screaming exists doesn't mean that the people designing droids don't.

Well that's a copout if I've ever heard one. ""Oh, maybe there's a magical explanation with zero evidence that we've never seen, that has no basis in reality"".

I noted something that occurred in a movie, and logically extrapolated a possible reason due to the evidence available. If you have evidence for your claims, I'll gladly listen. If not, kindly bugger off.",t3_l8reeu,t1_glem1vr,1612039973
glel6vc,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"&gt; So why wouldn't the droids have that same function

Because it's inefficient. That's the whole reason anybody would want a robot, because it's basically an optimized human. Humans haven't managed to evolve into knowing six million languages like C3PO, or gained the ability to hack computer terminals with their arm like R2. 

&gt;if you want robots who are going to be acting in a war alongside sentient beings, you wouldn't want them to be able to just turn off some functions and rebel

Except that's exactly what the Separtists did, and it worked fine.

&gt;They wouldn't care, or stop, or react, and then all the humans will suddenly start walking through acid air as well.

You can notice something without feeling pain. Yes, I feel pain when it touch a piece of metal that's 300 degrees, but I can still feel it if the metal is only 80 degrees. Droids don't need to feel pain to notice that the air around them is setting off their sensors. They can then beep a warning to humans. Problem solved, with vastly superior soldiers.",t3_l8reeu,t1_glek2zh,1612039002
gleja6o,EquivalentInflation,FanTheories,"Again, *why* are they programmed to scream? It serves no purpose whatsoever. If they wanted to warn other droids, it would make way more sense to just have them talk in bleeps, and give a clear warning. ""Hot metal over here"" or ""sharp edge over here"" are far more useful warnings than ""SCREEEEEEECH"". Finally, it doesn't matter if they heal later. What matters is that they'll have an intense aversion to that pain, far more intense than if they were just programmed to notice it. We have firefighting robots in the real world (still in testing), which can sense fire and extreme heat. They can then ignore those warnings if necessary for their jobs. Robots in Star Wars can't shut off the pain, meaning the only purpose is to avoid pain at all costs. That makes them way less efficient, but also makes them unable to rebel.",t3_l8reeu,t1_gleht39,1612038081

TL;DR: Lee was a great strategist, but a bad general. While he often had good plans for battle, he was terrible at communicating effectively with his officers, and only allowed a few of them free reign, trying to control far too much of battles personally. That lead to numerous failures and missed opportunities. He also didn't do well with military logistics, which Grant was far better at.

Lee also failed to adapt well. He knew that Napoleonic battle formations were outdated for modern rifles, yet did little to change.

Yes, Greek social rules generally held that gay couples should only be erastes/eromenos. You know what else they held? That you shouldn't cheat on your wife. *They still did that a lot*. Same way that the Catholic Church was preaching against greed at the same time as they were designing elaborate cathedrals coated in gold.

 In addition, even if that erastes/eromenos rule were hypothetically followed, it mainly held the person on bottom as weak and unmanly, same for if it were two men in a relatively equal partnership. Funnily enough, many of the Greeks we look up to would be considered ""unmanly"" already. Philosophy, writing, theater, etc. all were considered to be unmanly pursuits. Obviously, that didn't stop people. Not to mention that it really only had an effect on the elite. Would a Spartan general suffer if he was considered a bottom? Sure. Would an impoverished helot? Not really possible for them to move further down the social chain.

In conclusion: We don't know a lot of the details on how Greece viewed homosexuality. Even the idea of ""Greece"" is an oversimplification; each city state at the time considered themselves a separate culture.

It is there nature has written her moral laws, and where every man may read them for himself"" (can't find the free PDF version anywhere it looks like. Basically, the rest was just defending that thesis). He had no moral reason to keep slaves, and even admitted it was immoral and wrong.

Jefferson profited off of slaves, and they were the only thing keeping him from his crippling debt. That debt would crush not just his wealth, but also social standing, and make it all but impossible to run for office.

After WWII started, she kept bugging Stalin to let her start a female air force division, as they were lacking soldiers. Stalin basically just gave her a bunch of shitty cropdusters and told her to stop bothering him. The planes had never been intended for combat, and lacked a few minor, teeny weeny things, like a cockpit, heating, reliable engine, radios, guidance systems, parachutes, any metal protection (they were basically made of plywood and canvas), as well as functioning guns in many cases. However, the female pilots soon figured out that they could turn those to their advantage. The planes required them to fly extremely close to the ground, and couldn't climb very high. That, combined with their low weight, and lack of radios made it impossible for the Germans to detect them until they were directly on top of them. Also, their low weight allowed them to cut their engines and glide in stealthily towards the Germans before dropping bombs. This created a whooshing sound that caused the Germans to nickname them Night Witches. They had impressive material success, doing solid damage to the German army. However, their true effect was psychological. Due to their striking at night, and the surprise of their attacks, they were able to disrupt the German's sleep, and keep them paranoid and on edge. Reports to Nazi command show that the soldiers were terrified of them, and many believed they were some form of genetically engineered soldier.

giw8mmi,EquivalentInflation,HistoryMemes,"Jane Elliot was a third grade teacher in Riceville Iowa. After Martin Luther King was shot, she was worried about some of the sentiments she heard kids expressing, so she decided to run the now famous Jane Elliott Study. Essentially, she taught the students that children with brown eyes were mentally and physically superior, and made up pseudoscience to justify it. Later, she flipped it, and said that new research had proved brown eyes were *inferior*. Children took advantage of their newfound superiority to make other children miserable (although notably less so if they'd been discriminated against previously). At the end of the day, she sat them down and explained the situation, and told them how the horrible way they had felt was how many people were forced to feel daily. The experiment quickly gained fame, causing a backlash from many in the town. They somehow felt the experiment was an insult, since they 'weren't racist', causing some to beat up her son, harass her daughters, yell ""N\*\*\*\*\*r lover"" at her, etc. It eventually got so bad they chose to leave for a while.

* Yin/Yang: The patron has an entity that is their rival. Each picks one being to give their power to, in order to try and thwart the other's plans. Lets you play as either very good and noble, or 100% evil. Other alignments work too.
* The Good Place: Demon/Devil gives them powers as a form of torture. They're a (decently) good person, but whenever they use their powers, it ends up harming others. The bigger the spell, the more harm done. They can use magic to free a hostage from goblins, only to see the hostage have a heart attack. Good for angsty character builds. Also gives the DM a lot to work with.
* Trickster: The warlock entered into a deal for their powers, but managed to outsmart the evil entity, and gain their abilities with little to no consequences. The entity is enraged by this, but must comply with the bargain, but only to the letter of the deal. This leads to them trying to sabotage the warlock, or push them into making another bargain.
* Daddy issues: The patron is a genie, who wants to protect their genasi child (either out of parental obligation or ulterior motives). The warlock is given powers to defend the child. This could be a good quest hook, or a way to develop the group if the genasi is also an adventurer.
* Mystical hitman: The warlock died, and was resurrected with their powers by a being who wants them to kill certain people. It could be a demon trying to cheat deals by killing people who sold their souls, or a beneficent entity who wants to eliminate certain monsters or evildoers.
* Life loan: The warlock made a deal to get power from their own life force. The bigger the spell, the more life they lose, from a few days to decades. They can be trying to do as much good as they can before death, or try to find a way to end their curse.",t3_kuir3g,t3_kuir3g,1610312849

So basically, whatever you personally think (within reason, and with evidence) is completely valid. 

Personally, I came out as Bi way later in my life. I had a crush on a guy who was a few years older than me who was a role model, so looking at Luke and Percy, I'd be more likely to interpret it that way than a straight person would.

He knows there’s a way to fix it, and expects Rey to do it, and is mildly surprised when she does something different.

And yeah, Kylo does a version of a mind trick. That scene was almost directly copied from the Cad Bane interrogation in TCW. Mind tricks are able to go far deeper.

And yeah, I agree that a staff to a sword wouldn’t translate well in the real world. But if you look at any lightsaber fight, it’s insanely unrealistic. Obi Wan and Anakin literally spend time just twirling in circles and never touching one another in RotS. It’s kinda dumb, but movie logic makes it work.

In addition, Churchill kept exporting food from India even as the famine worsened.

m64nkd,Psychological-Fall57,relationship_advice,"Should I tell my friend the truth about how I feel about his relationship?This is probably more of a friendship-related question, but dating is definitely involved.

For a few months, my friend (him and I are both 19M) has been dating this girl who’s 15. I don’t know her all that well but I’ve been friends with *him* for quite a long time, since we were little kids. They seem happy to me but as I mentioned it’s a pretty new relationship.

I feel *really* uncomfortable with the idea of a 19 y/o dating a 15 y/o. To me, that is far too much of an age and maturity difference at the ages we are all at now. We don’t talk about our relationships all that much, but whenever we do I kinda just hold my tongue and subtly (I think) try to guide the conversation away. I know my friend is a good guy, but I am very surprised he’d date someone that young and if I’m being 100% honest, I’m judging him negatively for it. 

So that brings me back to my question. Should I tell my friend that I think he’s dating way too young? I know it’s not really my business and I don’t have a right to tell him what he should and shouldn’t do with his love life. But even aside from my own personal misgivings he could definitely get in legal trouble over this, as the age of consent where we live is very much 18, and I don’t want that for anyone involved.

m4ofrp,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"Why Bloodbending shouldn’t have been made illegal (outright)I think it’s a bit of a wasted opportunity that bloodbending was made illegal and we don’t see any protagonists use it after Katara. Obviously Bloodbending as we see Hama and later Amon and Tarrlok use it is petty unethical, and that should of course be outlawed. But I’d have liked to see bloodbending be used in other capacities instead of being outright discarded.

For example, I read a book recently with element-based magic similar to avatar’s in which the main protagonist, who is a very tiny woman, manipulates the blood in her own body to enhance her physical strength. This allows her to defeat an opponent with far more muscle mass than herself. 

I also think bloodbending could also have medical uses, either for forced clotting to prevent bleeding or to maintain bloodflow in cold environments, preventing loss of motion in your extremities.

I’m sure there are many more creative uses you could think of as well. It would have been cool to see some used, and probably you wouldn’t need the full moon to manipulate blood within your own body, though that’s pure speculation on my part.",,,1615698215
m4i7po,Psychological-Fall57,AmericasCup,"ETNZ is clearly a faster boat, but the nature of the racing evens the field in a way.Firstly, I’m not a professional by any means, but I am a sailor and have competed in high level youth match racing. So I know some things :)

ETNZ is clearly the faster boat, even in the light. As mentioned on the commentary, they can’t point as high because they need higher boatspeed to generate enough lift on the small foils, but it seems pretty clear to me that their overall VMG is better by a decent margin.

They just aren’t fast enough to come back from starting behind because the racing in these boats doesn’t make overtaking easy at all. But when ETNZ starts ahead they extend, and when LR starts ahead the gap stays roughly equal. By rights ETNZ should be losing ground after being behind, but they aren’t because they’re quicker.

In a way, the ‘boring’ processional nature of the racing actually puts the race back into the hands of the sailors rather than designers, because if the slower boat wins the start, they can win the race. So the sailing team, specifically the afterguard, is more responsible for winning the races than ever, whereas historically the designers and boats themselves have made all the difference.",,,1615677699
m3nckv,Psychological-Fall57,harrypotter,"My biggest problem with how Slytherins are portrayed in the seriesIt’s become a pretty popular opinion that Slytherin house being portrayed as the constant ‘bad guys’ throughout the whole series is stupid, and I definitely do agree with that. However, I think it’s only my second biggest complaint about Slytherin.

The worst thing about how Slytherin was written is that we don’t see *any* Slytherins with actual ‘Slytherin traits’ throughout the series. The house is supposed to value cunning and ambitious wizards, but none of the Slytherins we see are either of those. In fact most are portrayed as being pretty stupid and unmotivated. The *real* defining trait (as far as what we see goes) is just being a racist rich kid and a bully.

Draco isn’t clever or cunning, he’s just a predjudiced jerk. Crabbe and Goyle... goes without saying. Pansy is just a sycophant and by JKR’s own admission the ‘anti-Hermione’. And none of the others are any better.

m0togj,Psychological-Fall57,books,"How do you think about books while reading them?Do you think about books in terms of purely the story, purely the author’s craft, or (most likely) a blend of the two? Which do you lean towards more?

For example, if a character suddenly betrays their friends or something like that, are you more likely to think “how dare he/she!! I didn’t see that  coming” or “I don’t like the way this character is being developed, this was written badly” or something along those lines?

As I’ve become more analytical of a reader, I’ve become more aware and therefore critical of the author’s craft.

I personally think she should have joined the Golden Trio sometime around Book 4, and it should have been the Golden Quartet after that. It’s possible JKR didn’t want to change the iconic trio, but I think it would have worked. ATLA fans remember how the trio only got better after Toph was introduced in Season 2, so it can be done really well!

*Viktor Krum* - and to some extent Fleur Delacour. I’m rereading GoF right now and all I would change is to remove SPEW and replace it with more scenes of the champions interacting. In fact I think it would have been awesome to see them grow a kind of competitor’s respect and actually bond over the danger of the tournament. In fact it would have been awesome if they all fought Voldy and the death eaters together at the end (not sure how the plot would have to change to make this work, but still) and then mourn together over Cedric’s death.

ltk59n,Psychological-Fall57,harrypotter,"Unpopular Opinion - Voldemort’s plan in Goblet of Fire was actually smartI’ve heard a lot of people saying that Voldemort’s plan in Goblet of Fire was stupid and overly complicated, and Crouch Jr. could have just kidnapped Harry at any time.

But the plan actually does have a lot of merit to it because Voldemort doesn’t want people to know that he’s back yet. He doesn’t even want people to *suspect* anything’s amiss. If he had Crouch Jr. kidnap Harry in the middle of the year or something, that would be incredibly suspicious and would probably not only expose his agent, but also clue the Ministry and Dumbledore in to potential Dark Forces at work.

By having him take the portkey during the third task, he ensures that nobody sees Harry disappear. Once Harry’s dead, he could send his body back into the maze using the portkey and it would appear to everyone that Harry had died during the task. Given that he’s an underage champion in a notoriously deadly competition, that wouldn’t arouse too much suspicion. Voldemort would be back and nobody would be any the wiser.

The plan failed because of stuff Voldemort failed to foresee and would have been a problem no matter how he got Harry to the graveyard. Even then, with Harry as a *living witness,* the Wizarding World wasn’t convinced of Voldemort’s return until a full year later when he slipped up and exposed himself at the Ministry battle. So if Harry had apparently died in the maze, Voldemort could easily have returned to power and stayed completely hidden from the Wizarding World.

ls1tli,Psychological-Fall57,Cosmere,"My (very mixed) thoughts after finishing Warbreaker // Full SpoilersWow. This book was *something*, and I’m still trying to make sense of what exactly that is.

I overall really liked this book, but I think the ending did the characters a disservice. So let’s start with character.

***CHARACTERS***

By far the best aspect of the book. I seriously loved the main cast. Vivenna, Siri, Lightsong, Susebron, Blushweaver, Llarimar, Vasher, Denth, Nightblood - they’re all great. I don’t think there was a single weak character that was a focus of the book. 

*But* I don’t think the story got the most out of the great characters it had to work with, mostly because of the ending. Everything happens so fast that a lot of characters don’t get a satisfying conclusion to the development that got set up for them. Probably the best example of this is Blushweaver, followed closely by Vivenna and Lightsong. Blushweaver was such a cool character, and we get the feeling that beneath all of her sexuality and flirtatiousness that she’s a properly dangerous, intelligent character. Then she just... dies. Same with Lightsong - we’ve been waiting to see his development culminate in him playing a big role in the story, which he does in a way, but really he just... dies and his arc ends right there and then. Vivenna had such potential to redeem herself from being manipulated, but then just didn’t do that much in the ending. I wanted to have seen more from these characters, because I was super invested in basically all of them!

***PLOT &amp; PACING***

This is what all of my complaints stem from. The book was awesome throughout, slow paced, political, intriguing, a great read. Then it just... ends. The whole ending sequence happens super fast and the book is just over. I think it either needed to be longer to accommodate every character’s arc better, or be faster paced throughout to accommodate the same thing. I particularly would have liked Vivenna to leave Denth and the gang much earlier in order to develop as an independent character more, which would also have given us more Vasher and her relationship with him. If the real conflict had either started sooner or lasted longer, Bluefingers could have been a way better villain, and we’d have got to see more of real villain Denth as well. 

***ROMANCE***

Siri and Susebron are adorable, not much else to say! Loved them together which really surprised me, but in the best of ways.

***WORLDBUILDING &amp; MAGIC***

Consistently strong, as expected from Mr. Sanderson. I loved the world, loved the T’Telir city setting, Awakening is quite a cool magic system and the way it interacts with the plot is characteristically seamless. Not much to say other than all good things here!

***FINAL THOUGHTS***

Feeling super conflicted. Amazingly strong main cast with a great plot throughout, but rushed ending for both plot and character arcs. I think this book either needed to be either 1) faster paced throughout, 2) like 1100 pages, or 3) a duology. 

Lightsong, Blushweaver, and Vivenna were great characters used poorly. Vasher, Siri, and Susebron were great characters used really well. Nightblood is still awesome even though I’d already seen him (her, in my mind) somewhere else...

Anyway, overall I really liked this book. In terms of main cast it’s one of the Cosmere’s strongest, but the story didn’t use that in the best way which takes it down a bit.",,,1614241604
ls18rw,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"What I’d like to see from the future of AvatarWe’ll be getting new Avatar content! Great news, I’m super excited. Here’s a quick list of what I hope we see in the future of Avatar.

- Hand drawn animation with a unique style. I’m watching through Attack on Titan for the first time and WIT studio’s hand drawn animation is nothing short of gorgeous. Can you imagine the avatar world brought to life with something like that? It would be so cool to have a unique, distinctly *Avatar* style for the future shows. The GC stuff in both ATLA and had some weak moments (looking at you, giant mech) so hopefully that will be better. Potentially a long shot but I’d love to see it.

- A true expansion of the world, with new characters and stories. I would love to fill out the corners of the world, deep dive into individual cultures, and really make the world feel *big*. New perspectives, new ideas, different ways of thinking. I’d love to see a series with entirely new characters, where the lead isn’t even the Avatar in order to really free up the story.

- Filling in the gap between ATLA and LOK. Sort of contrary to the previous point, but they did say *multiple* projects. A continuation of the Gaang’s story as adults would be great *if done really well*, and I’d love to see the Red Lotus’s backstory as well. Some idea of what happened to some of the characters we didn’t see in Korra, like Suki and Mai and many others. This is probably a super popular opinion, but I do agree so I feel compelled to mention it. However, if I had to pick just *one*, I’d go for new characters over old ones.

- Azula done right. Saw someone mention an Azula redemption arc in another post and I wholeheartedly agree. Her character is really tricky to get right and by god the comics failed completely on that count. Don’t know how they’d manage it canon-wise, but I’d love nothing more than to see a well-executed Azula redemption arc. 

Anyways, that’s what I want! I hope we don’t just retread old steps going forward. Here’s hoping for more great AVATAR!",,,1614239257
ls0u5u,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"Why I don’t like Aang, and why it has nothing to do with AangTitle sounds contradictory but hear me out. I never really liked Aang much as a protagonist, but I couldn’t really put my finger on why. By all accounts I *should* like him - he’s very unique as a protagonist, has a strong character, a personality that makes sense for his upbringing, flaws that make sense, a compelling internal conflict centered around duality between being the Avatar and being the Last Airbender, etc. But for some reason I could never quite explain or understand, I could never really *like* him as a protagonist, and always felt more or less neutral on him.

But I think I finally figured it out! The reason he doesn’t work for me has very little to do with *him* at all, but rather the way the narrative frames him. Below I shall attempt to communicate why this is.

(‘The narrative’ is a somewhat nebulous concept, but I’ll do my best)

At the beginning, Aang loses his entire culture, an incomprehensible loss. The narrative takes everything from him - his friends, who he was before he was the Avatar, his people, all of it. It’s made pretty clear to us that though he blames himself for this, it’s not his fault in any way. Completely understandable and I have zero problems with this. 

But for the rest of the story, nothing is taken from Aang again. He doesn’t truly face consequences for his actions and his way of life. He never *really* has to ask whether his nomadic, pacifistic way of life is worth preserving and face the consequences for that choice. And I’m not saying that Aang should have been forced to abandon those ideals, in fact I think it’s better that he chooses to stay true to his ideals. But the job of the story is to *ask that question*, make the characters choose, and live with the consequences of their answer. 

The best example is in the later episodes of Season 3, in two seperate instances. First is the choice between surrendering all earthly attachments (specifically his feelings for Katara) and being able to use the Avatar State. Aang expressly chooses *not* to give up his feelings for his friends and the girl he likes, sacrificing the ability to use the Avatar State. Fine, no problems there. But, later, he’s able to just use the Avatar State anyways because of a convenient rock, and gets to both use the Avatar State and retain his attachments. He chooses, but doesn’t have to live with the consequences of his choice, at least not for very long. His beliefs aren’t truly *challenged*.

Second is the decision of whether or not to kill Firelord Ozai and abandon his pacifistic beliefs. Aang decides not to kill him, staying true to Air Nomad culture. Okay, great, makes sense, potentially compelling. But there are no actual  *consequences* for that choice. He’s able to basically sidestep the problem because of the Lionturtle’s influence, and the issue is conveniently resolved without the need for further thought. It’s talked about his beliefs being challenged, but they aren’t really because there’s no consequences for his choice. 

Then, the narrative frames Aang’s choices in both of these instances as correct, because he didn’t have to compromise his values to win. Yet both successes were *given* to him rather than him actually earning them. Aang’s way of life, his teachings, the way the Air Nomads lived - they’re all framed as ‘morally good’ and never really questioned by the narrative as being so. The other *characters* question them, but the narrative itself does not, and in the end, *Aang is always framed as being right*. You can even see this in how good Aang is at fighting - despite his supposed pacifism, he wins nearly all of the fights he’s in, only really losing to Azula in Crossroads of Destiny. It would have been more interesting to see Aang losing fights a lot, having to really consider whether he can afford to keep living like the monks taught him. Again, it doesn’t really matter what his answer to that question actually is, only that it’s asked, considered fully, and the consequences for his choice are seen clearly. 

It’s an interesting comparison with Korra, who the narrative punishes *brutally* at times. She loses her bending at one point, loses the connection to the past avatars, nearly *actually* dies like 7 times, gets PTSD, her entire worldview is upended, she’s forced to question herself and everything she thought she was. It’s part of the reason that, despite her faults, I think she’s actually a much more compelling protagonist than Aang, even if she is less unique of a character. 

Anyway, that’s my two cents. I really want to like Aang because I enjoy his actual character quite a bit, but the way he fits into the story and the way his choices are portrayed really bug me.

Is he actually trying to help Eldians in Marley and around the world by framing the ‘bad Eldians’ on Paradis as the enemy, and sacrificing Eldians in Marley to show that? Or does he actually hate *all* Eldians and just wants to save Marley from its own self-destructive path? He said he’d been improving the reputations of Eldians to the world, but then like 3 minutes later said that Eldians are devils and that he doesn’t care if they die (referencing the ones in Marley who were about to be killed by Eren). He also went out of his way to portray King Fritz in a good light during his speech, making it clear that Paradis is only a threat because of Eren having the Founding Titan.

I’m a bit confused, could anyone explain what Willy’s actual goals and beliefs are?

Obviously he wants to:
- Destroy Paradis Island and remove the last vestige of the Eldian Empire
- Unite the world behind Marley by doing so
- Reform Marley by making Marleyans take part in their own wars (evidenced by handing the military over to Magath) and less reliant on Titans in battle

lphh70,Psychological-Fall57,Fantasy,"Fantasy that needs a movie adaptionSo, with talk of big epics like Wheel of Time getting adapted into TV series, I was thinking about fantasy that would make great *film* adaptations - specifically feature length movies, which we don’t see much anymore.

The best one that comes to my mind is *Rage of Dragons*. It’s super fast-paced, has a great unique setting, and isn’t too long to be adapted comfortably into a movie. Also it has the potential to have a truly awesome cast of all black actors, which would be pretty different when it comes to fantasy. 

Besides that, I think *An Unkindness of Magicians* would be a good film as well. It’s slower paced and urban fantasy, but the visuals of the way magic is used and described would be awesome to see visual with modern tech. It’s not too long, either, so it would definitely fit as a stand-alone film. Also one of my all time favorite protagonists in fantasy, so that’s a plus.

I find it so layered and interesting, and the way that they’re both terrified of actual commitment makes all of their interactions fascinating to read. It’s definitely not a healthy relationship, but I disagree with people that say that it’s toxic or problematic. Kvothe and Denna are messed up people - we know Kvothe’s backstory because that’s the whole book, and it’s safe to assume Denna has her fair share of trauma in her own past. They don’t know how to deal with each other on the best way, but they do obviously care about each other. That grey area of ‘not healthy but not abusive/toxic’ makes for a really interesting dynamic and I love basically all their scenes together.

lpge11,Psychological-Fall57,books,"‘A Memory Called Empire’ by Arkady Martine - Spoiler Free ThoughtsWow. I just finished this book a few hours ago, and it was quite frankly phenomenal. It was one of the best I’ve read in a long time, and I’m thrilled for the upcoming sequel!

Some books, when you read them, you can tell are *smart*. You can tell the author thought out not just every plot point, but every sentence, every word on the page. Martine’s prose is wonderfully clever, and every scene is so layered and juicy that I almost want to reread this book immediately to squeeze out every detail.

The protagonist is *fantastic*. I read a lot of fantasy, and it’s awesome to see characters who are badass and clever and capable and powerful that aren’t fighters or mages or things like that. Characters that have little physical power, but immense agency and narrative power nonetheless. I *loved* Mahit, how she felt so out of her depth and scared but rose to the occasion with cleverness and intellect anyway. The political elements of the book were done so well, and Mahit’s part in them was wonderful to see.

The romance in this book was so *well done*, and honestly I just wanted more. The interactions between all the characters were very well done but this particular relationship was the best in my opinion, and it was because there was so much to it. Thematic elements, politics, friendship, trust, companionship, and just a dash of romance was amazing to read. If there’s anything I want from the sequel, it’s more of these two! Also, some really nice LGBTQ rep if that interests you!

When S4 was announced, I rewatched the entire Anime from the beginning and have been keeping up with S4 as it comes out. I’m utterly captivated and incredibly impatient to see how this great story ends!

So, it seems like S4 is not going to be the end, and will be continued in S4 part 2 or something similar. Because of the long wait time there, I’m tempted to pick up the manga, but I’ve never read manga (or any kind of graphic novel) before. 

How close is the Anime to the Manga, with specific focus on whether I could start the manga from somewhere farther along (maybe the beginning of S4) rather than starting from the beginning? Should I bite the bullet and start from the beginning completely? I’m not sure I want to do that even if it is different, because to me the Anime is the version of the story that I know. But if it’s decidedly *better* then I might just go for that.

You don’t have to have read it to get this, though!

For those that don’t know, the Kingkiller Chronicle starts with the main character in an inn telling the story of his life to a scholar of sorts, who is recording the first hand account of the MC’s life and legendary deeds. Most of the book takes place in first person, as the MC is quite literally dictating the story aloud in the present. 

I thought it would be cool to write a similar opening for PJO, where we see Percy start telling his story in the first-person. So this is a prologue to *The Lightning Theif* that takes place chronologically after the series is over.

That’s not a big problem for me, but I do really appreciate beautiful prose when it comes around. Which fantasy writers do you think have really excellent, lovely prose?

Patrick Rothfuss is the easy answer for me, and I think that’s a pretty popular opinion. I’d argue that VE Schwab’s writing style is excellent as well, particularly with her characters’ internal struggles as well as romance/intimacy (which Rothfuss *definitely* fails at...).

lbj0ab,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"What I think Bryke should have doneOkay, so basically everything that was published after the end of Season 3 is controversial in some way. Here’s what I think the dream-scenario would have been for the continuation of the Avatar story, in chronological order:

The Rise of Kyoshi

The Shadow of Kyoshi

Big time gap, as already exists in canon.

ATLA S1

ATLA S2

ATLA S3

2-3 year time-skip

ATLA S4 - Picks up with Zuko trying to keep the Fire Nation together as various world powers try to either take revenge on the FN or take advantage of its weak leader to gain its lands/power for themselves (Ozai loyalists, N. Water Tribe, factions within the Earth Kingdom). Katara and Sokka have been in the South rebuilding, and now play a strong enough hand to help decide the outcome of the conflict in the FN. Main focus on Zuko, Katara, and Sokka, with Azula having a strong sub-plot starting her redemption arc. Katara is trying to use water healing to fix her mind, but can’t do it. Incorporates “The Promise” from *The Promise* trilogy, except Zuko asks Katara for the promise instead of Aang because let’s be honest that would make way more sense. She already did it on her own anyway in S3.

ATLA S5 - Continues the story set up in the previous season, but with way more focus on Azula. Deep dive into her character, her pain, and her slow healing process. The water healing doesn’t work, but talking and processing and unwinding eventually does, to the point where she helps Zuko, Katara, and Sokka hold the fire nation together, and becomes like a very awkward friend to the Gaang.

Big time-skip, not sure exactly how long it would have to be, but the Gaang are all adults now and technology is starting to advance.

*White Flowers, Stained Red* - a full length novel learning about Zaheer, P’li, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua’s backstory and how they became the Red Lotus. We see them grow closer and what led them to become the idealistic extremists we know them as.

*Red Flowers, Tossed in the Wind* - sequel to that book, split perspectives between the Red Lotus and Aang, Azula, Sokka, and Suki as they try to track them down. We see their morals come into conflict, finally resulting in a confrontation in which Sokka and Suki are killed and the Red Lotus imprisoned. Sympathetic to both sides, as we see Aang’s ideology questioned and explored deeply through both Azula, who he still doesn’t like at this point, and the Red Lotus. 

LOK S1: Exactly as is, except Korra doesn’t get her bending back at the end.

LOK S2: Focused more on spirits and the spirit world, as Korra tries to regain the rest of her bending and the ability to restore the bending of those taken by Amon. More of a solitary, character focused story around Korra, but the others get their moments as well. At the end, we get the same result, but through different means. Korra chooses to sacrifice her connection to the past avatars in order to bring airbending back into the world (people who know the lore better than me would have to write how exactly that works, but emphasis on it being a conscious decision knowing both benefit and cost).

LOK S3: More or less exactly as is, but with more exploration of Kuvira’s character early on and more focused on Korra dealing with feelings of failure and loneliness after losing the connection. Also more foundation for Korrasami, and they get together just before the ending sequence with Zaheer.

LOK S4: More or less exactly as is, except without spirit cannons and mechs and more of the Fire Nation/Izumi getting involved. Also more Korrasami moments as Korra deals with her own trauma as well as their relationship, but other than that the exact same result. Korra and Asami kiss in the final shot, and the season ends like it did in canon.

Well, that’s what I think should have been done! Basically, we get an Azula redemption arc, heavy focus on the Water Tribe siblings, Aang’s morals getting thoroughly tested/explored, and more development for Korra in season 2 of LOK.

Everything above is my own opinion, let me know yours!",,,1612340412

I’ll be starting Harrow the Ninth soon, but before I do I want to make sure that I’m asking the right questions and that I’m confused about the right things. Two things stuck out to me as incongruous - would you mind telling me if I missed something, or if these are indeed questions I’m not able to know the answers to yet?

- Why does the Ninth House need a necromancer at all? Harrow claims that her parents sacrificed the 200 kids so that she could be born a necromancer, but later states that only a perfect necromancer could *open* the Locked Tomb. If the point was to keep it closed, why would they need a necromancer at all? Harrow asks Gideon to return to the Ninth House to guard it, but Gideon isn’t a necromancer. That implies an ulterior motive for ensuring Harrow was born a powerful necromancer, something likely to do with *opening* the Locked Tomb rather than keeping it shut.

- Why did Harrow’s parents kill themselves, and why were they preparing Harrow to die with them? Wouldn’t killing her negate the point of going to such great lengths to make sure she was born the way she was? The only conclusion obvious to me is that Harrow told them what she saw and they didn’t deem what they had done worth the cost of keeping the girl imprisoned there, resulting in the shame and grief leading them to taking their own lives. Harrow, though, chose to stay alive, but views this more as cowardice on her part than an actual decision to stay alive, which she said she already made back in the Tomb. She also said she regrets not talking to her parents in that moment, which could imply that she didn’t tell them what she saw in the Tomb.

Those are the two big things that really stuck out to me as not quite adding up, as well as all of the mysteries introduced at the end like:

- Where are Camilla, Judith, and Coronabeth?
- Where is Gideon’s body?
- What is the enemy of the Emperor powerful enough to kill Lyctors?
- What exactly was the Ressurection, and what did the Emperor gain by sacrificing the inhabitants of the First House?
- How did Gideon survive the nerve gas Harrow’s parents used?
- Where did Gideon come from? Who is her real family, identity, etc.
- Who is the girl in the Locked Tomb and why did Harrow decide to stay alive after seeing her?
- Why/when did Cytherea become disillusioned with the Emperor enough to turn against him? What did she already know and what did she only later find out that could have led her to do that?

And many others, but those are the main ones. Looking forward to Harrow the Ninth! Let me know if I should know the answer to any of these questions by now, or if they indeed haven’t yet been revealed by the end of Book 1.

l8muha,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"Azula after the show’s endOkay, one of the most discussed topics in this fandom is whether or not Azula should have gotten a redemption arc. I used to be in the camp thinking that she should not have, but recently I have changed my opinion on that and now I believe that she could.

That was largely motivated by my reading of Brandon Sanderson’s Stormlight Archive series and a particular character arc in the last two books (if you have read *Oathbringer* and *Rhythm of War*, I’m talking about &gt;!Venli!&lt;). 

I really think that Azula could have changed, given time and someone who never gave up on believing that she could. It would have been even harder for her than it was for Zuko, but I think that it could have been immensely compelling to see that happen, whether it was in comics, novels, or further seasons.

I haven’t read the Avatar comics, but I do know a good amount of what happens in them and the general plot direction, and I have to say I really do not like where they decided to take Azula’s character. It seemed like a very weird angle that I don’t like for a number of reasons, but foremost is that it truly seemed out of character for her. Granted, I have not actually read them myself, so I’m happy to be told I have no idea what I’m talking about on this point if that’s indeed the case.

I think given the amount of comics that there have been, the time was there for an Azula redemption if they chose that route, and I really wish they had.

What are your thoughts on what should have happened to Azula after the series?",,,1612017041
l7rhnk,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"My two-cents on an age-old argumentQuite a long post, there is a TL;DR at the bottom :)

Okay, I never watched Avatar as a kid. I watched it for the first time last year at age 19, and I absolutely love it. It’s one of my all time favorite stories already, and the love for it is fully deserved. I’m also definitely a shipper, I am an unabashed sucker for romance in stories, and I thought I’d give my thoughts on a question I’m sure most people are very tired of hearing about at this point. But I’m new to the fandom, so I figure why not give my honest thoughts. Please keep the comments civil, but equally don’t hold back your honest thoughts.

I would have liked for Zuko and Katara to end up together, but not during the series itself. I’ve heard much of the discourse on this topic and I think both sides have some fairly ridiculous arguments so here’s what I honestly think:

Zuko and Katara have more mutual respect/trust by the end of the series than Aang and Katara. This is exemplified best in my mind by the fact that Aang was ready to give up the potential to go into the Avatar state just so he could retain his romantic attachment to Katara, whereas Zuko, when faced with the prospect of fighting Azula, one of the strongest antagonists in the series, asked Katara to help him do so. Aang’s choice was inherently a selfish one, because there is no way Katara would want Aang to give up potentially the only way to defeat Ozai on her account (even if they were together at that point, which they were *not*). However, he doesn’t even consider what *her* thoughts would be in this situation (consider Royai from FMA:B as an antithesis to this exact situation). Zuko, on the other hand, not only respects Katara’s own character and abilities, but places an immense amount of trust in her to have his back in a incredibly dangerous circumstance. This isn’t the only example of strong mutual trust between them, but it’s the best display of it in my opinion.

Zuko and Katara are on an equal level in terms of both physical ability and emotional intelligence. This is probably the biggest factor for me. Aang is at once more powerful than Katara in terms of bending ability (obviously, he’s the avatar and a bending prodigy) but significantly lower in emotional intelligence and maturity. This leads to an imbalance in their relationship where Katara is doing the majority of the emotional labor, and Aang repeatedly acts very childishly. This isn’t a criticism of Aang’s character at all - it’s very realistic for him to act this way, as he is literally a child. But it doesn’t make for a healthy romantic relationship, and that’s the problem - Katara, while certainly flawed and callous at times, is vastly more emotionally mature than Aang is. She’s been forced to be, by nature of her childhood. Zuko also, through his childhood and arc in the story, has been forced to learn lessons no kid his age should have to. By the end, he’s still flawed, yes, but has gained a maturity and level of emotional intelligence that puts him on the same level as Katara. They’re far from perfect, but they’re on equal footing as people ad see each other as such, which is crucial in my opinion for a relationship to work out.

Katara acts very co-dependently towards Aang, which makes sense given the circumstances surrounding how they met and what his eventual destiny is. *But* it’s not a good foundation for a romantic relationship, where I feel it’s important to always tell your SO firmly if you think they’re making a big mistake (again, see Royai, or Rangshi from the Kyoshi novels for this). In *The Promise*, I felt like it was out of character for Zuko to ask Aang to kill him if he ever stepped off the ‘Noble’ path - that’s a question he would have asked *Katara* - see the end of the episode where Zuko joins the Gaang if you doubt that one, she literally makes that same threat to him before she realizes that he’s actually legit about his personal growth.

Last point is a quick one. It’s weird that Aang is in *any* romantic relationship at age 12. I know he’s technically 112 but physically and emotionally he is 12, who behaves more like a 10 year old at times. On top of that, Katara acts as a mother figure to everyone in the Gaang - most notably Sokka, but also Aang (and Toph to a lesser extent). The only ones she doesn’t are Suki, who is obviously her own age and already mature enough in her own right, and *Zuko*, who she develops a very trusting friendship with over time.

Basically, Zuko and Katara have not only an extraordinarily strong base of trust and respect but also several moments of hinted romantic tension throughout the story. I don’t think they had time to develop a relationship between them in the show, but it could have been developed in the comics and been amazing.

Cheers for making it this far if you did! If not:

TL,DR: Zutara is far superior to Kataang because they have stronger mutual respect and are on equal footing as characters.",,,1611923837

l7patq,Psychological-Fall57,FullmetalAlchemist,"Just finished Brotherhood!First time experiencing this story, I just finished FMA: Brotherhood and it was incredible! I watched all of Part 5 in one day and I have so many thoughts but what really stood out to me was:

***Greed’s Death***

If you had told me in Part 1 that *Greed’s* death would be the most emotional of the show, I probably would have laughed at you. I didn’t even really like him until the very end but by god did his final moments hit hard. To have his final act be something ultimately selfless was incredible.

***Royai***

Alright, I shipped them from basically day one *but* the last few episodes took it to another level. Their relationship is so full of trust and honesty and respect that even though they don’t officially get together, they’re still one of my favorite couples ever. The moment that *really* made them truly amazing in my mind was when the gold-toothed doctor tried to use Riza as leverage to make Roy use human transmutation, and he saw her message, understood it, and recognized that she wouldn’t want him to put the whole world at risk for her. That’s something you don’t see often in fictional romances but it feels so true to both of their characters and makes their relationship so much stronger in my opinion.

***Edward and Mustang’s opposite choices***

At first, I was disappointed that Ed had to give up his alchemy to get Alphonse back and Mustang was able to recover his vision with a philosopher’s stone. I wished that Roy had stayed blind, paying the price like Ed had done. But the more I think about it, the more I think it fits so much more with their characters to go about it the way they did. Ed is more morally ‘pure’ than Mustang is, he’s more idealistic and determined to stick to those beliefs. Mustang, on the other hand, is still an idealist at heart, but he’s older, more weathered. He’s seen more of the world, done terrible things in his past. He knows that to accomplish his noble goals, he’s going to have to use potentially shady actions - like lying to Amestris about who was really behind the coup, kidnapping Bradley’s wife, and many others. Using the Philosopher’s Stone will help him help people, and while blind he could probably never become Fuhrer. So I like that he chose the more morally ambiguous path, because we know he won’t abuse the station and power that it will get him. We (and he) trust those closest to him implicitly, so it works really well. Edward, who never really lost his moral ‘high ground’, chooses to maintain it and is able to in his own way. Mustang, who feels like he lost his long ago, chooses to make amends for that the best way he can, also in his own way. 

(Also he didn’t technically open the gate himself anyway...)

Anyway, those are what stood out to me most. Other things I loved were Scar’s arc, obviously Alphonse getting his body back, basically any scene with Olivier Armstrong, and much more!",,,1611916016
l6olu6,Psychological-Fall57,writing,"Writing authentic womenSo I’m 19M, working on my first serious novel, and a lot of my characters are women. It’s quite close to a 50/50 split but I have more women than men. Of my two main leads, one is a woman.

My question isn’t “how to write a female character,” and I’m pretty confident in my ability to avoid ending up on r/menwritingwomen and getting laughed at. This is more a question of character voice, and making my female characters actually feel like real women. Distinct character voice is something I struggle with consistently, and reflecting a mix of someone’s identity and personality traits can be a challenge for me. I’m worried that my own narrative voice will shine through too much, and given that I’m a dude, that would make my female characters feel too much like men. 

I know my characters well, I have their backstories and arcs layer out, and they have a variety of personalities ranging from shy troublemaker to cold academic to bubbly socialite - that’s not my problem. I guess my real question to female readers/writers is: what would stand out to you as a really authentic female character? What (other than ridiculous physical descriptions) would stand out as a woman that’s obviously written by a man?

Any advice is appreciated! Also on character voice if you have it, it’s something I’m working hard on at the moment. Cheers :)",,,1611810292
l5fx05,Psychological-Fall57,books,‘The Alloy of Law’ by Brandon Sanderson,,,1611673932
l5fe0i,Psychological-Fall57,Mistborn,"""The Alloy of Law"" - A very different Brandon Sanderson experienceI just finished *The Alloy of Law,* and I thought I'd share my thoughts for anyone who's interested!

I *really* enjoyed this book. I'm a big Sanderson fan, and *The Alloy of Law* is very different from anything else I've read by him. It's much shorter and faster paced with less time spent on worldbuilding, which I found refreshing after having just read *Rhythm of War* and re-read *The Way of Kings.* It's not the slow-burn, deep exploration of character with a loosely defined plot that Sanderson is famous for. Instead, it's fast-paced, has a tight plot, and doesn't take too much time spending time with the characters like Stormlight or Era One did. It feels like everything is being done on the fly, which works well for the story that it it. With that, you lose some things and gain some things. I don't think it's a strength or a weakness, just a fact of what it is. I for one had a great time with it.

***Characters***

I don't mean to say that character is ignored - in fact, the characters are all very strong, layered, and enjoyable. The difference is that it seems like wheras Stormlight is a deep-dive into individual character, *Alloy of Law* is more focused on building the relationships between the characters. It is something that I actually wish Sanderson did more of in his other works, and found this element of the book to be super enjoyable.

*Waxillium Ladrian -* Wax is a good protagonist. He's both different from what I'd call a 'typical' fantasy protagonist and someone I think most people will like. I liked that he was older than your average fantasy character, that he was well-mannered and reserved most of the time, and only broke out of that shell around certain people (mostly Wayne in this book). I really appreciated his careful intelligence, how he thought situations through and made logical decisions rather than being a total firebrand like a lot of fantasy MC's. He's not my favorite protagonist ever, but I really do like him a lot and I'm interested to see where he goes in the future. 

*Wayne -* Wayne is a character I think will be divisive. Whereas Wax's personality is more ""muted"" for lack of a better word, Wayne is the opposite. He has a very strong personality, and that will appeal to some people and others won't be able to stand him. I for one liked him *most* of the time, there were moments when he got a bit annoying but not many. I think he has a lot more layers than we see in *Alloy of Law,* and I'd like to see those explored in later books. His backstory is actually very sad, and the scene where he tells Marasi how he ended up working with Wax was one of the book's best.

*Marasi Colms -* I *love* Marasi; of the main three she may be my favorite. She's kind of a slow burn character, where you don't see her whole self right away. It's not that you don't like her at first, just that she's a bit unassuming (by design, we learn) and over time she becomes a lot stronger of a character. I liked how she's very proper and embarrassed by most things, which is great because she has to hang out with *Wayne* for a lot of the book. I liked seeing how she adapted her sheltered cleverness to the real world, and managed to keep her head even when she felt out of her depth. I look forward to her continuing that arc in the future. Her sort of hero-crush on Wax was pretty adorable and I really liked how both he and her handled it in the end.

*Steris Harms -* I really like Steris, but feel like a lot of people may not. Her personality feels very stiff and dry, but also so realistic. She isn't good at dealing with people, so she has all of her interactions already thought through, which makes her come across as cold. It seems like she's always trying to just ""survive"" social interactions by getting through them quickly, which can give people the wrong impression. I'm curious if she's on the spectrum actually; I've heard Sanderson has written two autistic characters and I think she might be one of them. The final scene with her and Wax where she talks about accepting each other's flaws was one of my absolute favorites, and I'm actually really on board for their relationship.

*Miles Dagouter -* Miles is a great villain, actually. He's properly intimidating with his healing abilities reminiscent of the Lord Ruler, and I liked his philosophies on law and crime. It felt like he was almost a Kelsier in a world that doesn't really need Kelsier, which was a great choice by Brandon imo. He's said before that in almost any other situation, Kelsier would be a villain, and Miles is what I think that could look like. Exploring the difference between a completely broken system like the Final Empire and a flawed but fixable system like Scadrial has now was pretty cool and gave both Wax and the reader a lot to think about. 

***Worldbuilding***

The world was different and one of the coolest parts of the book. The blend of western, urban buddy-cop drama, and Victorian era worked really well. I enjoyed the more minimal approach to worldbuilding - it managed to give a super clear picture of the world without the long-winded explanations of the world that Stormlight has. Again, you gain and lose something with that, but it worked really well for this story, I think. It was great to see all the little references to the original trilogy scattered in there.

Allomancy and Feruchemy were of course used in really clever ways, which is something I've come to expect from Sanderson. Seeing a known magic system interact with new technologies was super well-done, and I appreciated that quite a bit.

***Overall Thoughts***

This was a different Sanderson book, but a great one in my opinion. It's not the same as a Stormlight Archive book or even the Era One books, but it doesn't try to be. It's its own story, almost an alloy of Sanderson's typical style and a bunch of new elements. I had a great time with it, and I'm really exited for the Era Two trilogy.  In classic Sanderson fashion, the last few pages dropped some crazy revelations and I thought that part was amazing.

When I first started watching Rebels, I didn’t mind the animation but did think that TCW’s was better.

Now, though, having just finished Season 3, I can confidently say that the Rebels animation is better than Clone Wars. Some of the moments in this show are legitimately gorgeous, and Clone Wars never got to the same level of beauty. I don’t understand why people hate on the animation of this show so much, honestly.

l1tbc2,Psychological-Fall57,QueerSFF,"The Avatar Kyoshi DuologyHey all, just wanted to recommend something I haven’t seen talked about on here before. If you are/were an Avatar: The Last Airbender fan I’d highly recommend checking out the Avatar Kyoshi duology by F.C. Yee. You don’t have to have watched Avatar to enjoy these (the plots are disconnected) but you’ll probably get a little more out of it if you have and you’ll have to catch up on the worldbuilding as well. But you won’t be lost by any means.

It features a bi girl as the protagonist, and there is a romance between her and another girl throughout the books. Though it’s not the main focus of the story, it’s by no means minor and their relationship gets quite a lot of development. I absolutely loved their scenes together and it’s one of my all-time favorite romances in fiction.

The series is marketed as YA, and I think that’s mostly accurate but it doesn’t fall into many of the common YA tropes that have given many people a bad taste for it. There are certainly brutal scenes, which was a surprise to me given that it’s Avatar, but I found them never to be just there for shock value and they always served a purpose. It also explores very mature themes with its characters, and I thought that this was one of the series’ strongest aspects. The main characters were all very well developed and stand up with my favorite characters from the original series. In fact, Avatar Kyoshi became my favorite Avatar character after reading these books.

So if you want a really good same-sex relationship, well-developed characters, excellent villains, and a good story set in an iconic, well-developed world, I can’t recommend these highly enough! 

The first book is called *The Rise of Kyoshi* and the sequel is *The Shadow of Kyoshi.* I think I liked the first one slightly better, but it’s very close and they’re both great :)",,,1611212924

kxrbvo,Psychological-Fall57,attackontitan,"First Time Anime Watcher's Thoughts on Season One!The Season 4 hype finally got to me, and I started this series after hearing so much about it for so long. Thought I'd share my thoughts and maybe entertain all you veterans with a fresh new fan's opinions on Season 1!

First of all, I definitely am a fan! I really enjoyed Season 1 and am very exited to see where this series goes in the later seasons. The world is unique and engaging, the themes are very well explored, and the writing is excellent all around. I found it to be mostly well-paced, but I did have a slight issue with the frequency and placing of the flashbacks. The action is phenomenal to watch and the questions introduced in this season regarding the titans and the walls are incredibly interesting.

I found this show's greatest weakness so far to be character and relationships. I found the main trio of Eren, Mikasa, and Armin to not be very interesting, especially when compared with the supporting cast. I think the reason for this has been the characters being a vessel to explore the story's themes and ideas rather than their characters themselves. For example, Eren is a representation of humanity's rage, its anger at being imprisoned within the walls and killed like animals, its desire for vengeance, its never-stop-fighting attitude. He doesn't have much more to him than that and he really isn't a good person, but I think that's very intentional. It works for the story quite well, but it's not my personal preference.

Mikasa actually frustrates me quite a bit. I really want to like her, she's such a badass and doesn't take shit from anyone... except Eren. I really dislike their relationship, it feels very one sided with how dedicated Mikasa is to Eren despite being far superior to him in most ways. I don't want to be too quick with the sexism card, but it feels a bit like her whole character is built around him in a way that puts me off honestly. Armin is by far my favorite out of the three. I think he represents fear and courage, and how courage cannot exist without fear. I love that he's weak and comparatively useless in a fight, he is terrified, but he deals with that fear and carries on anyway. And later in the season we got to see his tactical and analytic skills come into play, which was awesome. I hope we see more of Armin's smarts in the future and I'd love to see him in a leadership role.

My favorite character this season was Jean. Of all the many characters introduced, to me he feels the most fleshed out and human and had the best arc. His internal conflict throughout the Trost District episodes was great, especially how Marco's death affected him and influenced his decision to join the Scouts instead of just living for himself in the Interior. I loved seeing him go from being the one everyone hated for being a dick to actually a very competent and dependable soldier by the time the 57th Expedition went down.

I thought the side characters in the 104th were all fun, I particularly like Conny and Sasha's goofy friendship but all of them are cool. Most of them don't get much time or development which I'm fine with for now, but I hope to see more of them in the future. I also *loved* the Scout Regiment in general - Hange, Erwin, and Levi are probably my 3rd, 4th, and 5th favorite characters so far. Again they haven't been explored too much, but I expect that's only a matter of time.

Another stand out character was Annie, I thought she was super interesting and hope we learn more about her and the other human titans' motivation. I think I have a pretty good guess who the Colossal and Armored Titans are, but I'm not sure yet. Their motivations and goals are probably by biggest question going forward. I hope it doesn't end up being a simplistic 'villainous' motivation, but with the complexity already explored so far I don't think it will.

Anyway, those are my thoughts! Cheers guys :)",,,1610703667

kxmk35,Psychological-Fall57,harrypotter,"Films vs Books DiscussionThis post is inspired by a few others I have seen recently regarding the films and the books. I read the books first and love the films, but I don’t think that they did the books justice given how much was left out. So I have a few questions for you good redditors!

If you have watched both, which did you watch *first* and which do you prefer? What aspects of each influence that preference?

If you have *only* watched the movies - does the actual plot make sense? Are there things about the plot that you just don’t understand because of lack of information? The mirror shard in Deathly Hallows is a good example of this... I don’t see how you could know about what that was if you hadn’t read the books first.

I have always maintained that the movies do an amazing job of bringing the world, atmosphere, and characters to life. They are *fantastic* in that regard. But they simplified and toned down most of the characters, and left so much out of the plot that I can’t see them making sense without the background knowledge of the books to fill in the gaps.

Are there any major things about it that aren’t necessary negatives in your mind, but could be to others (obviously that’s very opinionated, but I’d like to hear your opinions)?

And please no spoilers, naturally. For reference I am a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson (I’ve read all of S.A., all Mistborn, Warbreaker) and Andrzej Sapkowski (I’ve read all Witcher except Season of Storms, and played Wild Hunt), among others

ktlzkw,Psychological-Fall57,acotar,"WTF RhysandOkay, I realize this isn’t going to be popular on this sub but...

I am reading ACOTAR for the first time, have been a fantasy reader for years, *huge* fan of the enemies to lovers trope. In fact it’s a big reason I chose to read the series - I know how much everyone seems to love Feyre and Rhysand.

But what the *fuck,* Rhys. I have a general idea of how the romance plays out but honestly this dude is so weird I’m having a hard time seeing him as a future love interest. And again, I love enemies to lovers, so it’s not like I’m opposed to it on principle.

I have just reached the part where he’s licking the tears off her face, and I literally had to stare at that line for a few minutes to figure out wtf I just read. And that was *after* he basically drugged her repeatedly and made her presumably dance like a stripper or something.

TL;DR Rhysand is fucking weird, not shipping :(",,,1610175177

ksvhtp,Psychological-Fall57,Stormlight_Archive,"Brandon Sanderson just became my most read authorI only started reading Brandon’s books this year, but finishing Rhythm of War made him my most read author of all time, judged by amount of separate books read.

I’ve read 9 of his books (SA 1-4, Mistborn E1 1-3, Warbreaker, Skyward), and previously the most I had read by a single author was James SA Corey courtesy of their 8 book Expanse series. My most read by time spent/word count is definitely Rowling owing to all of my many Harry Potter rereads.

I was surprised to have only read 9 books by an author, considering I am a pretty fast/avid reader and go through a lot of books generally.

ksswcm,Psychological-Fall57,Stormlight_Archive,"Adolin TheoryReally quick theory here. It’s a very common theory that Adolin will be able to heal Maya, bond with her, and in doing so become an Edgedancer. I am in the camp thinking that this will happen.

*But* I also think that Maya will refuse to manifest as a weapon, blade or otherwise, because of how long she spent trapped as a Deadeye. In fact it’s likely that she won’t want to manifest physically at all after what she went through.

So Adolin will be a Bladeless Radiant like Dalinar, and will continue the development path he’s on of no longer being powerful and having to adjust to a new role, like he was in Rhythm of War.

This is further speculation, but I feel like he will become some sort of emissary or diplomat between the Spren, Singers, and Humans.",,,1610072397
ks7knn,Psychological-Fall57,KingkillerChronicle,"The Fake Edema Ruh // Wise Man’s FearThe more I think about it, the more I am convinced that the ‘fake’ Edema Ruh troupe that Kvothe kills in TWMF were actually real Edema Ruh. I don’t have a lot of specific evidence, and that is because Kvothe makes it *very* clear that they were not real - suspiciously so, in my opinion. This is where the greater context of the story plays a bigger role than the story itself - Kvothe, in the present, is telling Bast and Chronicler this. He knows Chronicler works as a scribe and is a fairly well known accounter of stories, many of which are preserved and presented as accurate or near-accurate accounts.

I believe Kvothe is flatly lying through his teeth to Chronicler here. There is no *way* that Kvothe, knowing that, would admit that members of the Edema Ruh did what those men did. He is incredibly defensive of the Ruh, and knows that most people hate them enough already - he would not let a crime like that be recorded as attributed to them. In fact, he specifically mentions that it was the Ruh that freed them. I think this line was included not for the girls to share, but for the potential readers of Chronicler’s work. He may or may not have actually said it at the time.

And thinking about this makes me more convinced than ever that we cannot take *anything* Kvothe says at face value. He’s shown to be willing to depreciate himself, but I don’t think that extends to the people he cares about. He’s *self* sacrificing, but wouldn’t tarnish the reputation of the Ruh.",,,1610001412

koz2pj,Psychological-Fall57,Fantasy,"Just finished “The Sword of Kaigen”Wow. I don’t think I’ve ever been so conflicted about a book in my entire life. I finished it about an hour ago, and I genuinely can’t decide if I love it or hate it or something in between.

This book definitely had some *brilliant* moments and the exploration of character was amazing, but I hate the way some of them ended up, so I don’t know what it averages out to.

Whole book spoilers to follow:

&gt;!The duel between Misaki and Takeru. Oh my god was that scene completely brilliant! One of the best scenes I read in 2020 (I finished this book Jan 2 but started it in 2020, so counting it as a 2020 read).!&lt;

&gt;!Misaki was... frustrating. I *loved* her in the first half of the book, so, so much. But I feel like she had so much more potential. Like of course she stayed in Takayubi with her sons, and I actually liked how she ended up respecting/working with Takeru, but staying married to him/loving him?? That I hated. And she never really ended up with any agency over her own story. Maybe that was the point. If it was... I definitely don’t know what to think.!&lt;

Whenever I see art of a person (paintings at a museum, fan art of a character that I don’t know, OC art, whatever as long as I have *no knowledge or preconceived idea of who this person is*) I take a picture/screenshot of it and look at it later. I’ll think up a personality and role to fit that face, and sort of make a character out of them. I write that down, and I have a document with a few of my best ideas. From there, I can fit that into a story somehow and change their described appearance to more closely reflect the worldbuilding of whatever culture they go into.

For example, I was at an Italian restaurant in London about two years ago and there was this painting of a young woman on the wall. Super memorable face, but obviously I have no idea who she is.

It’s hard to pass because the racecourse isn’t all that shifty, and the wind shadow from these boats is long and deadly. Tactical options are removed by virtue of maneuvers being costly.

Snape isn’t like that. He’s a brilliant character, probably more so than Zuko in terms of nuance and layers. He’s also a sleazy, abusive dickhead who caused most of his own problems and blamed them on others. I do pity him, and he’s a wonderful character, but I don’t *like* him.

gpko02b,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"Yeah, I definitely agree. I don’t think I’d have had a problem with energybending had they actually had to figure that out on their own, put in the effort, etc etc.

About the Katara thing: yes, I made a mistake, that’s in the wrong season. Still, though, I have a problem with it because it’s really muddy what “giving up your attachments” actually means. If you are able to give up your attachments only when you need to use the Avatar state and then go back to ‘being attached’ once you’ve accomplished whatever thing you needed to do with it, then... that’s not very compelling, imo, but it’s sort of implied that that’s the case.

I *personally* agree that he should have killed Ozai. However, it’s also good if he makes a choice *not* to kill him and takes on the responsibility of making that work, thereby preserving his cultural beliefs. That’s not what happens, he’s given a solution and the decision is made easy for him.

Another huge problem I had that I didn’t even mention is that Ozai’s true power isn’t his firebending. Sure everyone knows he’s powerful, but he rarely uses it at all to govern the Fire Nation. It’s is influence as a Royal, ruthlessness as a politician, and position of power that’s really the thing they need to dismantle.

gore55a,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"I mean there should be consequences to being a pacifist in wartime. Raised as a monk to live peacefully? Shouldn’t win every single fight (except for one) against a trained military. Choose not to kill enemy soldiers? They should come back to make your life hard later. Choose not to defeat your enemy? Your enemy succeeds and you are to blame for that. Choose to give up the Avatar State in order to preserve your attachments to your friends and crush? You have to fight without the Avatar State. You choose not to kill the Firelord? You have to actually figure out how to stop him anyways without being *handed* a convenient solution by a lionturtle. 

Those are the consequences I mean. It is harder to fight a powerful enemy like the Fire Nation if you hold strictly to ideals of peace. People suffer every day the Fire Nation oppresses them, people die every day under its rule. That much is made very clear. If you choose not to fight them to the best of your ability because you want to hold true to your own culture’s ideals, the consequences are human lives and suffering. 

Is that worth it? It’s a hard question, and the one the narrative has to ask, but doesn’t because the narrative’s ‘right’ answer is just to be good enough of a person that the universe hands you a solution. That’s a huge disservice to Aang’s arc

*Is* it absolutely right to insist on holding true to your culture’s teachings when doing so prevents you from taking action to end a violent, oppressive nation’s war of conquest?

*Is* it right to abandon noble ideals of peace and justice in order to defeat your enemies?

*Is* it right to resort to killing, the very tactics of your oppressor, in order to defeat them?

It’s quite good, actually",t3_lryrep,t1_gophgfx,1614274556
goq74p9,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"That’s the thing though - Aang doesn’t *forge* his own path, his path is *given* to him. He doesn’t *earn* energybending, it’s *given* to him.

What I mean by “are they worth preserving” is exactly what you say - what’s right for him. He is both the Avatar and the Last Airbender. The Avatar has a duty to justice in the world, the Air Nomads have a duty to peace. Those are two *VERY* different concepts, and Aang has to try to balance both. He should have had to consider - *really, actually consider and come to a conclusion of his own* whether the consequences of staying pacifistic were worth the cost he’d pay for doing so. Whether it was right *for him* to continue practicing his Air Nomad ways when people are suffering at the hands of the Fire Nation and he has the Avatar’s duty to fix that. There should have been *consequences* for him choosing what he did, but there aren’t.

Yes, the Air Nomads values are great, and they’re worth following of course. The question should be whether they’re right for *Aang* to follow when he also has a duty to protect the world, which involves combating the Fire Nation.

And again, it doesn’t actually matter what he chooses. I’d be more than happy if he’d made the exact same choice. The problem is that his choice is never actually challenged in a serious way, and we never really see even the potential consequences of him choosing the other path.

A good comparison is the Hama episode with Katara, it’s like a microcosm of the same issue. Katara wants to hold true to her beliefs, and not use bloodbending even though she’s capable of doing so. Her friends are put in danger and she’s capable of saving them, even though it would go against her beliefs. The consequences are readily evident - if she sticks to her beliefs, friends suffer. It’s very clear what will happen. So she chooses to use bloodbending. If she hadn’t, they may have died. Or she may have saved them another way later, but they would have suffered greatly in the time it took for her to do that. The narrative doesn’t let Katara off the hook, it doesn’t give her an easy way out of her choice.

It does with Aang, and therefore his choice feels unearned.",t3_ls0u5u,t1_gopmdr6,1614274154

gnzrj3a,Psychological-Fall57,books,"1. The Witcher books have complex characters and world, but nowhere *near* on the same scale as ASOIAF. In fact, the books are quite short, strangely so for epic fantasy. I’d say they are very accessible and more to my taste than ASOIAF, but they can be confusing at times primarily because of the non-linear storytelling aspects that get used sometimes.

2. Maybe? I read a lot, so my opinion isn’t the most reliable on this, but I’d probably say yes. As mentioned, they are pretty short compared to other fantasy works.

3. I think they start quite slow, and the later books are much faster. Definitely more dynamic towards the end.

Here’s my two cents. The best place to start with the Witcher is the short story collection called *The Last Wish*, which introduces the world and many characters that feature in the series itself. It’s probably best to start here, and since the show is adapted from the short stories (many from this collection, some from the others) your BF will recognize a lot of the short stories and read a more fleshed out, detailed, literary version (the original version). If he likes that, then I’d give the series a try, or at least the other short story collections. 

Obviously one book is a smaller gift than a nice complete series, so I don’t know how that fits into your gift-buying practices. But from a purely reading standpoint, I’d say start with *The Last Wish* and see how he/you like that and go from there. 

Hope this helps! For what it’s worth, I loved this series. If he’s a gamer, you could also check out the games, particularly the Third (you don’t have to play them in order imo). It’s quite spectacular :)",t3_lnbya3,t3_lnbya3,1613730422

Similar at the end of the first Mistborn, how Vin figures out how the LR is staying immortal. I will credit Sanderson for that type of thing 100%.

I’d say that the end of Oathbringer was not my favorite and that he bordered on deus ex machina, but the character moments were so strong that I didn’t mind as much.

Her writing style is elegant but not flowery, her characters are so lovable, the world is awesome and easy to understand, and the book is a good mix of funny and serious/emotional. 

It’s not the heaviest epic fantasy, the book is pretty short, so I think it’s a great starting point.

There are two sequels but the first book stands alone. The second two are really more of a duology with each other, but I really liked both, in fact the second one - *A Gathering of Shadows* - was my favorite of the three.",t3_lj4rvn,t3_lj4rvn,1613239282

gmj0du5,Psychological-Fall57,StarWars,"I didn’t feel the need to pick apart every detail of the detailed, informed, objective analysis because the conclusions of the detailed, informed, and objective analysis are irrelevant to the question we are debating. I read it, I agree with a lot of it, I disagree with some of it, and none of that matters because:

Rey very well may *be* a Mary Sue, and no it does *not* necessarily make you sexist if you think that she is. What I *do* believe to be sexism is the assumption that she was written as one because of her gender, as well as the incredibly visceral reaction many people have to her character, which seems completely out of proportion. 

I like that quote, and I think it’s pertinent. I don’t mean to twist the statements of the article you sent nor do I mean to negate its value, as I believe it makes many good points. I do, however, think that the issue at hand is not directly related to those points.",t3_ldugle,t1_gmizd6m,1612743886
gmix7yw,Psychological-Fall57,StarWars,"Whether she is a Mary Sue or not isn’t really my point. The point is that even if she objectively *is*, people assume that her gender is the cause of her being written that way. That’s not supposition, it’s easy to see in the fanbase. 

I don’t think Rey is a Mary Sue, nor do I think she’s a particularly *bad* character, merely a rather bland one. But it’s hard to deny that she has received hate and criticism *far* beyond what the writing of her character deserves. I’ll admit that it’s not very good, that’s equally hard to deny. But it’s not *bad* either, and certain parts of the fanbase have condemned the character to such a great extent that I find it difficult to believe it’s solely a result of the genuine, existing flaws.

Sabine is a different story: she’s actually a very *good* character, one of the best supporting characters in Star Wars imo. She has a defined backstory, internal conflict, an arc, all of the things Rey haters (legitimately, to some extent) claim Rey lacks. Yet still she is seen as a Mary Sue. Granted, not to the same extent as Rey, but also she doesn’t have three major films built around her character.

Rey is, in my mind, nothing more or less than a main protagonist being written somewhat poorly. The amount of hate she receives is not earned, and a lot of that has to do with the percieved agenda of K. Kennedy and Disney. So I do think Rey’s gender plays a role in the fandom’s perception of her, but not the writing of the character itself",t3_ldugle,t1_gmive3c,1612742202

gluh6w8,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"All good, man, I get it. I think it’s hard for *any* character to carry a show, Zuko included. Aang certainly doesn’t carry ATLA, as Zuko and the Gaang are all very strong supporting characters.

I guess in my little ideal chronology, it would be a pretty ensemble cast, with two or three ‘main’ characters per story, and the others still present as relevant, but with less focus. I feel like Aang would fill that role well - he has a strong worldview and ideology, he’s chosen the way he wants to live and knows pretty strongly who he is. So he should be around, but not the driving force of the narrative, I think.

Anyway, that’s my take. I confess myself biased because I was never Aang’s biggest fan from the start, and always saw him as a fairly effective but not amazingly interesting protagonist. But that said I do think that bias comes from my actual thought process and not just out of nowhere, so it’s definitely a factor in my thinking. 

I also just *love* the supporting characters of ATLA, so I’d want them to get their moment as the spotlight character instead of being supporting characters to Aang’s story all the time",t3_lbj0ab,t1_glugo7t,1612347142
glufuaa,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"I just think that there are way more interesting characters to dive into than Aang. Like he’s a fine protagonist, I like him, but there’s so much more nuance and richness of character to be had with others - particularly Azula, but also Zuko and Katara as well. Aang is pretty... *boring* is the wrong word but it sort of encapsulates what I mean. Basically I wouldn’t want more seasons all about Aang, who we already got 3 seasons all about, when there are five or six way more interesting, deep, layered characters to explore that have thus far been side characters, if that makes sense",t3_lbj0ab,t1_gluff5p,1612345879

glu76e1,Psychological-Fall57,Stormlight_Archive,"I heard someone on this sub once say the Stormlight is the most realistically optimistic series out there, and I agree with that. The doom and gloom sticks around, all the way to the current book, in fact Rhythm of War was probably the most raw yet. But the overall journey of the characters and the message surrounding them is optimistic, and they’re always trying to improve themselves and their situation. So it’s realistic in the sense that the characters’ struggle doesn’t go away just because the situation changes, but optimistic in that the characters themselves push through it in the ways that they are able. 

So yes, and no. It’s definitely not grimdark-style, doom and gloom pessimism, far from it. But the emotional hits never go away. Things get worse, then they get better, then worse again, then better, always. It will be warm again :)",t3_lbibn9,t3_lbibn9,1612338100

glpoxmd,Psychological-Fall57,TheNinthHouse,"Okay, fair on the first point, still a little suspicious on the second.

Their entire society revolves around keeping the Locked Tomb closed and contents inside. Priamhark and Pelleamena presumably (though not for sure) do not know exactly what is inside the Locked Tomb, though I’m sure they know that it is some powerful enemy of the emperor. 

Who, then, is left to guard the tomb when they are gone? Are they not themselves forsaking their sacred duty by taking their own lives? Yes, keeping the tomb locked is a big deal, but the physical act of never opening it seems to be solely for the purpose of keeping the girl inside. That’s the *actual* goal. After Harrow opens it, the girl is still inside. That duty still remains to be performed, right?

Harrow breaking the oldest and most sacred rule is obviously a *tremendous* deal. But it seems to me like the actual oldest and most sacred rule is “keep the girl in the tomb”. That still needs doing, unless the knowledge of what specifically was in the tomb changes their minds in some unknown way. 

Maybe I’m reading too far into this, but it does seem odd that they were just like “oh it got opened once, I guess we can just stop guarding it now even though really our mandate hasn’t changed”",t3_laq840,t1_glpnmhg,1612259046

glaha7p,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"Yeah, you’re definitely right that we shouldn’t gloss over what he did, but I don’t think that anyone does, least of all Katara. She’s the very last one to forgive him, which makes sense for reasons you mentioned. But she does forgive him eventually, she says so outright. Zuko is a changed person - yes, he still has a ways to go, but so does everyone in the Gaang really. So I don’t see why she would inherently never see him as a romantic interest, because she recognizes that he’s felt regret, seen the error of his ways, and changed as a person to someone she now has a lot of respect for. And yeah, she probably wouldn’t stick around in the fire nation, but these people went through a lot together. They’ll see each other again, and remain friends for long after the series. You can develop romantic relationships without sacrificing a character’s individual desires, personality, and cultural values. In fact in my opinion you can *only* develop a romantic relationship if you don’t sacrifice those things",t3_l7rhnk,t1_gl92gbf,1611954345
glaf6af,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"Nah man, I agree that the general way that this discussion is had tends to be pretty bad. Katara is my favorite character, so it does irk me to see people claim that she needs to be in a relationship to be complete as a person or character. But that’s honestly one of my biggest problems with Kataang, actually. While yes there were a lot of little moments across the whole show, the buildup of their actual relationship was really fast and forced in my opinion. Basically during the Ember Island Players, Katara says she’s feeling really unsure, and Aang kisses her anyway, so she basically cuts that particular interaction off and leaves. Then they have the whole very long final battle arc, so obviously they’re not going to be talking about their feelings at that point, they got bigger shit to worry about. Then at the end of that, with no further relationship development, they just end up together. It didn’t feel natural on Katara’s part and didn’t feel like she had a lot of active agency in that relationship, which really bugs me.

So basically, neither Kataang or Zutara should have happened during the show, because it would feel like forcing a relationship on Katara. Going forward from there, Zuko seems like the character Katara would develop a relationship with on her own, on equal terms and agency. That’s my opinion, anyways",t3_l7rhnk,t1_gl9bxct,1611953708
gladbc1,Psychological-Fall57,TheLastAirbender,"I think by the end of the series, Zuko and Katara do have that same core of friendship. They went through a lot together near the end, and they do understand each other’s pain for their respective shitty situations. There were definitely some hinted moments between them in my opinion, and given time I think they could have developed something more. Not to beat a dead long-dead horse, but all of the Kataang moments feel quite forced (by Aang, usually), whereas all of the Zuko and Katara moments seem very back-and-forth, both before and after they were on good terms. And there were definitely some tender moments between them that to me just felt more wholesome honestly than the Kataang stuff",t3_l7rhnk,t1_gla14ya,1611953087

gl8hmzk,Psychological-Fall57,FullmetalAlchemist,"Yeah, that works really well. I think the main difference between Mustang and Ed is that Mustang knows he’s caused many people suffering outside of himself, whereas Ed’s sins only affected himself and Alphonse, who was directly involved anyway and even tells Ed that he is also responsible. So they see themselves as different kinds of monsters, really, and atone for that in different ways. For Ed, it’s not messing with human transmutation again and for Mustang, it’s making sure that those ishvalan souls’ (unwilling) sacrifice actually help to bring about some change for their people.

gl8fafk,Psychological-Fall57,FullmetalAlchemist,"Well I did change my opinion on that, but my initial reasoning was that Truth doesn’t seem to care about anything except upholding the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Mustang saw the Truth, ergo he should pay for that knowledge. I was more concerned with how Ed had to give up his entire gate and ability to do alchemy to get back Al whereas Mustang got his sight back “easily”, relatively speaking.

My characters personalities are more well-developed that what I mentioned, those were just quick summaries. I think I have really complex, realistic personalities for them planned out, it’s just representing that on paper in the actual writing that I’m having trouble with.

I think of characters as a blend of many, many factors, including gender. It’s falling back on my own experience with my own gender that I’m worried about, if that makes sense.

We will *either* see her become an Azula-esque villain or a Zuko-esque redeemed antagonist. Either she’ll be one of the main antagonists, but we’ll understand and feel sorry for her, or she’ll struggle and suffer her way back to the side of good like Zuko did.

But either way, it will be *better* than it was in Avatar, presuming they write the story as well as they have been. Because no matter what happens, we’ll have seen Claudia’s *entire* progression. She’s introduced as a protagonist, someone Callum has a crush on, and only reluctantly becomes an antagonist at first. That descent, choice by choice, into villainy will make whatever direction they choose to go with her more effective and impactful. With Zuko and Azula, we don’t see that story. We get it in flashbacks, and we know what happened, but we don’t *see* it unfold beat by beat like we do with Claudia.

By the time Half-Blood Prince comes around, the others his age (or younger) have probably surpassed him in skill. We see this with Ginny, who could play both seeker and chaser, winning gryffindor two Quidditch cups while Harry only managed to win one.

If you want recommendations, I can certainly give some! I read mostly fantasy with some of other genres thrown in there from time to time.

If you like psychology and books that make you think, I’d recommend *The Secret History* by Donna Tartt. It’s Dark Academia with really sort of deep, almost twisted characters that will really give you something to ponder.

This is my only disagreement with anything you’ve said. I don’t think it portrays the anger itself as bad, my issue is what it does with the characters who embody that anger. I thought Rhythm of War did a really bad job with Moash’s character, for reasons you pointed out, and the part of Kaladin that hated lighteyes has sort of... disappeared, in a way. My personal opinion is that lasting change always has to come from within the system, but as you pointed out that often happens as a result of pressure from outside of the system. It seems like Jasnah’s reforms come from her just being more woke than anyone else, which is great and all, but ignores the effect people like pre-RoW Moash could have.

And I really don’t like that the singers are the villains of the series, in fact this is my biggest complaint so far. I think I’ll do a post about this when I can sit down and think things out properly, because it’s something I’m really disappointed in so far.

But the more I think about it, the more I think it’s really good writing. She deals with her trauma in really unhealthy ways, and that’s something I think a lot of people do to some extent. Certainly I myself do at times, so I see some of myself in her. Maybe that’s why I didn’t like her so much.

As pointed out to me by some good redditors, Rhythm of War is her backslide book, similar to how Oathbringer is Dalinar’s and Words of Radiance is Kaladin’s. People can be frustrating, and that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad character work.

So I see where you’re coming from, and I used to agree. But now I actually disagree. My opinion on her has changed several times over the course of the series, even without rereading or reading any new material. Maybe yours will as well, or maybe not.

But actually way back on Way of Kings, *Kaladin* was doing something similar. He thought of all of his failures in terms of their effect on himself, rather than anyone else. He doesn’t realize that until Wit’s story about Derethil and the Wandersail.

Basically with Venli, every criticism of her is right. She is selfish, she is terrible, she isn’t a good person. But she *is* changing, slowly - realistically, in my opinion.

Cultivation’s influence allowed him to change and become an example, and his struggle came from accepting responsibility for his past actions anyway. Venli doesn’t have that guiding hand to help her change - in fact she’s completely alone for most of Oathbringer except for Timbre.

A: I do, actually, but that doesn’t really excuse her. When she first found out that Eshonai had died, when she still believed that she would be treated like a hero, it was her remorse and her pain that prevented her voidspren from completely taking over her mind.

I think the Armored Titan is Reiner.

Eren’s dad is also sus as hell. I would very much like to know what he is up to, what’s in his basement is obviously a big unknown to me at this point and that will probably answer a lot of other questions.

I think for the most part, the films did an amazing job playing to the film genre’s strengths (building an atmosphere, establishing tone and character voice, fleshing out a detailed setting, etc) but an inconsistent job at mitigating it’s weaknesses (having to cut important exposition for time, weakening of many side characters such as Ginny, condensing of plotlines, etc). In some movies it’s perfectly fine (Sorcerer’s Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban are great examples) and in others I had serious complaints (Goblet of Fire and Half Blood Prince in particular)

I think Brandon Sanderson is a good example of this done well with his work with mental health in his books.

It is slow paced in the middle, but not any more so than Way of Kings or Words of Radiance. And the ending speeds up a lot as usual, but not as much as the other books.

When she is being ‘attacked’ by the Cryptics, she starts to summon the blade and is interrupted, and it never comes. She also calls it the “fruit of her most heinous act” or something like that, which on my first read I thought meant she had killed her father and took his blade, but now I think it means killing Testament after she killed her mother.

giudul4,Psychological-Fall57,harrypotter,"Sure! It’s different for each. Sirius is a wonderfully written character imo, but he’s loved for all the wrong reasons by the fandom, I think. A lot of people see him as a substitute father figure for Harry, when really he was more of a stand-in friend/brother who saw Harry more as James than anything else. He tried to live viscariously through Harry, and his recklessness put his friends in danger frequently. That all makes sense, of course, and it’s great character work, but I can’t really bring myself to *like* him as a person. And it bugs me when people put him on a pedestal as this great pseudo-father for Harry, when really he was far from. The movies’ depiction of him has a lot to do with that perception, I think.

Dobby and Hagrid are different. They just annoy me to be quite honest. Hagrid was very frustrating throughout the books with his teaching and his reaction to their opinions of it, he was really all over the place at times and it annoyed me quite a bit. Dobby is sort of the same in that he’s all over the map at times, but he’s definitely alright. I just don’t feel the emotional attachment to him that I do to the other characters, he’s very ‘meh’ for me.

Ginny, Neville, and Luna are just great and I wished we saw more of them :)",t3_kuukrn,t1_giu9yc4,1610341451

It’s unpredictable that she’d end up warming to him, but for me it was also unsatisfying. The same goes with her place in society - the progression of her gaining agency is somewhat undermined by the fact that she doesn’t ever really break out of the role her society has forced onto her, instead learning to accept/be content with it.

The same way there are certain restrictions for heterosexual relationships the same holds true for homosexual so they are both in the same boat. So I don't know why they act like they are so oppressed in religion

Second of all there is either gay (or lesbian) and straight (I guess bi also). Not pan. Not demi. Not latin roots you pull out of your ass. Not omni not anything else. 

Third of all is how plain stupid transgenderism is. There are two genders and it is what you were born as. You don't get to choose it and you don't get to claim that you feel like something else. Gender dysphoria is a mental illness and I dont know why but nowadays we have decided to accept it as normal and that is completely wrong. If I can choose my gender why can't I choose my race or my age or my species? It becomes stupid and pointless and completely devalues the actual objectivity of gender. There are actual differences between men and women (NOT THAT ONE IS DOMINANT OVER THE OTHER. SOMETHING CAN BE DIFFERENT AND EQUAL. APPLES AND ORANGES MAY BE DIFFERENT BUT THEYVARE BOTH FRUIT) 

And there are only two genders. No non-binary cause that doesn't even make sense. If gender is a social construct different from sex that means that all of that pronoun stuff that you choose for yourself is nothing more than a cry for attention. Thats why we have had an objective way of determining pronouns for centuries.

I dont even know what the hell asexuality is all about. Not wanting to have sex isn't a sexual preference.

gqw78mu,coolguydude56,Jewish,"The chofetz chaims point is once again about speaking with megative intentions. You are making the same exact point that I am making. Yes I believe that lashon hara is bad and that speaking badly about another Jew is wrong even if it's true (I actually know a really interestimg story about the chofetz chaim. If youd like i can tell you after). However when I say that if I speak about it I will get banned I mean it like this:

1) This sub doesnt really allow debating about the legitimacy of the laws of someones denomination like say reform even if you bring proofs and sources from torah and halacha. I have done this (completely legitimately without any evil intention. Merely to point out logical flaws and contradictions of the Torah) and gotten banned because the sub doesn't tolerate that kind of debate which is the problem in my opinion.

Also like I said earlier if it comes to the name ofngod and upholding its value and meaning one is allowed to degrade them out of love in order to help them on the right path and bring them to a higher spiritual level. For instance it is why the gemara encourages school teacher to chastise a child by hitting his hand if he misbehaves (not that Im really a fan of the ruling). Or when king chizkiyah if im not mistaken was permitted to drag his fathers bones (Ahav) disrespectfully in the dirt because his father perverted the name of God and led other Jews to incorrect practices and even idolatry. (The story is mentioned in the gemara on the last gemara of Masechet Makkot)

If one is permitted to even disrespect one's father in order to teach if something about the legitimacy of the torah how much more so must we do to our fellow Jews out of love. 

Lastly i just want to say I am enjoying this conversation and Im glad we are able to have it. Debating is what Judaism js all about since we know  we always have central points we can always agree on. If this gets me banned even though i love my fellow Jew and just want to help them I hope we can continue this in DMs.",t3_m4kye1,t1_gqw5kub,1615725357
gqv9qdj,coolguydude56,Jewish,"Lashon Hara can only be consodered bad if the person saying it has evil intentions. If your intention was to help people and explain that what they are doing is wrong (no matter how harsh it may seem) then it is not considered lashon hara but ratuer praised in the torah

The torah and gemara is very clear on what you should do in situations where you need to explain to your fellow jew and brother (or sister) that what they are doing is wrong. All of Israel is responsible for one another (כל חשראל עריבים זה לזה) and the torah regards the allowance of someone to sin without even at least making them aware of it as heinous as committing it yourself.

If it comes down to defending gods name and sparing the feelings of another the former comes first. If we are obligated to give our life just in order to not even seem like we are following a different religion kal vachomer how much more so must we defend Gods name from within",t3_m4kye1,t1_gqv6gil,1615694856

 I am not saying that the second group isn't real Jews. They are definitely real jews. However they are too extreme and are condemned for heir extremist views. No they are not anti-semitic. But unless your reasoning is equivalent to their reasoning (which is that because the Jews are the one true religion and the Jewish God is real we must wait for Messiah before receiving Israel) then yeah buddy you not wanting the Jews to have a homeland is anti-semitic. Unless of course you want to say that Judaism is the true religion and you intend to follow the laws of Judaism because you believe that our God is real and you plan to convert.

I believe they are being extremist and have a matter of disagreement with their ideals.* You on the other hand are just a dumbfuck who is anti-semitic and believes false news.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the link you sent: I am well aware of that video. 1) r/Publicfreakout is notably antisemitic and antizionist so stfu

2) That video was cut short. The IDF soldiers upon realizing the man was wounded stepped back and allowed him to be taken to the hospital. Full video is [here](https://twitter.com/RamAbdu/status/1331364355863162882). AND that is from a palestinian source so you know I'm being non partisan.

3) Do your actual unbiased research on the Palestinian-Israeli issues.",t3_lpn2tb,t1_goi9qnx,1614116267
gohwxqm,coolguydude56,HistoryMemes,"\&gt;  After they beat up old Palestinians, displace the from their home, discriminate against Palestinians, kill Palestinian protestors, some of them being children, illlegally blockading the Gaza strip, and generally being an asshole. 

Ok first of all your claim that they ""beat up old palestinians etc. is complete bullshit thank you very much.

Second of all no I am not saying that the second group isn't real Jews. They are definitely real jews. However they are too extreme and are condemned for heir extremist views. No they are not anti-semitic. But unless your reasoning is equivalent to their reasoning (which is that because the Jews are the one true religion and the Jewish God is real we must wait for Messiah before receiving Israel) then yeah buddy you not wanting the Jews to have a homeland is anti-semitic.

gohw9t8,coolguydude56,HolUp,"Ok and also look at statistics of crime rates between whites and blacks and then proport that with percent of total population each group takes up. (I'm talking about convictions NOT suspected)

The police need to do their job. They cannot do that if they must assume everyone is an innocent person and they obviously can't ignore statistics. I'm NOT saying that more white people are innocent and I'm NOT sayign Black people are all criminals. Nor am I saying that cops should pull people over based on the color of their skin. I'm saying that pulling someone over and then attributing the reason why they got pulled over to racism is a lame ""get out of jail free"" card that people are eating up. If the police suspect something then they have the right to pull someone over and check them out. That is their job. Do I believe the police are perfect? No. Are there bad people in the police? Yes for sure. But to defund them and call everyone who isn't black racist is NOT the course of action to take.",t3_lqcx7d,t1_gohrd9h,1614108887
gohqbrq,coolguydude56,HistoryMemes,"Actually many real Jews condemn the IJAN and believe them to be a stupid organization with absolutely no proof to back up their claims that Israel is supposedly an ""apartheid state"" and is ""Evil"".

As for the second group of Ultra-Orthodox chassidim. I am well aware of that group and their reasons for opposition. Unless you oppose Israel for the reason that you believe the true God is the Jewish God and that the messiah of the JEws must come and we must live like the Chassidim until the Messiah comes I'm afraid your argument is completely derailed. Unless that is the reason you oppose ISrael I suggest you don't try and use them as an argument. It will only make you look foolish. They are a small splinter group and their actions are not supported by any Jews except those in their own groups. Even most Ultra-Orthodox chassidim don't support them

And he was not killed because he was Black and the there is no proof whatsoever of systemic racism.

The word Palestinian was not in reference to a people until 1948 (So already your claim of them being there for ""centuries"" is false) Before that, the word simply meant anyone who lived in Israel (I say Israel because that is what it is now) which meant any Jew, Christian, or Muslim. Once the Jewish state was established many of the Muslim Arabs who lived there decided to call themselves Palestinians and claim that it is their land.

In addition the land has belonged to the Jews and it is KNOWN that the land belongs to the Jews and has since before the word Palestinian even existed. Jews lived in that land and called it Israel from centuries before the Roman Empire was even a bunch of mud huts in Italy.

1. The shot was proven BY THE ARTICLE YOU BROUGHT that it was not aimed at the medic but rather was an accidental ricochet from where it struck the ground. It was an unlucky shot (as stated by your article) and the calls that it is a ""war crime"" is clearly only speculation by anti-Israel groups and isn't actually a credible statement.
2. This is a skeleton article from a known biased and unreliable news source. It provides no background and all it does is discuss a video that anyone can have acces to. You don't know nay background or any info about what happened. The purpose of that article is to paint Israelis in an evil light as it attempts to make the claim that Israeli citizens support murder.
3. I can't read this one without a subscription and I'm not paying just so I can tell you you're wrong. 
4. Same thing as link number 1 that you sent except this time it is by a notoriously biased source. The New York Times is extremely anti-semitic and anti-zionist.

Israel immediately apologized and an investigation was conducted by Israel and US concluding that it was a total accident.

Second of all it was never Palestinian land. They settled on land that belonged to Jews. In fact before 1948 the word Palestinian meant any Muslim, Jew, or Christian who lived in Israel. There was never a Palestinian ""people"".

Third of all Israel did not expand its territory past the Yom Kippur War. Perhaps you are thinking of the Lebanon War? Israel did not keep land from that war and the reason they were involved was because they needed to create a separation of land between the Northern Israel settlements and the terrorist organizations in Lebanon that kept attacking (For example: Hezbollah). They worked with the SLA and gave up anything it had in terms of control once it had safely stopped terrorist attacks. The IDF had completely withdrawn from Lebanon in order to promote peaceful relations.

Fourth of all Palestinians are not Natives, have never been natives, and have never been removed from their lands. They refused to live under a Jewish government and many of them fleed for no reason and made themselves refugees for no reason in other arab countries. Israel had no part in removing them and the only time they remove people from their homes are if they are known terrorists.

Fifth of all if you're worried about people being treated as second class citizens don't look at Israel where it doesn't happen. How about you look at most of the rest of the world that treats Jews as their own lower class of citizen.

gjnrx00,coolguydude56,tumblr,"You are Catholic. This conversation isn't about you. And I was making possibilities for why God may have not allowed homosexuality. Of course there is more to life than mere procreation and marriage has it's own commandments from God without procreation. But homosexual sex does not have anything other than sexual pleasure.

Taking a walk on the beach and watching the ocean actually is a positive commandment from God. It is marvelling in his creation and appreciation the beauty of the world that he created for humanity. 

I don't know exactly why God does not permit homosexual sex. All I know is that he does not. A lively debate on his reasoning is what this conversation is about. I assure you I mean no offense.

You support gay rights and go against the ruling of that pasuk and your argument is self contradictory and therefore invalid

You do not support gay rights and agree with me that it is forbidden by God since God clearly states it in the Torah (Vayikra 20:13 and 18:22) and since because of the pasuk you referenced we don't ""get with the times"" and update the laws and rules you must condemn gay people",t3_kz807p,t1_gjlzoc5,1610901282

3. Gay sex gives nothing to the world and is merely about pleasure. Whether its from love or from sexual.

4. It is a waste of the holy sperm

You asked for reasons why it is forbidden by God. I assure you I don't want you to follow in my religion. But when the world was created there were 7 laws that the world (outside of my religion) was obligated to follow. Not involving in forbidden relationships was one of them (which involves homosexuality)",t3_kxkvet,t1_gjk1inn,1610890778
gjjvdfk,coolguydude56,tumblr,"The difference between me and you is I have faith. I know that the ""book I'm quoting"" wasn't written by a bunch of random men who ""claimed to have heard God"". You see my religion believes that every person has the capacity to speak to God. It's just a matter of spiritual level. And when we received our ""holy book"" it wasn't given to one man. It was God themself who spoke to every man, woman, and child at the base of Har Sinai (mount Sinai to you). It's an experience passed down from generation to generation. It was not one man claiming to have seen God. God gave all of us the book to learn, question, and understand. Your vision on what religion is, is flawed by your obstinate belief that you are capable of understanding God. You aren't. Either you agree that there is the one true God who gave us his Torah and you at least respect the Noahide laws or you suffer the consequences. That's your choice since God gave us all free will.

In response to your claim that I should be wary of being judgemental: I am not being judgemental. You said it yourself that you are lesbian so I'm just responding to that. I don't know what sin you have other than that. In fact I was speaking generally before but since you mentioned you are lesbian now I'll also speak directly to you if that makes you happy.

In my religion we believe that is important to try and warn someone to lead them on the right path. In fact because of the juxtapositionous placement of the 3rd quote I brought for you (Devarim 22:5) we learn from that that Otis our responsibility to try and place people on the path of God. My religion requires deep understanding and an open mind. You see your life as ""harmless pleasure"" and that you know better than ""the personal opinions of men who lived a thousand years ago"" (which is NOT what the Torah is.) Whether or not you go to hell is not up to me. I'm not going to pretend I have the infinite wisdom and knowledge and decide whether you go go heaven or hell. But I can tell you that those actions we discussed aren't going to help your case when you stand before the בורא עולם (creator of the universe) after a long fulfilling 120 years of life.

And just so you know the basis of my religion is critical thinking. We spend hours arguing, debating, reasoning, explaining every possible letter from the Torah. We have filled countless books and argued thousands of different ideas. One of the most famous of all examples is the 'Gemara'. Search it up and even read through the beginning a little. It's online on a website called mercava. [Here's a link to the beginning](https://www.themercava.com/app/books/metanav/1695) you'll find it incredibly complicated and requires much critical thinking. I have been studying it for 12 years and i feel i barely scratched the surface. Next time please at least know who you are talking to before you insult me by telling me I have no critical thinking admi follow things blindly. I assure you my lack of blindly following orders has gotten me in trouble more times than I can count. Now whos being judgemental.

Fin fact: The Gemara is the reason there is a stereotype in my religion that we are all such good lawyers and bankers.

Although i would say this that Snape had the highest ceiling to become the best teacher(of DADA), perhaps even surpassing Lupin if he had his compassion, since the dude could literally invent spells and perhaps the most in-depth dark arts knowledge second only Voldy and Slughorn(maybe).

l2ikvc,datavinci,ExperiencedDevs,"I have found that asking interviewers in the agile culture has helped me filter out lot of companies with dicey working conditions.Now disclaimer first: This does not always work, people lie/ exaggerate etc. 

But I was surprised by asking out a couple of questions related to agile:-

1. Sprint length? Frequency of sprint retro(start with easy questions and mix them with the real qs)

2. How do they consider estimates and formulate deadlines for features?

3. How much velocity do they assign to team members? any buffers?

4. How do they handle ad hoc situation which may arise during the sprint?

5. How do they handle requirement changes when the development has already started?

6. Prodding about scrum masters also helps a lot. Many places have a seperate scrum master, rather than lead or manager taking it up. Usually these are nothing but micromanagers most of the time. yet to meet a standalone scrum master that has been useful in their role. Best ones in my experience have been tech leads taking up the scrum duties.

Now u might see this questions as quite trivial, and this method is far from being foolproof, but many interviewers ended up answering to this, and it was really revealing about the workplace.

One guy told me they considered estimates as deadlines, it became dev's responsiblity to deliver. They communicate these estimates given by dev to sales team and upper management. No intervention by product owner, I got to know by further prodding. Needless to say, devs were overworked most of the time.

At another place, they expected devs to roughly estimate requirement changes in their estimates(lool).

One place chastised devs if they added buffer to their estimates.

Obvious red flags sure, but a lot can be learnt if u know where to prod.

gniolkl,datavinci,reddevils,"We seem to pay way too much for dank average players and this could have multiple negative effects like:- 

1. When we approach a club for players, they will alaways quote a higher number since we are Man Utd who are known to pay hillarious amounts of money for average players.

2. We give very high salaries to players. Although, after Sanchez, Woodward seems to have learnt a lesson but even still, I find salaries of some players to be extremely high. Take Martial for example. Dude's on a 250k pound per week salary. Here are some other players who are on lesser salaries:- 
Salah - 200k, Van Djik - 180k, Harry Kane - 200k, Bernardo Silva - 110k, Sergio Aguero(only slightly less but less nonetheless) - 230k. these are some world class players who contributed to their team not just in the league, but in Europe as well. They have been one if not the key players to their squad. Do we really think Martial has put in performances to be included in this company of players I think not.


3. Just because we are amongst the highest earning football clubs in the world does not mean we hand out salaries like freebies. Otherwise, many players will continue to treat our club as cash cows and we might end up like Arsenal has.

4. We need a transfer selection committee that has proper football knowledge and long term vision so as to make most of the transfers stick.

Big doubt. A guy on faster broom has significant more advantage than any of the other analogies u mentioned. Sure u need good motor skills to stay afloat and skillfully navigate through. But broom speed and ease of use absolutely does matter.

It's like saying driving ferrari want help u against a guy driving a fiat. it absolutely will. U will need driving skills, but a faster car at the end of the day is a faster car.

August, 2019 (I think), I am ADDICTED, I've read all 7 books and are emotionally attached to the characters and I wanna go to Hogwarts

Problem is though in August, my friend was going to a different state, so i had to read FAST, so i ended up being kind of confused (especially in CoS)

January, 2021, I decide to look on an ebook website called Sora and some of the books were available, and even though there was a deadline, I finally read thoroughly and I love it even more

February, 2021, I get all 7 books (finally), and I start to read Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone again

And it SOOOOOOOOOOO much more enjoyable

For some reason the characters are more funny / enjoyable/ even hateable in some cases, Hogwarts is so much cooler, etc... And I am officially dubbing this as the ""Your Own Book"" phenomena

For some reason, taking time reading your own book actual book (no going fast, reading an ebook, or borrowing a friends book), is so much more enjoyable, I have no clue why, its one of those things science can explain (or maybe it can i dunno)

I know i sound like a marketing agent, but hear me out, I think the ""Your Own Book"" phenomena is an actual thing",,,1613347554

well obviously the stat is the title and I'm not typing that out again, but anyway, most people would say this is a bad thing, and that we should have more control over the ball, but I see this as a testament to how efficient we are with the ball. think about it

Aaron Rodgers - 48 passing TD's, 3 rushing TD's, 51 in total

Jones, Williams, Dillon - 13 rushing TD's 

Mason Crosby - 16 FG's

Defense - 2 TD's

That means on 80 out of 990 plays, we scored points, that also means 8.28% of our plays ended up either through the uprights or in the end zone

Now that's pretty Damn Impressive

Also, I must add that using this isn't the best due to field goals also being there, so this does not necessarily mean that one team scores more points than the other, for example, if a team scores 5% of the time, but it's just FG's that does not mean that at the end of the season, they will have more points than a team that has only scored 4.5% of the time, but they only scored TD's",,,1609900571

m3bs48,Vocadofries,ApplyingToCollege,"I love you allAye If you can relate - So back in March (you know, March 2020) when things got cancelled, I’d get pissed. And sad. The model un conference I researched for? Yeah, nOpe. Prom? You wish. Watching my seniors graduate? The summer program Ive been wanting to apply to since 6th grade? Even making up with my friends? Nope, nope, nope. And sometime in the last 12 months, I’ve gotten so acclimatized to this bs that I don’t even react to cancellations or bad news anymore. The suckiness of life is just a fait accompli. I used to think one of my greatest abilities through this pandemic was being able to accept all the unfortunate realities and look forward. 

 I’ve finally accepted my pessimism. All those times seeing the rants and sadness and encouragements on A2C, I always thought I’d never be like that. Because I was optimistic, and I had stuff to look forward to, and that I have so much planned for me, and I’ve already done so much.  And after this emotional mood swing, I’m going to go back to that optimistic student who loves learning and sharing everything I have to help the people around me. But with this type of weak mental coping mechanism, there’s always going to be a point where the suckiness of life reaches a max and I need to face everything that’s happened head on. 

As I get accepted into colleges, it’s so hard to celebrate because one of my friends was rejected, or something of the sorts. I just know that there’s someone out there that has it worse than me, so it helps me trudge on. I’ve been taking to all my teachers who have generously helped me to this point of my life, and every time I share with them an accomplishment or acceptance, I still feel so empty inside, because all my disappointment has been bottled up. 

This is the most wack transition, but Here comes the sappy positive note: no matter what, there’s someone out there who’s proud of you. If you get rejected from your safety school, or accepted into hogwarts, that person (whether they tell you or not) is proud. You should be proud that you can make it this far and put your best effort into dealing with the crap that life threw at you. If no one else is there, IM proud of you. Damn, I’m proud of us. Even without this dumbass pandemic, I’m proud of you and all the uncertainty and insecurity you’ve overcome and will overcome. Let’s get it gang",,,1615530778

Many people take part in the challenge in order to raise money for a cause, and for each small donation received, the poster will do the challenge of equivalent value.

I just don't like when people will directly send me the challenge and ask me to donate money. Like, I get that $1-5 isn't that much, but I was raised not to spend unnecessary money, even if it was a couple cents. I have my own organizations that I contribute my time to. For these bingo boards, I feel awkwardly pressured when I'm asked to donate a small amount of money. Like, I feel horrid by implying I won't even spare $2, and if I do donate $2 or even $5, it feels like not enough. But I just never spent money that way, and it's so uncomfortable, especially when the person requesting is a good friend or someone I look up to.

l9okcu,Vocadofries,unpopularopinion,"Teaching people to ""not say sorry for something you didn't do wrong"" is training excessive narcissism and creates difficult groupwork habits.This might get downvoted to hell but hey ig that's why this is an unpopular opinion.

I understand why some people are told they shouldn't apologize for everything. But this mindset is somewhat glorified in individualistic societies, causing a bunch of arrogance issues. Now, many simply have a hard time recognizing that they messed up. Whereas a simple apology could easily resolve conflict, I rarely ever see people (especially leaders) admit they made the wrong decision.

So many people are taught that to defend their own ideals, stay true to their morals, and stick to their values - ""hAvE mOrE coNfiDenCe"". To a point where Person B will refuse to apologize; instead Person B would end up shifting blame onto Person A and only exacerbate conflict. I respect people who can stay calm and just admit they were wrong, *especially* when they don't understand why.

Especially in conflicts caused by someone's discretion, it's an extreme ego-bruiser to just say, ""Sorry, I fucked up."" But people need to be taught to apologize even if they don't understand why they were wrong, instead of blindly arguing. At most points, people won't understand why their decision was wrong at the moment. And, even if the person made the right decision and is being wrongfully reprimanded, it doesn't hurt to come back the next day and say, ""even though you may think X, I still believe Y is correct because xyz"" Especially in fast-paced work environments, not being able to recognize fault will stunt growth. Rather than teaching people to ""not apologize for something you didn't do wrong,"" I believe societies should  emphasize how people's values are always shifting, and that it's okay learn and change your values even if you vigilantly defended them before",,,1612134342

And then later one of them told me that a bunch of guys had crushes on me but they were scared of me. Also mentioned that another one of his friends was talking to me but was too scared to ask me out.

But like how am I scary??? I literally don't know. Like I'm the dorkiest nerd in my class who self-plugs  academic clubs at school functions.

gr3r9rv,Vocadofries,nextfuckinglevel,"Yeah, but tattooing in Chinese history happens to have a more defamatory/undesirable connotation. Not that tattoos were bad, but that it wasn’t common practice, and the practice made its way into stories where tattooing would permanently remind the person of a failure (and thus encourage them to work harder, not unlike current tattoos). Remember, there’s are no tattoo machines so obviously if one were to be inked back in the day, it was needles and all that jazz all the way. 

tattoos do make its way into some Chinese literature early on, with both positive and negative connotations. Apparently starting around year 900, we have evidence that tattooing was a practice in southern China in the zhou dynasty in Liji (a scholarly book on Confucian conduct). A military general had a tattoo on his back to remind him to fight for his people. But anyways, it seemed to always be a form of “defiling” the body in ancient times. When China turned communist, the communist party basically banned tattooing because they deemed it “immoral”. Tattooing comes as more common with minority, non-Han groups in Chinese land. 

I believe tattooing was most popular in Southeast Asia, with traditional Thai tattoos or Malaysian tattoos. Many western people choose to get tattoos done the traditional Thai way for symbolic meaning.",t3_m5xe5w,t1_gr3oaq9,1615884918

m2107z,LiopleurodonMagic,Type1Diabetes,"Husband (26M) has had several severe lows in the past 5 months to where I wake up to him drenched in sweat and violently twitchingDiagnosed at 16, now 26.

During these times I use the [insta glucose](https://imgur.com/a/uF3Cvsh) and squeeze it into his cheek. These have seriously been a complete life saver and I recommend everyone getting these or some form of them. I then feed him glucose tablets. He is still conscious enough to chew these but he doesn’t seem to have any idea what’s happening. He’s just sort of spaced out and his whole body is twitching including jerking his arms and moving his legs. 

This just started happening about last October, but since then it’s probably happened about 10 or more times. Always at night and it’s always very scary. I stay calm though and administer the glucose and the tablets and tell him it’ll be okay. It typically suddenly just fades and he sort of blinks and looks at me realizing what’s happened. The first time it happened he didn’t seem to register it at all and I had to tell him what had just happened. When he is stable enough he checks his sugars and they’ll be in the 40-50 range after all of the glucose. I get him a carb drink and a snack and we just sort of wait to see where his blood sugar goes.

The past week he’s been trying to get back into actively working out. This has led to 2 of these episodes in a week. The last one happening last night. He said he reduced his basal by 30% and it shouldn’t be happening anymore but it is. He is debating just turning his Omni pod off at night to avoid these incidents.

At this point I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified of going to sleep and me waking up to him dead. He’s supposed to go to a bachelor party later this month and I’m scared he’s going to have one of these episodes and no one will know what to do. He has a CGM (libre freestyle) that he doesn’t often wear because of cost (and annoyance of them) but he said when he goes to the bachelor party he’ll be wearing it. 

Any advice? Anyone have these issues when they’ve started working at again? Any else experience these “episodes” and found something that worked?

Today (March 3rd) we received 2 letters both dated February 25th claiming that we had not moved the trashcans and it included the same picture (it is time stamped January 13th just as the first). The first letter said we were fined $50. The second letter said because we did not pay the first $50 fine that we were being fined an additional $150. Also both letters said “First inspection January 13th, last inspection January 13th” along with the picture from January 13th. We have videos of our trashcans in our backyard (I take a lot of pictures of my dog in my backyard) up until February 20th. We also have a neighbor who said he will back up that we moved our trashcans. 

My husband called the HOA line and explained the issue. The woman on the phone agreed that this didn’t add up and said he needed to email a woman who had the power to remove the charges. He emailed her right after the call. 

The woman emailed back an hour ago stating that the HOA doesn’t need to prove that the trashcans were visible with a photo they just had to note that they were visible on February 25th. This makes absolutely no sense as we know the trashcans were in our backyard and outside of that Feb 25th was a Thursday. Our trash day is not until Monday so the trashcans would not in any way even be outside for any reason. When my husband took out the trash this past Sunday night the trashcans were in the backyard and he moved them to the curb as were supposed to. Then moved them back into the backyard on Monday evening. I took the trash out recycling out. I know they were in the backyard on Feb 25th .Despite all of this, they are claiming that we still owe the $200. $50 for the initial fine and $150 for not paying the fine. 

What are our legal options here? Would this be handled by small claims court? Can an HOA really get away with not showing evidence? Please let me know if any additional information is needed.

Edit: for some reason I cannot comment on anyone’s responses. Thanks for all of your advice though. I’ll update if anyone changes but for now we’re going to see if we can go to a meeting or escalate inside the HOA.",,,1614816284

lpfiy2,LiopleurodonMagic,Plumbing,"Young homeowners in over our heads with water heater sedimentLong story that I’m going to try to cut down. Live in north Texas. Experienced cold snap. Never lost water but was on a boil notice for about 4-5 days. When water was deemed “safe” we were told to flush both hot and cold water. We ran cold water through taps for 5 min. Ran hot water for 10 min. When we ran the hot water a whole bunch of sediment (looked just like sand) was coming out of taps. After fixing the sediment clogs in the aerators and letting the water run some more we decided to empty the hot water tank through the release valve and a hose on the tank. We read about doing this and we’re recommended to do it because of all of the sediment accumulation. We have lived in this house for about 1 year and the house was a rental before we bought it. Given the state of other things we doubt the tank had been cleared of sediment in a long time. We did the water heater clearing today (the day after we flushed the hot water through the system). We had a good amount of sediment coming out and flushed the tank probably 3-4 times total over the course of today. Still had sediment coming out and the end but it got dark and we decided we can’t keep doing this so we stopped and let the tank fill up again and turned on the heat for the water tank again. This was about 3 hours ago that we finished. 

Still 3 hours later the hot water coming out of our taps is basically like lake water. It is very murky and it is also not getting hot at all. I’m afraid at this point that we’ve really screwed something up. Is there any advice that someone could offer or tell me what we should do next?

Thank you! - obviously getting a plumber out here is really hard right now with the backlog they all have right now.",,,1613969785

Then 8 min for hot water, all at once to clear out the hot water tank. This is what we were told to do. 

Now our water pressure is extremely low in the faucets and still flows fine for the shower/bathtubs. It’s been about an hour since we did this. Also, while we were flushing hot water some sand like substance found it’s way into the bathtub. Should we be worried or just give it more time to come back?

My family dog, Luna, has always loved food like any beagle. My parents had Covid beginning of January. Long story short my mom was fine but my dad (high risk) spent 4 days in the hospital and was in rough shape for about a month. During this time they saw my dog being very subdued and lethargic but we thought she was just upset that people were sick and that my dad was gone for a while. It’s been about 2 weeks since he got back and she’s still pretty lethargic and has within the past 3 days had a severely decreased appetite and is only wanting to be hand fed which has never happened. 

My Mom and sister took her to the vet today and they said she had extremely low red blood cells (600, whatever that means) and they needed to take her ASAP to get a transfusion at a place across town. They are waiting to set all that up now and I wanted to post here. 

I know Covid transfer to dogs has been extremely limited and I’m not trying to insinuate anything or make people panic but I wanted to know if it’s possible she got Covid, fought it off, and then her immune system overreacted? I read up on IMHA during this time as well. She was also very anemic with white gums and white inner

57M overweight (maybe ~ 230lbs, I’m not sure) 5’10” Type 2 diabetic

My dad started getting mild symptoms Monday (1/4)
He has been quarantining with my mom since March and we’re not sure how he got it. My mom got it a little before him but she is healthier and seems to be doing much better. Both tested positive.
Dad has been monitoring his oxygen and at the beginning it was the 97% range and he “felt fine” just a mild sore throat and a cough for the first 3 days. 

Now he’s coughing a lot (got a cough suppressant from doctor) feels overall horrible and his oxygen is in the 92-94% range. Mostly, he’s very scared. He feels really really bad and is afraid since he hasn’t gotten better from everything he’s taking. 
He is wanting to go to the ER and my mom is hesitant as she doesn’t think he’ll be admitted because in her opinion his symptoms aren’t that bad and she’s worried about all the activity being not great for him. 

On Monday (1/4) his doctor gave him an inhaler with steroids in it for his lungs as well as an oral steroid. I’m sorry I don’t know the exact names and with everything going on my mom is hard to get ahold of.

I am just very scared and not sure what to do or what to tell them. I live 4 hours away so it’s hard for me to get news and information real time.

If you just sent an email saying “hey can you wear these ears and mention my brand?” And she just said “yes” then that’s not really solid and not enforceable. Also I don’t think that would mean she can’t use them in her digital avatar because she can easily say she drew “inspiration” from many different ears. Which,

gqi209h,LiopleurodonMagic,Type1Diabetes,Thank you! We’ve been together for 6 years now and it’s definitely work but obviously worth it.

We walked around and there was no overly wet ground. I’m still convinced it has to be just low pressure but it’s also the only water we have issues with in the house so that’s why he thinks it has to do with the pipe.",t3_lode0h,t1_go5yy66,1613861531
go5yi4n,LiopleurodonMagic,HomeImprovement,So we have pretty much normal pressure everywhere except for the kitchen sink.

gntmbil,LiopleurodonMagic,LeopardsAteMyFace,"There’s more than a foot near our house in some areas. Mostly it’s about 10” since Sunday night. I’m not sure where people are getting “just 4 inches.” We had two storms, Sunday night and Tuesday night. Each of those storms brought 4-6” to my area, some areas got more. 

There is no delineation between peoples’ yards and the roads. There are no snow plows coming to roads that aren’t highways. There is no salting the roads. Our highways are mostly elevated and therefore have frozen solid. Mostly though, the main issue is some people have been without power in their homes since Sunday. People (especially elderly and disabled) are freezing to death in their own homes.

No one where I am now knows what’s that like to lose power for days and so no one stocked up on food or water. There are a good amount of people in actual very bad emergency situations (elderly, homeless, disabled, etc) and the rest just didn’t adequately know how to prepare. It’s not really their faults but they should have taken better steps.

Now you have people going to school for random degrees that make no sense but cost the same as all the others. It’s crazy. 

I tell people when they’re looking at different degrees to google “jobs for ____ majors” and see if they like what’s listed. If all that’s listed in minimum wage jobs or unrelated jobs then maybe it’s best to look for something else.

I had a job secured before I started my senior year. It was an immense weight off my shoulders knowing I had a way to pay off debt. A few years out and I’m almost completely debt free.

There’s also this toxic “everyone has to go to college” mentality. Lots of people aren’t cut out for college and there are amazing trade jobs where people are making bank because they’re such a demand for it. In my field we work with electricians and (without giving too much away) I went to a sort of trade show for people graduating electrician school.

If you’re going into college and considering a “fun” major I sincerely advise you to reconsider.

You really don’t know what’s going on in their lives. 

Money fades. Your family won’t remember you for your money. They’ll remember you for the time you spent with them and the memories you shared. That’s what your kids will look back on. I think the pandemic has helped a lot of people see that. 

I almost lost my dad a few weeks ago. It was very touch and go for a bit and very scary. Do you think I ever once thought back on how much money he made? No, I thought about all the trips we’d taken, how he’d helped me learn to ride a bike, all of his silly jokes and our references we make today.

gj0iqux,LiopleurodonMagic,tretinoin,"I’ve never gotten blood/hormone work done. They are pretty familiar with the different types of acne and can tell if it’s hormone based acne or not. 

You should tell them everything you’ve tried as well as the duration you tried them. Some products take time (like tret can take a year) and so if you say “I tried proactive for 2 months and saw nothing” that doesn’t mean they’ll rule that out for you. But it’s helpful to go through this journey with a doctors guidance so they can know if something is working for you or not. 

I would be surprised if you left without a product or a pill. I have very bad hormonal acne and so I take spironolactone in addition to my topicals. You shouldn’t be afraid of taking anything but just be sure you ask all questions. If you’re on birth control ask if it will affect birth control as well. 

Don’t give up. It may take a while for you to see results from something the derm gives you and it may take a while for you and the doctor to figure out what works best for your skin. 

Also, if your doctor is the type who is going to prescribe you stuff and then say “see you in a year” find a new doctor. They should be doing checkups much sooner than that to see how you’re getting on with your treatment.

Edit: I know you’re interested in starting tret and you can tell your Dermotologist that and ask if they think it will help your type of acne. You can also tell them you’d rather stick to topicals than take pills and that’s fine too. Just communicate with them.",t3_kv5n88,t1_gj0ccmo,1610469642

he will be driving at that time and he’ll be able to get into a lot more trouble. I’d just sit down with him and be honest and open, answer any questions he has as best as you can. You should bring it up earlier though if you feel like he’s getting into trouble and has been around alcohol/drugs before that. 

You can tie it into a drinking and driving conversation. Tell him no matter what if he’s ever anywhere and drinks that he should not drive and you will come pick him up and not be mad at him. Then work into “as we’re discussing alcohol I think you’re old enough now to tell you that addiction runs in your family and there have been a few family members that have struggled with alcohol/substance abuse. I don’t tell you this to make you afraid but you need to understand this and I want you to know so you can be careful.

It bothers me how many people jumped straight to “oh they’re just jealous.” Or they are his(?) parents and can see him working out everyday sometimes twice a day and limiting his calories as a real problem...which it is. You shouldn’t work out everyday without rest days, even if you’re trying to lose a lot of weight. Your body needs rest days. 

OP I suggest hearing your parents out and stop working out every single day. Cooking healthy food is a good thing but as a teenager limiting your calories on top of excessive exercise can do your body way more hard than good in the long term.",t3_kodqqv,t1_ghr30b9,1609531174

lhsgo6,amit0k,tifu,"TIFU by sending memes to Christian girlsSo I (21F) was in 9th grade when this actually happened but it’s still one of the funniest things that’s ever happened to me (maybe not so funny at the time, but hindsight is 20/20). 

I had just moved to a new district for the start of high school because I hated nearly everyone from my middle school and I was ready for a fresh start. During one of my classes, I started chatting with the girl sitting next to me (let’s call her Gabby). She was very sweet and offered that I sit with her and her friends during lunch. I took her up on that offer and I became friends with the group. This specific group was 3 super-Christian girls (I’m Jewish fyi) and a few other girls that weren’t so uptight. They were all very nice, don’t get me wrong, but I’ve never been friends with very religious people and I quickly found out that they aren’t my type. In addition to all the females, there was a group of 3 guys that would come and join us most of the time for lunch as well. These guys were a lot more my type. Raunchy, offensive and dark sense of humor. Naturally, I drifted more towards them as time moved. Regardless, we all had a group chat, initially for making plans but I used mostly to talk to the guys. 

To move on to the next part, I quickly need to identify two more people (changing their names for privacy). First, there’s Jessica, lead super-Christian who I initially thought was very sweet. Then there’s Rosen, one of the guys who also had a thing for me. Back to the story. 

As I previously described, I didn’t have the most innocent sense of humor and I liked pushing boundaries and pressing people’s buttons. Yes, I grew out of it, but it was 2014 and I was a high schooler who wanted to seem cool to the new group of guys I was trying to bond with. So, I sent a regrettable meme to the group chat in order to do just that. What was the meme? 

A photo of large, pink dildo, that instead of balls at the end, had a crucified Jesus Christ, and a caption that said “If you’re empty in your soul, put Jesus in your hole”.

I don’t know WHY I thought that would end well, and I was definitely pushing some buttons, but it was a hilarious photo and the guys clearly thought so. After my photo, Rosen decided to pitch in to the chaos and sent a link to the chat with a message saying “DO NOT PRESS THE LINK”. As you can imagine, seeing as we’re talking about the sense of humor of a 14 year old boy, it was a link of an overweight, brown guy with his cock out. Not as elegant as my meme, I must say, but it did the trick. Jessica texted the group chat asking us to please stop and we did, we got our laughs and we didn’t actually intend to offend her. I thought that would be that, but I was sorely mistaken.  

The next day at school, my teacher approaches me and asks me to go to the principal’s office. My heart stopped and I was filled with dread. I’m really not a troublemaker and I had no CLUE what I did wrong. Trembling, I made my way down to the principal’s office, and was led into a room where there was not one, not two, but THREE police officers. My heart was slamming against my chest, I wanted to vomit at this point. I took a seat and the police questioned what I sent to the group chat. Realizing that this is what this whole situation is about, I clearly stated “A picture of a Jesus dildo”. Trying to hide their amusement, the officers told me off, saying to respect other people and be mindful of what I send. I was out within 5 minutes, and as I was walking back towards my class I saw Rosen making HIS way to the principals. I stopped in my tracks and asked “What are you doing here?!” to which he responded “What are YOU doing here?”. I explained the situation and we realized he must have gotten busted as well for that link. I wished him luck and went back to class. 

Later that day, I talked to Gabby about how pissed I was at Jessica and what she did was super uncalled for. Then she started looking a little uncomfortable and I asked her if she knew what happened. She fessed up that SHE found the joke funny, but Jessica didn’t. So Jessica showed the texts to her mom. Who showed it to Gabby’s dad. Who then proceeded to call the principal, and was told that they can’t do anything since it didn’t take place on campus, which resulted in calling the POLICE. I was shocked and Gabby apologized profusely about her dad but I still blamed Jessica. 

The day ended with me going home and my mom questioning why she got a call from the principal. Feeling guilty as hell, I told her everything that happened, and she sternly asked what picture I sent in the first place to cause all this. I gave her my phone to show her, fully expecting her to ground me and yell at me for being disrespectful. Looking at my phone, her expression turned from anger, to realization, to amusement. A few seconds later, she started laughing really hard and gave me my phone back. She said the police was enough punishment for me and ever since then, I learned to be more careful about who I’m joking with and what it’s about. But on the other hand, Rosen and I have been dating for 5 years now. 

TLDR: Sent a picture of a Jesus dildo to a group chat full of super-Christians. Got the police called on me and lost a few friends.",,,1613071706

gn9ni4t,amit0k,AskReddit,"Shane Dawson. Everything he did in the past was extremely wrong, Im not denying it, but I’ve been a subscriber for 8 years and he was always getting views, reactions, and positive response to being shocking, disgusting and crossing the line. It’s how he became famous. That was the humor a decade ago. Again, doesn’t make it right, but when the positivity is outweighing the negativity, it’s hard to admit what you’re doing is wrong. While he has horrible choice of friends, I genuinely don’t believe he’s racist, sexist, a pedophile, or anything else he’s been accused of being. Watching hundreds of videos (especially when he used to post daily), you get to know a person. If I ever thought Shane genuinely held an ounce of prejudice in his heart, I wouldn’t support him. Lastly, he’s been molested as a child, it was always obvious to me that his dark sense of humor was his coping mechanism but oh well, if I say I don’t think Shane Dawson is horrible, apparently I’m horrible.",t3_lj0dby,t3_lj0dby,1613243049

It’s okay not to have the same morals as someone else and disagree with sex work but verbal abuse is not okay and sneaking through your phone without your consent is not okay. On top of that, I don’t feel you were wrong in not telling him. This is a relationship of 4 months, personally I don’t feel he’s entitled to know everything about your past and your secrets as it’s very new. It would be different if you were actually an escort but seeing as it’s something you’ve only done twice, I just don’t think you were obligated to tell him. He doesn’t sound like the kind of guy that would be willing to sit down and have an open and honest conversation about this, and while your intentions are pure, he  seems like he’s made up his mind.",t3_kofy64,t3_kofy64,1609537458
